"QBE North America Launches Diversity & Inclusion Speaker Series with Gay Former U.S. Marine ","",""," ##### In celebration of LGBT Pride Month, QBE North America last month sponsored its inaugural Diversity & Inclusion Speaker Series, featuring retired U.S. Marine Staff Sergeant Eric Alva. By coming out in 2007 as a gay former U.S. Marine, Mr. Alva played an integral role in the repeal of the 1993 “Don't ask, don't tell” policy that prohibited people who are openly gay from serving in the military, but protected solders from having to reveal their sexual orientation. ####  ##### Organized by QBE's PROUD Business Resource Group, a group consisting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, more than 150 people attended the standing-room-only event that included an audience of QBE employees, clients and community representatives. ####  ##### “I am a marine, veteran, Hispanic, disabled, gay man,” Mr. Alva said as he stood before the crowd, commanding its attention through his confidence in asserting that he belongs to four distinct groups within the spectrum of diversity. The impact of his statement set an endearing tone as he proceeded to share his story about DADT. ####  ##### Serving in the military had been a life-long dream for the former Marine, who began service at the age of 19. “I always looked up to my grandfather and my father, which I still do, and so, I always wanted to be in the military,” said Mr. Alva. “I wanted to serve my country.” ####  ##### Throughout his 13-year military career, Mr. Alva had been deployed to many locations around the world, including Somalia where he was involved in the logistics setup for Operation Restore Hope. But it was the last deployment of his career, Operation Iraqi Freedom, that would change his life forever. On March 21, 2003, the staff sergeant and 11 other troops had “stopped outside the city of Basra to re-group before entering the city to secure it from Iraq Forces,” he told the audience. Within three hours of occupying the area, Mr. Alva stepped on a land mine that exploded and seriously injured his right leg, which would become partially amputated, and also severed part of an index finger. “I thought I was going to die,” Alva said. “I started saying my goodbyes.” ####  ##### Mr. Alva spent seven months recovering from his injuries and preparing for his new life, which now included the category of “disabled,” yet he continued to conceal his sexual orientation: Gay. As the first American to be seriously injured during the war, this Purple Heart recipient received national attention, which included an interview with Oprah, an article in People magazine as well as a visit by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. ####  ##### The tragic incident had turned him into a celebrity who was also considered to be an eligible bachelor available for a bride. “Everybody put me up on this pedestal that he's the first American, he's our hero,” Mr. Alva explained. He was often approached by people who expressed “…you should marry my daughter or you should meet my daughter.” People wondered why he was always alone. ####  ##### Mr. Alva played the role of a straight man throughout his military career, knowing that DADT would end his military career with a dishonourable discharge if he had openly declared himself gay. Mr. Alva expressed to the crowd that he hated covering up his sexual orientation and “wondered what it would be like if people saw the truth.” However, one evening, he revealed to one of his colleagues that he was gay. The news quickly spread among his peer group, but it stopped there. They had all worked with him, they respected him, and they did not see where his sexual orientation had impacted his ability to do his job. No one ever reported the staff sergeant's secret. ####  ##### In 2004, after a seven-month stay in the hospital, Mr. Alva retired from the U.S. military and began to carve out a new life for himself by enrolling in college, majoring in social work. Mr. Alva said he began to learn more about, “my own diversity…disabled, Hispanic, a veteran and gay,” yet he continued to face the unsettling realization that while people were putting him on a pedestal, no one really knew the truth about who he was. ####  ##### In 2005, the state of Texas, where he resided, “passed a state constitutional ban against gay marriage. Other states were also proposing similar bans to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. “They had all these states where…I almost died for the people of this country, and I don't have the same opportunities or privileges or blessings, and that's so unfair,” said Mr. Alva. “I got to watching the news more…and I just finally…reached my boiling point.” ####  ##### Fed up with the limited rights for people who are LBGT, in 2006, the retired staff sergeant reached out to the Human Rights Campaign, a national group that advocates for LGBT rights, with the intent of simply volunteering but was met with the challenge to come out publicly. ####  ##### “You are like our golden ticket,” Mr. Alva said, recalling the HRC's response to his desire to volunteer. “You got injured in the war. You served your country, and there are people like you getting discharged every day…from the military just solely for being gay…come out publicly. Not just in your city, but to the world.” ####  ##### This was a huge responsibility, but with the encouragement and support of his parents, Mr. Alva moved forward with the HRC's plan. An initial step was Mr. Alva announcing his sexual orientation on the ABC News morning show Good Morning America. And a few months later, in 2007, he began working with members of the U.S. House of Representatives on the Military Readiness Enhancement Act to repeal DADT. ####  ##### Efforts to repeal the law included Mr. Alva testifying in 2008 before the House Armed Services Committee about his experiences, the contributions and skills of the members of military who are LGBT, and the thousands of men and women who had been discharged because of their sexual orientation. ####  ##### In December 2010, almost four years after publicly declaring that he was gay, the former staff sergeant stood next to President Obama as he signed into law the repeal of DADT. “You're standing next to the most powerful person in the world,” Mr. Alva said, “to watch him take the pen and put the ink to paper was historic.” ####  ##### The QBE Proud event was held in recognition of Gay Pride Month in June, which coincided with the tragic events in Orlando at a gay nightclub."" In remembrance of the victims and in acknowledgment of the LGBT community's fight towards acceptance and inclusion, QBE CEO Russ Johnston led the audience in a moment of silence. ####  ##### “The senseless attack on the LGBTQ community in Orlando sparked outrage in our company,” said Mr. Johnston. “The QBE Foundation made a $10,000 donation to Equality Florida Institute, Inc., and after the recent Orlando attack in the LGBTQ community, we are matching employee contributions to this charity which is supporting the victim's families.” ####  ##### Retired Staff Sergeant Eric Alva will be the closing keynote speaker at the Business Insurance “Absolute Inclusion” conference on Thursday, Sept. 29 in Chicago.

"View from Washington: Climate change questions","Opinion",""," ##### Will he or won’t he? That’s a question that applies to a lot of topics and will remain unanswered until President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. The subject I’m wondering about in particular is if Mr. Trump will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. ####  ##### The December 2015 accord was a milestone event that some doubted was possible. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations toward a potential solution to stave off the warming of the planet stalled for years due to bitter disputes over whether and how to mandate participation and who should pay for adaptation efforts in countries most vulnerable to climate change. But last year’s agreement on voluntary contributions aimed at holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels was a breakthrough in every sense of the word. ####  ##### This year’s talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, were rocked by the U.S. presidential election results, which introduced a layer of uncertainty and anxiety. ####  ##### But it also led other participating countries to express strong support and move forward on key procedural elements needed to fully implement the agreement. ####  ##### Before the election, Mr. Trump said he doesn’t believe that climate change is real, accused China of making up climate change to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive and vowed to dismantle the agreement. He has since softened his tone, saying he would keep an open mind. ####  ##### However, Mr. Trump’s selection of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the new head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not bode well for continued efforts by the federal government to address climate change impacts. Mr. Pruitt is a vocal opponent of current EPA efforts to restrain carbon emissions, even suing the agency over its Clean Power Plan — seen as a major contributor to the U.S. efforts to meet its Paris climate agreement reduction target. ####  ##### Any effort by the Trump administration to withdraw from the agreement would take time and could be met with resistance by other countries in the form of tariffs on U.S. goods — France has already threatened such action. And abandoning the Clean Power Plan is unlikely to reverse the trend away from fossil fuels toward cleaner forms of energy, with the boom in natural gas supplies making them more affordable than ever. ####  ##### But risk managers can’t afford to get bogged down in the political debate over climate change and the human contribution, as more than one person in the industry has told me recently. They must move fast to make sure their properties are protected from impending natural catastrophes, as well as the more gradual threat posed by rising sea levels, and that their supply chains remain intact. And they must get extremely creative as properties in certain parts of the world become uninsurable because of climate impacts. ####  ##### The question is will risk managers have an ally in Mr. Trump or will he hinder those efforts by abandoning the Clean Power Plan and withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement? We’ll know soon enough. #### "
"Legal developments in D&O","Opinion","D&O, E&O, General liability"," ##### When it comes to directors and officers liability insurance coverage litigation, a few key areas often pose challenges to insurers and to policyholders. ####  ##### Three significant issues that often arise in D&O disputes have recently been the subject of judicial developments: ####  ##### • Whether a settlement constitutes insurable “loss” under a D&O policy ####  ##### • Various cases interpreting the definition of “professional services” as used in D&O policies ####  ##### • Cases addressing the application of the “insured v. insured” exclusion in unusual circumstances ####  ##### Insurability of ‘loss’ ####  ##### D&O insurance policies provide coverage for “loss,” a defined term that typically includes settlements and judgments. As determined by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Level 3 Communications Inc. v. Federal Insurance Co. in 2001, “a ‘loss’ within the meaning of an insurance contract does not include the restoration of an ill-gotten gain.” This is the case for a number of reasons, including that an insured has not “lost” anything when he or she returns what he or she never should have had in the first place, as well as because of the moral hazard of allowing insurance coverage for such damages. Judge Richard Posner’s statement in Level 3 remains generally accepted as a principle by courts throughout the country. As such, by way of example, a settlement or judgment representing the return of ill-acquired lost profits would not constitute an insurable “loss” under insurance policies. ####  ##### In the past few years, however, a few courts have attempted to distinguish the circumstances presented in Level 3. These courts held that particular settlements did not constitute “restitution,” notwithstanding arguments by the insurer to the contrary. For example, in 2015 a Delaware trial court in Gallup Inc. v. Greenwich Insurance Co. held that it was insufficient for an insurer to point to the allegations in the underlying complaint as evidence that the settlement represented the return of ill-gotten gains, and required the insurer to provide evidence that the settlement was restitutionary. ####  ##### In 2016, another Delaware trial court held that a settlement payment did not constitute disgorgement in the absence of a “conclusive link” proving that the insured committed misconduct. In TIAA-CREF Individual & Institutional Services L.L.C. v. Illinois National Insurance Co., the court did note, however, that “a different outcome in which disgorgement payments are deemed insurable might result when parties settle under different circumstances.” Nevertheless, most courts use the allegations of a claimant’s complaint to determine whether a settlement or judgment is restitutionary in character. And, as noted, the TIAA-CREF and Gallup courts both allowed for the possibility that a settlement might constitute uninsurable restitution in other circumstances. As such, policyholders and insurers should closely examine the law of the relevant jurisdiction and the facts of a particular case in order to determine whether coverage could be available for a particular settlement. ####  ##### What are ‘professional services’? ####  ##### Whether a given activity constitutes a “professional service” is often important in D&O insurance for two separate reasons. ####  ##### First, many D&O policies contain a professional services exclusion that bars coverage for suits arising from an insured’s professional services. Second, some policies may be “blended” — meaning that they afford both traditional D&O insurance as well as traditional errors and omissions insurance, the latter of which usually affords specified coverage for errors and omissions in rendering an insured’s professional services. ####  ##### In 2015 in Goldberg v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., a Florida trial court ruled: “(T)he term ‘professional services’ unambiguously refers to services unique to a specific profession.” Two recent cases illustrate the distinction between services that are “unique” to a given profession and services that are not. ####  ##### In Goldberg v. National Union, a group of directors and officers of an insured bank were alleged to have engaged in managerial acts in furtherance of a Ponzi scheme by one of their customers. For instance, one of the officers was alleged to have “disregarded obvious warning flags, red flags, and overt warnings from some subordinates” about the Ponzi scheme. The directors and officers sought coverage under a D&O policy, asserting that the professional services exclusion did not bar coverage because they were engaged in “purely internal management and regulatory functions — not services for others.” The court disagreed, stating that any failure by the directors was “done in order to” facilitate the insured’s banking services for its customer. As such, these acts “arose out of” professional services performed by the insured. ####  ##### However, not every act by a professional will constitute a professional service. This is illustrated by the decision in a 2016 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Edwards v. Continental Casualty Co. There, an insured lawyer received a portion of a client’s personal injury settlement with the client’s employer pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement. ####  ##### The employer later sued to rescind the settlement agreement on the grounds that the client had feigned his injuries. The employer also sought the return of funds from the client’s lawyer, even though it alleged that the lawyer was unaware of the client’s conduct. In this case, the court held that the suit did not arise from an “act or omission” by the lawyer in rendering professional services. Rather, the lawyer was only named in the suit because he received the settlement funds at issue, not because he made some mistake in his conduct as a lawyer. ####  ##### Edwards was a 2-1 decision, demonstrating that where to draw the line between acts connected to professional services and those not connected can sometimes be debatable. As such, directors and officers should consider carrying both D&O and E&O insurance to limit potential gaps in coverage. ####  ##### ‘Insured v. insured’ exclusion ####  ##### Most D&O policies contain an “insured v. insured” exclusion, which bars coverage in connection with disputes brought by one insured against another. Among other purposes, such exclusions limit the potential for collusive disputes among various insured parties under a policy. They also avoid insuring against intrafamily disputes within an insured company. ####  ##### The applicability of the insured v. insured exclusion is not always clear-cut. To take one example, is a claim brought by the FDIC as receiver for a failed insured bank against the former directors of that insured bank a claim brought “on behalf of” one insured against another? ####  ##### Courts have recently come out on different sides of this issue. Last year, in St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the exclusion was ambiguous as to the FDIC, and therefore held that the exclusion did not preclude coverage. ####  ##### However, courts analyzing different policy language have interpreted the exclusion differently. In Hawker v. BancInsure Inc., a California trial court considered whether an exclusion barring coverage for “a claim by, or on behalf of, or at the behest of, any other insured person, the company, or any successor, trustee, assignee or receiver of the company” barred coverage for claims brought by the FDIC as receiver against insureds. Here, the policy language specifically referred to any “receiver” of the company. ####  ##### Accordingly, the court concluded that this claim for coverage by the FDIC failed. ####  ##### Like those issues with receivership, issues concerning insolvency or bankruptcy of insureds have posed challenges for courts interpreting insured v. insured exclusions in recent years. For example, in 2016 in Indian Harbor Insurance Co. v. Zucker, a Michigan trial court considered whether coverage for a claim brought by a litigation trust of an insured bank against its former directors or officers was precluded by an insured v. insured exclusion that barred coverage where a claim was brought “in the name or right of” the insured bank. The court determined that it was. The court surveyed case law nationwide, and noted that there were a number of “inconsistent decisions across the country” concerning the insured v. insured exclusion. ####  ##### In this case, the court held that the litigation trust’s claim was precluded. The court performed a fact-specific inquiry, and concluded that the fact that the insured bank “voluntarily” transferred causes of action to the litigation trust created a “direct connection” between the bank and the trust. Accordingly, the court held that the insured v. insured exclusion applied to bar coverage. As this illustrates, application of this exclusion is not always clear-cut, and courts will closely examine relevant policy language and the specific facts and circumstances of the matter to determine whether coverage is barred by an insured v. insured exclusion. ####  ##### David H.

"Business interruption meets cyber risk coverage","Opinion","Cyber Risks, Excess & Surplus Lines, P/C Insurers"," ##### As more businesses come to realize that cyber attacks pose a serious threat to business operations, revenue streams and contingency planning, the market is starting to expand and develop new products to address business interruption, or BI, resulting from a cyber attack. Some of the more common cyber attacks against businesses include denial-of-service, brute force (to obtain passwords), insertion of malware or malicious code, ransomware, backdoor attacks and social engineering. This article provides a primer on the issues that may arise when the traditional concept of first-party BI coverage is married to cyber coverage. ####  ##### BI coverage is a time-element coverage offered under first-party property policies. In the first-party context, for BI coverage to be implicated, there must be insured direct physical loss or damage by a covered cause of loss that causes a necessary interruption of the insured’s operations, either wholly or partially as specified in the policy. Once these conditions are met, then the actual loss sustained is measured to determine the loss of business income from the interruption. ####  ##### It is important to remember that first-party property policies do not traditionally extend property loss or damage to electronic data, as data is not considered a physical or tangible object subject to loss or damage. When BI coverage is offered for cyber policies, the direct physical loss or damage requirement may be substituted with an electronic data driven event — a specified type of cyber attack. ####  ##### The scope and elements of what constitutes a cyber attack in the policy is therefore of critical importance. In other words, what triggers BI coverage for a network attack? As noted above, BI coverage was originally intended for physical loss and is now being imported into the ethereal and nonphysical world. ####  ##### As part of a triggering event for BI coverage, there must be a direct causal connection between the cyber attack and the interruption of business and loss of revenue. For an active attack, where an adversary or perpetrator destroys or alters data that brings down the computer system, or a denial of service takes place and business operations cease, the causal connection to any business loss should be fairly straightforward to establish. ####  ##### However, the causal connection is less clear in a situation involving a passive network attack, when a computer system is infiltrated but the perpetrator is only gathering data or exploring the system, and no data is disturbed, altered or destroyed. ####  ##### In such a situation, a network attack took place and remedial measures are necessary, but computer operations may continue uninterrupted while the security of the system is being restored and any malicious software is neutralized. Although the cyber policy may respond and pay for the expenses to restore the network security under other coverages, a BI loss has not been established inasmuch as there would be no interruption of operations. ####  ##### Another scenario could involve a passive attack combined with a public disclosure that an insured’s network has been compromised. In that situation, daily business operations would continue unhindered, but there might be a loss of customers and revenue resulting from security concerns. On one hand, the network attack took place and the loss of network security is driving away customers; the insured is likely to contend that network security is an intrinsic service that it provides to customers. ####  ##### On the other hand, relying on traditional concepts of BI coverage, there would be no complete or even partial suspension of the insured’s network operations. The loss of revenue would be based on customers’ decisions, and thus the causal connection of what is being insured — suspension/ interruption of operations — is not tied to the loss of revenue. Additionally, if the customer no longer wants the insured’s services, that may also be a “loss of market” situation, which is normally excluded in BI policies. ####  ##### There are countless cyber attack situations that can arise. Therefore, when a cyber attack claim is presented and adjusted, the policy wording and what constitutes the triggering event, as well as the causal relationship of the network attack to the revenue loss, must be examined closely. At times, it may be a challenge to correlate which incurred costs are associated with the covered event versus noncovered costs, such as a permanent upgrade to network security. Adding to the complexity of analyzing a cyber BI claim is the insurer’s reliance on the insured’s cooperation on openly sharing what exactly took place in its system from the attack and how these compromised systems tie into its operations and revenue streams. ####  ##### As part of BI coverage, the extent of financial reimbursement for a covered revenue loss is also controlled by other important policy provisions, as listed below: ####  ##### • The specified BI sublimit in the policy will set forth the maximum BI exposure for the insurer. Regardless of the revenue loss, the BI sublimit caps the payout under the policy. The BI sublimit may at times be tied to an annual BI aggregate limit — the maximum payable in the policy period if separate network attacks take place. ####  ##### • Policies that provide BI coverage will often include a separate BI deductible or BI waiting period, either in hours or days, before liability will arise under the policy. If a BI loss is below the deductible or does not exceed the waiting period, then the policy will not respond. An example of the waiting period not being met would be if a denial-of-service lasts two hours and the waiting period is four hours. ####  ##### • BI policies will also provide that liability is only for the specified period of restoration. This period is usually a defined time period and requires the insured to use due diligence and dispatch to resume its operations. ####  ##### • BI coverage for network attacks is usually restricted by excepting certain types of costs that are not covered. Costs that are not covered can include third-party liability, contractual liability, fines and penalties, and upgrades for the restoration of network security. ####  ##### • In addition to certain types of noncovered costs, there will be certain BI exclusions, that can include idle periods when insured is not in operation for other reasons, consequential loss or loss of market. In addition, cyber policies typically exclude loss by insured perils under a first-party property policy, such as fire, smoke, explosion, earthquake and other events, as these physical perils are not the intended risk being insured. Service interruption of utilities is also commonly excluded. ####  ##### Unlike other types of insurance, BI coverage is more nuanced, in that overlapping conditions must be examined as part of the determination of whether a BI claim is compensable. The starting point for making such an analysis is a comprehensive understanding of the cyber attack that took place, what was affected and its impact on operations, along with a careful reading of the policy. ####  ##### Costantino P.

"View from Washington: GOP fails legislative debut","Opinion",""," ##### Will the self-inflicted death blow to the Republicans’ first major legislative effort spell disaster for the rest of their agenda? ####  ##### The Republican effort to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law imploded last month when the U.S. House of Representatives abandoned Speaker Paul Ryan’s proposed legislation due to a shortage of yea votes. ####  ##### The Republican proponents of the bill did their best to cherry-pick parts of a Congressional Budget Office estimate that worked in their favor, namely that the bill would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion over the 2017-2026 period. At their worst, they also criticized the hard-working CBO employees for their prediction that 24 million people would be left uninsured under the legislation. But the bill was clearly doomed by a combination of public outcry over the prospect of a huge increase in the number of people uninsured, which spooked some Republican legislators, and conservative Republicans’ feeling that the replacement bill did not go far enough in unwinding the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### The Republican Party was so deeply divided over whether to demolish the law or reform it in a way that kept some of its most popular provisions that not even threats from their Twitter-happy leader could compel members to get in line to vote for the bill. ####  ##### “We had no votes from the Democrats,” President Trump said in trying to pass the blame. ####  ##### No kidding. The Democrats were not going to help the Republicans in any way, shape or form overturn the health care law after they paid such a high political price for that legislative victory in the midterm elections during Mr. Obama’s first term. And the Democrats are clearly in no mood to cooperate on much else these days, as demonstrated by their threatened filibuster of the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### “He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.” So, the Republicans face the prospect of heading into the April recess having failed both to repeal a law they have been railing against for the better part of seven years and to confirm the president’s choice for the Supreme Court seat. ####  ##### What’s next? Well, President Trump may be ready to move on to something that he understands from his days as a businessman is quite complicated: reforming the U.S. tax code. His tax plan pledged that “no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop,” will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Comprehensive tax reform could benefit the bottom line of insurers, and therefore, insurance buyers. ####  ##### Republicans could also continue their deregulation push. Largely on party-line votes, Congress has quickly adopted several Congressional Review Act resolutions overturning Obama administration midnight rules, including a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation mandating employers keep injury and illness records for five years. I’d expect more tight votes on regulations that continue to divide the parties, including the Federal Communications Commission’s internet privacy rules adopted last October. ####  ##### But the Republicans failed their first major test by not agreeing on how to do away with Obamacare. That does not bode well for the rest of their agenda. #### "
"Insurers must take the lead on disaster resilience coverage","Opinion",""," ##### Wildfires in California and Alberta, floods in Louisiana, drought and Ebola in Africa and Zika in the Americas and Asia: all reminders of how unprepared we are for the natural catastrophes that accompany climate change and globalization. They are reminders, too, that public and charitable funding for disaster recovery is often inconsistent, inefficient, and insufficient. ####  ##### But a new group of public-private partnerships has pioneered a different approach to recovery funding — using insurance mechanisms to shift risk from public agencies to international financial markets, and leveraging philanthropic and public-sector funds to develop new innovative risk-sharing programs. ####  ##### By creating ways to cover occurrences once considered uninsurable, these publicprivate partnerships have turned disaster recovery into a robust business and investment opportunity — for example, catastrophe bond purchases have grown 10% annually since 2009, with $26 billion currently in the market. And they have given public agencies a very cost-effective financing tool: Lloyd’s Global Underinsurance Report published in October 2012 indicated that a 1% increase in insurance penetration can reduce the cost of disasters to taxpayers by up to 22%. A recent example of making insurance markets work for a greater public good is the $29 million insurance payout from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility to Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, the Grenadines and Barbados, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. Though modest, the money has been used to help at least 1.4 million affected people to date. ####  ##### The insurance industry has been a “slow follower” in this important new market, initially questioning whether events such as climate change and disease epidemics were insurable propositions, and whether such products could drive revenues. Yet disaster resilience insurance is indeed proving to be viable, providing an attractive opportunity for the insurance industry — a virtually untapped global market, where big-data and remote sensing technologies ease risk analysis and pricing, and funding from philanthropies and governments reduces initial product research and development costs. ####  ##### Given the size of this new market — research from Swiss Re Ltd. in 2015 notes that 70% of global economic losses from natural disasters are uninsured, as are 80% to 100% of all economic losses in emerging markets — the disaster insurance business could help relieve the industry’s current problems with weak economic forecasts, underutilized capital and mounting competition in their traditional markets. ####  ##### One of the market’s pioneering efforts is the Extreme Climate Facility, or XCF, being created by African Risk Capacity, a Johannesburg-based agency of the African Union. Designed to help African governments address climate change-driven weather shocks such as extreme heat and droughts, XCF will issue up to a billion dollars’ worth of catastrophe bonds in the next three decades — with coupon payments or premiums to global investors, funded in this case by international development organizations and foundations. ####  ##### Another innovative program in the works is the Pandemic Emergency Financing facility, an insurance solution for curbing pandemic risk launched by the Washingtonbased World Bank Group. Funded by investor-purchased “pandemic catastrophe bonds” and by insurance and reinsurance contracts with coupon payments funded by development organizations, the PEF seeks to enable fast response to pandemics in low-income countries. ####  ##### Building on cornerstones such as CCRIF, ARC and the PEF, the disaster resilience insurance market is poised to grow for decades. And insurers should be entering the market — working closely with governments, development organizations and philanthropies to create customertailored products. As they do, they should be mindful of the lessons learned by the market’s pioneers and note three imperatives: ####  ##### Imperative One: Align expectations about what insurance can do. ####  ##### Too often, public and development-sector organizations, including nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations and foundations, view insurance as a panacea for disaster response. In reality, it works only for carefully defined, nonfrequent events. It cannot underwrite broad disaster recovery capacities, nor eliminate the need for preparedness funding from public coffers, development loans, and international aid. ####  ##### Insurers must help development-sector organizations understand what these products are meant to accomplish, generally and specifically. They need to ensure that payers and policyholders know exactly what their policies will and won’t pay for and prompt them to develop a funding plan for essential services or commodities uncovered by insurance. ####  ##### If companies fail in this “education” imperative, they risk having disappointed public- and development-sector leaders question the effectiveness and value of these products as public finance tools. ####  ##### Imperative Two: Reduce any complexity and uncertainty that slows down payouts. ####  ##### A core benefit of disaster resilience insurance is quick access to funds, circumventing delays by bureaucratic, process-heavy public systems and international development agencies. Anything that slows down payouts diminishes their value at the front end of crises. This happened in Mexico last year after Hurricane Patricia. The government had previously issued a $315 million catastrophe bond, which seemingly transferred the risk of hurricane losses to global capital markets and locked in disaster-relief funding. Unfortunately, the payout was delayed three months by disagreement on whether the event warranted a 100% payout or merely 50%. ####  ##### To avoid these situations, companies must identify and where necessary develop mechanisms and triggers that leave no room for dispute between themselves, payers, regulators and policyholders. ####  ##### Imperative Three: Create a safety net to mitigate innovation risk. ####  ##### The disaster resilience insurance market is still nascent and there will be growing pains. Risk is unavoidable when innovation is so central to the market’s development and when the market’s context — a world undergoing climate change and issues increasingly crossing national boundaries — is uniquely unsettled. The private sector understands these challenges. It accepts that not all disaster resilience insurance solutions will work as intended right out of the box. It knows that complex products often need recalibration and refinement. ####  ##### But public- and development-sector leaders do not have the same tolerance for risk or patience for the process, especially when it means that the poor and vulnerable populations affected by catastrophes are left even more exposed to suffering. ####  ##### African Risk Capacity confronted this risk-tolerance problem when a drought insurance product purchased by the Government of Malawi initially underestimated the number of people affected by drought during the 2015-2016 season. As a result, despite widespread shortage of rain and food on the ground, a payout was not triggered. ####  ##### The problem was one of data used, not intent or technology; and the situation was ultimately resolved when it was determined through field surveys that the governmentprovided technical data underpinning the insurance contract, including the variety of maize used for farming, was not in line with the actual farmer practices. ####  ##### Insurers should anticipate the differential in risk tolerance and address it head-on with their public-, development- and philanthropicsector partners. Their mutual goal should be creating a “safety net” that permits product innovation and refinement while protecting affected populations. One option is a contingency fund to help communities when an insurance product needs technical recalibration. This kind of joint investment will afford insurers space and time to reinforce the quality and credibility of the disaster resilience insurance model. ####  ##### Toward both profit and resilience ####  ##### Disaster resilience insurance can become an indispensable product — a major contributor to public-sector recovery funding and a robust new market for insurers whose traditional business lines are constricting. But for disaster resilience insurance to succeed, insurers must take the lead. They must guide their new collaborators through the complex process of creating and refining products. They must foster the market’s growth by promoting wide adoption of their products. They must build confidence that their products will consistently help to protect vulnerable communities around the globe. ####  ##### Saadia Madsbjerg is a managing director with The Rockefeller Foundation.

"View from Washington: Will Trump get another chance at high court pick?","Opinion",""," ##### Will the U.S. Supreme Court’s so-called swing vote swing the court in favor of employers by giving up his seat? ####  ##### Mere days after Neil Gorsuch was officially sworn in to fill the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 came speculation that 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has been on the court since 1988, could soon retire. The speculation was fueled by someone presumably in the know: Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. While he didn’t specifically name Justice Kennedy, Sen. Grassley said he expected a justice resignation as soon as this summer. ####  ##### This news is noteworthy coming so quickly after Justice Gorsuch was confirmed using the “nuclear option,” meaning Senate rules were changed to allow his confirmation with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Now that the precedent has been set, far more controversial justices on either end of the political spectrum could be approved with simple majority votes. ####  ##### Justice Gorsuch was generally seen as a good pick for employers, although perhaps not as good as Justice Scalia. But the newest associate justice — so new his picture is still not up on the Supreme Court’s biography page — is clearly no fan of the Chevron deference, which refers to the concept established in a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court case, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc., that requires courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of laws it implements or enforces. The Chevron deference is already under challenge via a legislative proposal, but even if that bill doesn’t pass, Justice Gorsuch’s resistance to the concept bodes well for employers who may find themselves on the wrong end of workplace safety citations from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration or enforcement orders from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or another federal agency. ####  ##### Justice Gorsuch once clerked for Justice Kennedy, who has been the deciding vote on many critical and controversial decisions, including Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case in which the Supreme Court decided by a 5-4 margin that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed a fundamental marriage right to same-sex couples. Liberals would be wise to worry that a replacement selected by President Donald Trump and confirmed by a simple majority in the Senate could tip the balance of power to the conservative side for years to come and leave them on the losing side of cases such as Obergefell. Even though the president and then-nominee Gorsuch have both called same-sex marriage “settled law,” there’s no guarantee that a Justice Kennedy replacement would feel the same. ####  ##### But for now, employers have Justice Kennedy in the middle of the restored balance of conservatives and liberals on the court. How long that lasts will be a great guessing game — something Washington excels at. #### "
"Ten considerations for projecting self-insured workers compensation losses ","Opinion","Workers Comp Cost Control, Workers Comp Coverage"," ##### Projecting self-insured workers compensation losses is a complex process due to its long-tail nature and the many factors that can significantly impact the final costs of claims. A proper actuarial review can provide valuable insight and tailor estimates to each unique self-insurance program. The following discusses the top 10 considerations used by actuaries for projecting self-insured workers compensation losses and integrating them into the projection process. ####  ##### 1. Collecting claims and exposure data ####  ##### Claims and exposure data are the key inputs when projecting self-insured losses. It is important to keep clean, organized records of a program’s historical data because inconsistencies can compromise the accuracy of results. Treatment of subrogation and other recoveries should be clearly and consistently applied. Likewise, allocated loss adjustment expenses should be treated consistently if losses are limited to retention, as they may not erode the limit depending on the excess insurance or large deductible policy purchased. In addition, policies may include other limits or deductibles , which need to be captured. Payroll is often chosen as a preferred exposure metric because it directly correlates with the cost of benefits provided to injured employees, but it can be inconsistently measured. Items excluded should remain constant over time, such as bonuses and vacation time. Because exposures are used on a relative basis to measure change in program size, a change in reporting of exposures can signal a false change in program size. ####  ##### 2. Loss development ####  ##### Loss development serves as the foundation for many estimation methods used by actuaries when selecting ultimate losses. Data is usually organized into so-called loss development triangles, which are constructed using claims data — often organized by accident/policy period — at multiple valuation dates and which present an effective way to analyze how a program’s losses have developed over time. It may be useful to split data into different triangle subsets if it is believed that losses from certain business segments or geographical regions could develop in significantly different ways from others. Losses from different states can show different development patterns due to differences in benefit laws and legal environments. It may also be worthwhile to build triangles by job type or class code. ####  ##### Loss development factors, or LDFs, are selected for each development period from the triangles. The first step is deciding if a program’s experience is fully credible or if it should be supplemented with industry development factors. The selection of tail development is especially critical, as it affects LDFs for all younger development periods. In addition, LDFs must be tailored to the specific needs and experience of each data set. If LDFs are limited to a retention that is different from the projected losses, it may not be appropriate to use those LDFs in the projection process. LDFs can be adjusted to various retentions, but theoretical increases or decreases may not be appropriate based on a program’s history. ####  ##### 3. Determining trends ####  ##### In addition to selecting LDFs, frequency and severity trends should also be reviewed. There is a common misconception that they are accounted for when developing losses. This is known as “the overlap fallacy.” Applying trend to claims data adjusts losses to a desired exposure period to account for nominal cost differences between years, while developing losses estimates the final costs of all claims — also referred to as ultimate losses. If a program’s data is considered credible enough to estimate trends and they are significantly different from the industry, it must be demonstrated to auditors that the utilized trends are appropriate. It is important to also recognize what type of trend is needed when dealing with severity, specifically whether inflationary trend should be included. In addition, exposure trends, as measured through payroll, should be accounted for and should consider any shift in class codes of workers. ####  ##### 4. Selection of methods ####  ##### Actuaries utilize multiple estimation methods when selecting ultimate losses for each accident/policy period. Some methods rely strictly on current claims values and the selected LDFs; others rely on historical claims averages and ignore how claims for a specific year have developed so far; and others weigh actual and theoretical experience together. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of how the various methods react to data and program changes is essential to selecting appropriate ultimates. There are also times when commonly accepted actuarial methods do not produce intuitive results. It is critical that the actuary step back from the methods and apply business sense, because any movement in ultimate losses affects the bottom line. Additionally, selected ultimate losses for prior years hold an extra level of importance because a prospective year’s loss estimate is typically based on historical experience. ####  ##### 5. Large losses ####  ##### Large losses are inevitable. Two key considerations are how much do current estimates include for possible future large losses, and how much impact do large losses have on future projections. It must be considered whether a large loss is an anomaly or an indicator of possible future large losses. In order to minimize fluctuation in reserve estimates that are due to large losses, selected ultimates should include some provision for potential large losses or additional incurred but not reported, or IBNR, costs. IBNR losses represent unreported losses and can arise from unreported claims, development on known claims, reopening of claims or claims in transit. The majority of workers compensation IBNR costs are for development on known and reopened claims. A conservative approach would hold a healthy amount of IBNR and slowly lower estimates over time if large losses do not occur as a year matures. For older years, the reporting of a large loss may result in a dollar-for-dollar increase in ultimates, because less IBNR is typically held for more mature years. If large losses are not expected to occur every year, estimates for each individual year may not need to hold enough protection against a large loss. Collectively, however, there should be enough IBNR to absorb some expected level of large losses without significantly raising ultimates in total. ####  ##### 6. Stability vs. responsiveness ####  ##### Selected LDFs, ultimates, severity and frequency trends, and other model assumptions all affect the level of stability when projecting workers compensation losses. Estimates for younger years are typically based on theoretical methods that are more stable compared with methods that rely heavily on actual claims experience. For example, if a large loss is reported within the first six months of a policy year, a method that relies solely on actual claims experience will assume continuing large development in the future and can potentially overestimate ultimate losses. A balance must be achieved between overreacting and reacting too slowly to new information. ####  ##### 7. Program changes ####  ##### Possible changes to a program may include size of retention, purchase or sale of a division, changes in claims handling and new loss initiatives. Adjustments for retention typically use increased limit factors, or ILFs, which can be based on an industry source or a program’s own data. Similar to limiting LDFs, theoretical increases or decreases based on industry experience may not be appropriate, and actuarial judgment must be exercised when selecting appropriate ILFs. Adjustments for the purchase or sale of a division are more complex and must be tailored for each scenario. Adjustments for changes in claims handling and new loss initiatives must also be tailored for each scenario. For example, a switch from using a third-party administrator to handling claims in-house may result in more focus being placed on gathering claims detail and closing claims more quickly. ####  ##### 8. Special considerations ####  ##### Changes to reserving methodology and timing of claims payments can have significant effects on the accuracy of LDFs and associated estimation methods. For example, if there is an increase in case reserve adequacy, ultimate losses will likely be overstated unless the necessary adjustments are made. Changes to employee mix — due to layoffs or changes in business — may also have a significant impact on the accuracy of estimation methods. An additional consideration includes any new initiatives to improve safety that will influence workers’ attitudes toward claims. ####  ##### 9. Issues specific to workers compensation ####  ##### Workers compensation benefits are highly dependent on state and jurisdiction. Prior claims must be adjusted for any new benefit laws put into place when projecting losses. Additions of new locations may also require adjustments to make sure prior claims are level with expected future losses, if the new locations fall within jurisdictions known to be different from current locations. ####  ##### Workers compensation exposures have very long tails. For example, a minor back injury today may require back surgery five years from now. An experienced actuary will factor in a provision for IBNR to protect against these late claims cost increases. ####  ##### 10. Financial reporting ####  ##### Although the long-tail nature of workers compensation adds complexity to projecting losses, it offers a great advantage for discounting liabilities from a financial perspective. Discount factors are based on a chosen interest rate and the estimated payment pattern from the selected LDFs. The discount rate is usually provided by the company, but an actuary would be able to provide guidance related to interest rates similar companies are using. An actuary would also be able to provide expertise in estimating liabilities at various probability levels above the actuarial central estimate using loss distributions for programs that are interested in evaluating different degrees of conservatism. ####  ##### Conclusion ####  ##### When projecting workers compensation losses, it is beneficial to have a strong understanding of the many pieces that affect results. If carried reserves are understated, accruals will be inadequate. If carried reserves are overstated, capital is tied up and unavailable for other strategic uses. It is always a best practice that management works closely with the actuary to fully understand the analysis and newlyfounded insights. ####  ##### Carly Rowland is a consulting actuary at Milliman Inc..

"Finding the right insurance coverage helps mitigate ransomware exposures ","Opinion","Cyber Risks"," ##### Ransomware has become frighteningly pervasive and increasingly serious — a reality punctuated by the massive global WannaCry cyber attack that recently affected tens of thousands of organizations across a wide range of industry sectors. ####  ##### Organizations can proactively manage ransomware risk through the adoption and implementation of robust cyber security and business continuity practices, and by training employees how to spot and avoid social engineering exploits, such as phishing emails. But there is no such thing as perfect cyber security, limits exist around what is feasible in terms of security and business continuity planning, and mistakes happen. Organizations must accept that they may face a ransomware attack. ####  ##### Insurance can play a vital role in a company’s overall strategy to address, mitigate and maximize protection against the losses and exposures relating to a ransomware attack. Importantly, virtually all standalone cyber insurance policies offer specific coverage for ransomware and other forms of cyber extortion, in addition to other standard coverages. ####  ##### Although cyber insurance can be extremely valuable, obtaining the right cyber insurance product presents significant challenges. There is no standardization among cyber insurance policies, notwithstanding that the associated marketing materials frequently make it seem as though the majority of policies available today are capable of an apples-to-apples comparison. This could hardly be further from reality. Cyber insurance policies vary dramatically. Although this creates challenges, it also creates opportunities. ####  ##### Owing in part of the lack of standardization, organizations can achieve significant negotiated enhancements to off-the-shelf cyber insurance forms that dramatically broaden the coverage. Many, if not the majority, of these enhancements involve no increase in premium. ####  ##### Organizations initially purchasing or renewing this type of coverage are well advised to engage the assistance of knowledgeable outside counsel at the outset to ensure that the appropriate insurance is in place when an attack occurs, and that coverage is maximized in the wake of an attack. ####  ##### Here are 10 tips for maximizing coverage for ransomware and other forms of cyber extortion. ####  ##### • Obtain a broad scope of coverage. Cyber extortion coverage should be written to cover as broad a range of potential threats as possible. The coverage should not be limited to ransomware, but should also cover the various other forms of cyber extortion potentially faced by the organization, including threats to obtain or release protected information — such as personally identifiable customer data, protected health information and confidential corporate information — or to discharge denial-of-service attacks that disrupt an organization’s networks, causing business interruption. By way of example, one recent off-the-shelf cyber policy extortion coverage grant promises to “reimburse Extortion Expenses incurred by an Insured in response to … an actual Network Extortion Threat,” which is defined to list specific types of attacks: “[A]ny credible threat or series of related threats directed at an Insured to: release, divulge, disseminate, destroy or use Protected Information or confidential corporate information of an Insured taken from an Insured as a result of the unauthorized access to or unauthorized use of an Insured’s Computer System or Shared Computer System; cause a Network Security Failure; alter, corrupt, damage, manipulate, misappropriate, delete or destroy Digital Data; or restrict or inhibit access to an Insured’s Computer System or Shared Computer System.” It is important to understand and negotiate the key definitions that define the scope of coverage to ensure that they are sufficiently broad to match the reality of risk faced by the insured organization. ####  ##### • Obtain a broad definition of covered loss. Covered loss should include reasonable and necessary expenses incurred as a result of a covered threat, including the costs of investigating and assessing a threat, even if no ransom is paid; payment of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin; any other consideration or action that may be demanded by the extortionists; and reasonable expenses incurred to mitigate or reduce other covered expenses. ####  ##### • Pay attention to conditions. Organizations are advised to pay close attention to policy conditions, including notice and consent provisions, proof of loss provisions, allocation provisions, alternative dispute resolution provisions and any requirements that the organization notify law enforcement of the incident at issue. ####  ##### • Beware of exclusions. Like any other insurance policy, a cyber policy may contain exclusions that may significantly curtail and undermine the purpose of the coverage. For example, some insurers insert exclusions based on purported shortcomings in the insured’s cyber security. Following one health care-related data breach, for example, CNA Financial Corp. filed coverage litigation against its insured, Cottage Health, seeking to avoid coverage based on an exclusion in the NetProtect360 policy at issue, entitled “Failure to Follow Minimum Required Practices.” Citing the exclusion, CNA alleged that coverage was barred because its insured failed to “continuously implement the procedures and risk controls identified in its application,” to “regularly check and maintain security patches on its systems” and to “enhance risk controls,” among a host of “other things.” These types of exclusions, which are sometimes included in other insurers’ policies, too, should be rejected. ####  ##### • Be aware of sublimits. Cyber extortion coverage may be written subject to a relatively low sublimit, such that, for example, a $10 million limit primary policy may provide only $250,000 or $500,000 for cyber extortion losses. As with the case of other cyber insurance terms and conditions, sublimits usually are negotiable, and should be sufficiently high to cover reasonably projected exposure. ####  ##### • Obtain a “discovery” trigger. Cyber extortion coverage should specify that the coverage is triggered by the insured’s “discovery” of a threat, rather than by the occurrence of an incident after a certain “retroactive date.” ####  ##### • WannaCry? Notify! Insurance policies typically contain notification provisions stating that the insured must provide notice “as soon as practicable” after it becomes aware of an incident. It is important to reasonably comply with notice provisions in order to not jeopardize coverage. It is important, moreover, for organizations to recognize that what begins as a relatively low cyber extortion demand may evolve into an incident, or series of related events, that triggers other coverage sections of the policy. Indeed, a ransom demand may be deployed as a purposeful diversion from a different, principal goal, such as stealing sensitive records. ####  ##### • Obtain “consent.” Cyber extortion coverage invariably will contain a “consent” provision, which will require the insured organization first obtain the insurer’s approval to pay or incur costs, including the payment of ransom. Toward the goal of obtaining coverage, it is important that the insured reasonably comply with these types of provisions. Policies may be negotiated to state that the insurer’s consent may “not be unreasonably withheld.” ####  ##### • Maximize coverage across the entire insurance program. Organizations are advised to consider all potentially applicable insurance coverages. A cyber extortion incident may trigger, for example, computer crime policies, kidnap and ransom policies and traditional property policies. The various policies that may be triggered by a cyber attack likely carry different limits, deductibles, retentions and other self-insurance features, together with various potentially conflicting provisions addressing other insurance, erosion of self-insurance and stacking of limits. It is important to carefully consider the best strategy for pursuing coverage in a manner that will most effectively and efficiently maximize the potentially available coverage across the insured’s entire insurance portfolio. ####  ##### • Don’t take “no” for an answer. Unfortunately, even where there is a legitimate claim for coverage under the policy language and applicable law, an insurer may deny an insured’s claim. Organizations that refuse to take “no” for an answer may be able to secure valuable coverage if they effectively pursue their claim. ####  ##### Roberta D.

"View from Washington: Insurers silent on climate","Opinion",""," ##### President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement last month — a decision I suspect the United States will quickly come to regret. ####  ##### The Paris agreement reaffirmed a goal of limiting the global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius and committed countries to develop plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and regularly report on their progress. The United States, under former President Barack Obama, was one of 195 countries signing on to the agreement. But President Trump’s decision to withdraw will allow countries such as China and India to further shape a global agreement that will dramatically impact the United States regardless of its lack of participation. ####  ##### The backlash to the president’s decision in much of the business community and at the state and local levels was swift and unmistakable. But there was a critical voice that was missing: the U.S. insurance sector. ####  ##### Perhaps it is a fear of offending customers who reject either the very idea of climate change or the fact that human behavior is a significant contributor to global warming that has kept domestic insurers, and even the trade associations that normally speak for them on political issues, mostly on the sidelines. ####  ##### But that silence works against them because they are abdicating an opportunity to play a constructive role in addressing a serious threat to their own profitability, as the natural catastrophes that they are financially responsible for will only get worse without timely intervention. ####  ##### Their European reinsurance counterparts are not nearly as skittish, with officials from Munich Reinsurance America Inc. and Swiss Re Ltd. denouncing the president’s decision to withdraw. They should be commended for their willingness to publicly oppose an action they know will keep the United States from being a critical player in addressing what their own research tells them is a real threat to human life and property. ####  ##### Insurers are going to have to deal with the climate issue some way or the other. California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones launched the Climate Risk Carbon Initiative in January 2016 to require insurers with $100 million in annual premiums doing business in California to disclose investments in fossil fuels and asked all insurers operating in the state to divest investments in thermal coal. He recently vowed to continue this initiative despite a threat of legal action by Republican officials in 13 states, predominantly those with major oil, gas and coal interests. As Mr. Jones stated in his response, there is overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is real and should not be ignored. ####  ##### The 2004 disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow” depicted the consequences of failing to heed warnings on climate change, including devastating catastrophes in areas of the United States where they are least expected. While the movie significantly exaggerates the time frame of these events for dramatic purposes, two key elements ring true: that human behavior is contributing to a changing climate and that those in power who can act to prevent catastrophic climate change often ignore the scientific warnings until it’s too late. ####  ##### President Trump has failed to heed these warnings. It’s time for others to step up. #### "
"No longer stuck in the weeds: Marijuana insurance moves into the mainstream","Opinion",""," ##### Medical marijuana is now legal in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Eight states and the District of Columbia now have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Recent polls indicate 61% of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized. ####  ##### In light of these legalizations and the new attitude, policyholders, agents and insurers have been reconsidering the insurability of marijuana-based industries in the United States. Today, the trend is to allow them to be insured. Many insurers see the marijuana industry as no different than any other. In fact, many insurers believe the risk posed by the marijuana industry is similar to the risk posed by the alcohol industry and believe that both should be insured in a similar manner. ####  ##### For many years, marijuana was illegal. Thus, simply put, any insurance of marijuana growing or selling operations was considered uninsurable because of policy provisions relating to illegal operations or the public policy against insuring illegal actions. Sometimes this public policy was expressed statutorily, in that a state law made it clear that an insured could have no insurable interest in a property if it was an illegal interest. As recently as 2012, case law expressed this in regard to marijuana. In Tracy v. USAA Casualty Insurance Co., heard in federal district court in Honolulu, Barbara Tracy had marijuana plants stolen from her property. She filed a claim with USAA, which denied her claim on the grounds that she lacked an insurable interest. USAA referred to the following Hawaii statute which stated: “No contract of insurance on property or of any interest therein or arising therefrom shall be enforceable except for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the property insured. Insurable interest means any lawful and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance free from loss, destruction or pecuniary damage.” ####  ##### USAA argued that since marijuana was illegal under federal law, marijuana plants could not be insured. The plants were not lawful, and there was no insurable interest. The insurer never mentioned state law. The court agreed, and denied Ms. Tracy recovery. But this was 2012, not 1962. The Tracy v. USAA case raised howls of protest. In response to the Tracy decision, in Oregon, where medical marijuana was legal, a statute was passed that specifically stated that no contract would be unenforceable on the basis that the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possessing or use of marijuana was prohibited by federal law. Washington, on the other hand, made marijuana legal. ####  ##### Here is the problem: if marijuana is lawful under state law then, at least under state law, it should be insurable. However, if marijuana is still classified as a banned controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, insurers could still use illegality as a defense. Still, it will be less likely today to be successful. ####  ##### The “Cole Memo” of 2013, which was issued by the Obama administration’s Justice Department led many to believe that federal marijuana laws would not be enforced in states that had legalized marijuana use. The memo hinted that as long as these states took steps to regulate possession, prohibit trafficking across state lines and keep marijuana away from minors, the federal government would leave marijuana alone. In effect, marijuana was legal on the federal level. That would seem to cure all problems regarding insurability. Now, however, a new administration has threatened enforcement of federal drug laws concerning marijuana. While it remains to be seen whether this enforcement will be carried out, could this once again change the game? ####  ##### Probably not for insurance industry purposes because many agents and brokers are now insuring risks with full knowledge that they are insuring the marijuana industry. This waives any illegality defense. The 2016 The Green Earth Wellness Center L.L.C. v. Atain Specialty Insurance Co. case in a federal district court in Denver addresses this issue. Green Earth operated a retail medical marijuana dispensary and a growing facility. A wildfire damaged its operation. The insurer sought to deny coverage on many grounds, one of which was that the policy was void on public policy grounds because the subject of the risk was illegal marijuana. The court disagreed, stating that the insurer knew what the risk involved when it entered into the policy. ####  ##### Moreover, it appears that no state insurance regulatory authority has prohibited issuing insurance to the marijuana industry. It appears that most American insurers now indeed do so. There is a notable holdout: Lloyd’s of London has instructed its syndicates to not write the industry because marijuana is still listed as a scheduled drug under federal law. This is a minority position and is likely to change. ####  ##### Regarding first-party coverage, it appears that marijuana industries are being insured under the same forms as any other industry. There are some unique aspects, however — not as to the forms, but regarding the business. The “grow” operation is intense, needing ventilation controls, irrigation systems and special lamps. Damage to these systems can be costly. It has been suggested that since marijuana is a lucrative business that business interruption limits be kept at a high level because the potential for lost profits is great. Since marijuana is highly desirable, the risk of theft will be high, leading to a need for theft insurance with increased limits. Moreover, large amounts of cash are usually on hand at marijuana dispensaries, leading to a greater risk of robbery and more expensive coverage. ####  ##### Commercial general liability insurance will also be needed and, as stated, will be directly comparable to CGL policies obtained by the alcohol industry. A major risk would be dram shop liability cases. No state has yet imputed vicarious liability to a marijuana business for an injury caused by a person to whom the business sold marijuana. However, there seems to be no logical reason why an attempt to impose this type of liability will not occur. Failure-to-warn claims will also probably occur, alleging a business failed to communicate the hazards of marijuana to a purchaser or end user. One particular area to be examined is whether there can be coverage for any raid and seizure conducted by the federal government in a location where marijuana is legal under state law but where the federal government is enforcing federal law. To date, this has not been the subject of a claim, but new enforcement actions could bring this about. ####  ##### Inland marine insurance is one area where special forms are arising. The transport of marijuana is highly regulated. Once again, the highly lucrative nature of the product being transported makes its carriers a tempting target. There are now specialized clauses insuring cannabis transport, requiring strict security procedures, such as transport of cannabis only in armored vehicles, two drivers in vehicles at all times and strict criminal background checks for all drivers.

"United Continental to issue first note to PBGC for pension takeover","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, P/C Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits"," ##### CHICAGO—United Continental Holdings Inc. says it will issue a $62.5 million note to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the first payment the holding company has made as part of a 2005 agreement to have the PBGC to take over four underfunded United Airlines' pension plans. ####  ##### Under the agreement, United, which merged last year with Continental Airlines, is required to issue a $62.5 million note whenever EBITDAR—or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent—exceeds $3.5 billion over a 12-month period. United Continental said Thursday that a triggering event occurred as of June 30. ####  ##### The airline will be required to furnish the note, which carries an 8% interest rate, by Feb. 14, 2012. Interest will be paid twice a year. The note expires on June 30, 2026, though United Continental can call in the note at any time at par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ####  ##### Under the 2005 agreement, United Continental is liable to issue the $62.5 million note in any year that the EBITDAR trigger is hit through 2017.  That could require the airline to issue up to $500 million in notes. ####  ##### Largest PBGC loss ever ####  ##### The PBGC’s takeover of the four United plans with more than 121,000 participants resulted in a $6.6 billion loss, the largest loss incurred by the agency since it was established in 1974 as part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ####  ##### In fiscal 2010, the PBGC reported a near-record $23 billion deficit in its insurance programs, which are used to guarantee benefits in plans the agency takes over from failed companies, or from employers so financially distressed that they no longer can afford to fund their pension plans. ####  ##### The failure of the United plans and the massive loss incurred by the PBGC was a key factor that led Congress the following year to pass legislation tightening pension funding rules as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. #### "
"Express buy of Medco rouses consumer foes ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Regulation, Express Scripts, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### WASHINGTON (Reuters)—Express Scripts Inc.’s planned buy of Medco Health Solutions Inc. met with swift opposition from consumer advocates and drug stores, signaling the beginning of what could be an ugly fight for antitrust approval. ####  ##### The $29.1 billion deal would create a powerhouse in managing prescription drug benefits. Its only other real competitor would be CVS Caremark Corp., at No. 2, and possibly UnitedHealth Group. ####  ##### “This is an area where there is already tremendous concentration,” said Sharon Treat, executive director of the National Legislative Assn. on Prescription Drug Prices. “If you look at who has all the (pharmacy benefits ) contracts, it’s going to be concentrated on the Big 3 which would now be the Big 2.” ####  ##### Ms. Treat believes the combination will raise prices for consumers at the drugstore due to the lack of competition. ####  ##### Antitrust regulators tend to look skeptically at deals which reduce the number of competitors in an industry from four to three, and take an even harder look at deals that reduce the number of competitors to two. ####  ##### Community pharmacy groups were already consulting with the Federal Trade Commission and state prosecutors on their next steps in opposing the deal, the National Community Pharmacists Assn. and National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores said in a joint statement. ####  ##### “The major (pharmacy benefits managers) already wield an unchecked, one-sided advantage in setting contract and reimbursement terms for community pharmacists, undermining their viability to continue serving patients,” said Douglas Hoey, NCPA head, in an emailed statement. “Approval of this merger would further distort this marketplace, to the detriment of patients, true competition and lower prices,” he said. ####  ##### Like merging Visa, Mastercard? ####  ##### The review itself will take considerably longer than the four months that the FTC took to approve pharmacy giant CVS’s purchase of Caremark, which closed in 2007, said an antitrust expert who asked not to be named. ####  ##### Antitrust regulators could well take a hard look at how many options big companies have when they look for a pharmacy benefits contractor, said this expert. ####  ##### “The question is how many alternatives do large companies have?” this person asked. “When a large company goes out to bid its (drug) plan, how many options do they have?” ####  ##### The FTC is already investigating CVS Caremark after allegations that it has used its pharmacy benefits business to steer customers to CVS pharmacies rather than allowing customers to go where they choose. ####  ##### The three companies’—CVS, Express and Medco—share of the large-plan market could well be 80%, said David Balto, a former FTC policy director now in private practice. ####  ##### “This is terrible for consumers. This is like Visa and MasterCard merging,” he said. ####  ##### Analysts said approval was a gamble, while noting that sophisticated corporations only rarely announce major deals that they cannot shepherd through to approval. ####  ##### “The companies I’m sure have investigated this and they think that they have a decent shot of it, although it’s notable that there’s no financial penalties in the deal if it doesn’t get approved by regulators,” said Morningstar analyst Matthew Coffina. “They’re just making a bet at this point that regulators will go along with it.” #### "

"Via Christi Health asks ok to use captive to fund benefit risks","Benefits Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits"," ##### WASHINGTON—Via Christi Health Inc., a Wichita, Kan.-based health care system, is asking the Labor Department for permission to use the U.S. Virgin Islands branch of its Cayman Island captive insurance company to fund life insurance risks. ####  ##### Under the proposal, the policies would be written by Minnesota Life Insurance Co., which would reinsure the risk through the Virgin Islands branch. The branch was established in September to reinsure Via Christi employee benefit risks. ####  ##### Via Christi, which says it is the largest provider of health care services in Kansas, fully or partially owns or manages 12 hospitals in the state.

"401(k) plan participation could fall victim to proposed health care affordability test","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### WASHINGTON—Without modification, a proposed Internal Revenue Service health care reform law affordability test could encourage some employers to drop programs intended to encourage employee participation in 401(k) plans, a benefits trade group says. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014, employers are liable for an annual $3,000-per-employee penalty for employees whose required health insurance premium contribution for single coverage exceeds 9.5% of family income and the employees are eligible for federal premium subsidies to buy coverage through state insurance exchanges. ####  ##### In September, the IRS asked for public comment on a proposed safe harbor in which coverage would be considered affordable as long as the premium contribution for single coverage did not exceed 9.5% of an employee's W-2 wages. ####  ##### But in a letter sent Tuesday to the IRS, the American Benefits Council said using wages, as reported in Box 1 of the W-2 wage and income statement, to determine if the required premium contribution is affordable “seems to create a possible disincentive for employers regarding programs and features designed to increase employee participation” in 401(k) plans. ####  ##### That's because Box 1 wages are reduced by the amount of an employee's pretax contributions to a 401(k) plan, the Washington-based ABC said in its letter. ####  ##### “Thus, for example, someone who defers amounts into a 401(k) plan will have lower wages reported in Box 1 of the Form W-2 and, as a result, his or her employer-provided coverage…is more likely to be unaffordable when compared to another employee that makes fewer or no elective deferrals,” ABC said in its letter. ####  ##### Given the increased likelihood of failing the affordability test and being hit with stiff financial penalties, employers might pull back on programs, like automatic enrollment, that lead to increased employee participation in 401(k) plans, the group added. ####  ##### A simple remedy to the problem, ABC suggested to Treasury Department regulators, would be—for the purpose of satisfying the W-2 health care premium affordability test—to allow employers to count employees' pretax benefit plan contributions as wages. #### "

Benefit payments would increase to $678 million in 2013 and $738 million in 2014, according to a 2010 10-K report—the latest available—filed by parent company AMR Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas. ####  ##### From 2015 through 2019, plan participants would receive $4.63 billion in payments from the airline's plans. ####  ##### If the plans are terminated, the PBGC would be responsible for paying the bulk of those promised benefits. ####  ##### The PBGC says that according to its preliminary estimates, it would be liable for a total of about $17 billion in benefits earned by American Airlines employees, retirees and dependents. ####  ##### The PBGC does not have a breakout of the benefit payments it would have to make over the next seven years. ####  ##### The PBGC, though, would not be liable for all pension benefits earned by the airline's employees and retirees.

"Law will cut defined benefit pension contributions, but increase PBGC premiums ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management"," ##### WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama has signed into law legislation that will allow employers to slash their defined benefit plan contributions by billions of dollars throughout the next several years, but it also boosts their pension insurance premiums. ####  ##### The pension-related provisions were included as part of a broader transportation funding bill, H.R. 4348, that President Obama signed Friday. ####  ##### Under the new law, employers can use higher interest rates to value plan liabilities, thus reducing the value of the liabilities and the contributions they must make to the plans. ####  ##### Employers will continue to value plan liabilities based on interest rates on top-rated corporate bonds for three different segments, averaged over 24 months. Segments refer to when benefits are paid to participants. ####  ##### Under this methodology, interest rates that value plan liabilities are based on the maturity date of the corporate bonds. For example, interest rates on pension liabilities to be paid within the next five years will be based on corporate bonds maturing within five years. ####  ##### Over the next decade, the interest rate changes will boost federal tax revenues by more than $9.4 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.  That is because using higher interest rates will decrease the value of plan liabilities, reducing required tax-deductible plan contributions, which in turn will increase employers' taxable incomes. ####  ##### However, the actual interest rate for each segment in 2012 would have to be within 10% of the average of those segment rates for the preceding 25-year period. In succeeding years, this 10% corridor would increase and top out at 30% in 2016. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Due to this change in methodology, the interest rate used to value benefits paid over the next five years will increase roughly three percentage points, with smaller, though still significant, percentage increases for benefits paid beyond five years, experts say. ####  ##### However, the new law also increases premiums that employers pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which has a $26 billion deficit in its insurance programs that guarantee most vested benefits to participants in plans the agency takes over from financially troubled employers. ####  ##### All employers with defined benefit plans pay an annual PBGC premium of $35 per plan participant. The new law will raise the premium to $42 in 2013 and to $49 in 2014. ####  ##### In addition, the law increases the variable rate premium that is assessed on employers with underfunded plans. ####  ##### Under the law, the current variable rate premium of $9 per $1,000 of plan underfunding will be indexed to wage inflation starting next year. In addition, the premium will automatically increase by $4 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2014 and by $5 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2015. ####  ##### However, regardless of the amount of the underfunding, the maximum variable rate premium cannot exceed $400 per participant. ####  ##### PBGC Director Joshua Gotbaum preferred a different approach. In a statement this month, he said the agency would have preferred if Congress gave the PBGC would have been given authority to set premiums based on an employer's creditworthiness. #### "

"PBGC backs plan for no lump-sum pension payments to American pilots","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. disclosed Friday that it supports American Airlines Inc. parent AMR Corp.'s request to a federal bankruptcy court for permission to allow the airline to amend its frozen pilots' pension plan so that retiring pilots cannot receive their accrued benefits as a lump sum. ####  ##### The PBGC said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that elimination of the lump-sum option is necessary to avoid a distress plan termination before AMR emerges from bankruptcy and a huge loss to the PBGC. ####  ##### The bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on AMR's proposal. ####  ##### In its filing, the PBGC, which reported a record $29.1 billion deficit in fiscal 2012 in its insurance program for single-employer plans, said it would incur a $2.3 billion loss if it took over the American pilots' plan. ####  ##### In a previous filing with the bankruptcy court, AMR warned that the availability of the lump-sum option would lead to mass retirements of pilots. ####  ##### Under one scenario outlined by AMR, a 50-year-old pilot, for example, “may conclude that he or she can have the best of both worlds by retiring from American with a substantial lump sum while continuing to fly the most prestigious aircraft at a top salary for a foreign airline.” ####  ##### A surge in retirements “would create a pilot shortage which, in turn, would result in an operational crisis involving the wholesale cancellation of flights and the grounding of airplanes, with a corresponding devastating reduction in revenue and profitability,” AMR said in its filing. ####  ##### To prevent that from happening, American would be forced to seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate the plan, AMR said. That would shift liability to pay the plan's promised but unfunded benefits from American to the PBGC. #### "
"Mass. Connector Authority head to lead state's finance office ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation"," ##### Glen Shor, the executive director of Massachusetts' Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, will leave in early January to become secretary of the state's Executive Office of Administration and Finance, a cabinet-level position. ####  ##### The Connector Authority is the Massachusetts agency responsible for administering key parts of the state's landmark 2006 health care reform law. ####  ##### Mr. Shor assumed his position at the Connector Authority in June 2010, when he succeeded Jon Kingsdale, the authority's first executive director. Jean Yang, the Connector Authority's chief financial officer, will replace Mr. Shor. ####  ##### The Connector Authority administers two state health insurance exchanges:  Commonwealth Care, which provides state-subsidized coverage to 198,000 lower-income state residents; and Commonwealth Choice, which provides access to coverage for residents not eligible for employer coverage. While the state does not subsidize the premiums for coverage in Commonwealth Choice, which has about 43,000 enrollees, the premiums charged often are substantially lower than those in the nongroup market. ####  ##### Those programs have helped Massachusetts achieve the lowest uninsured rate — 3.4% in 2011 — of any state, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. ####  ##### The changes were announced Thursday by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. #### "
"Verizon completes annuity purchase to transfer pension plan obligations","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Verizon Communications Inc. disclosed Monday that it has completed its purchase of a giant group annuity to transfer about $7.5 billion in pension plan obligations to Prudential Insurance Co. of America. ####  ##### The arrangement covers about 41,000 management participants who retired and began receiving pension benefits before Jan. 1, 2010. Verizon contributed about $2.6 billion to the plan in connection to the transaction, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### “The transaction is expected to further Verizon's objective of de-risking the pension plan while improving the company's longer-term financial profile,” New York-based Verizon said. ####  ##### Verizon's move came after that of General Motors Co., which purchased a group annuity — also from Prudential — to cover the benefits of tens of thousands of participants in its pension plan for salaried employees. ####  ##### More employers are expected to follow the paths blazed by GM and Verizon, experts say. Through purchasing an annuity and transferring the benefit obligations to an insurer, employers will save on costs such as premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., as well as fees and costs associated with offering and administering their pension plans. ####  ##### In addition, employers taking such actions no longer will be exposed to fluctuating interest rates and investment results, which can cause major changes in their pension plans costs and contributions. #### "

"HHS rejects Mississippi's state insurance exchange application","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### (Reuters) — Mississippi on Friday became the first state to have its proposal for a health insurance exchange rejected by the U.S. government, and federal officials said Republican Gov. Phil Bryant's opposition to the plan was to blame. ####  ##### ""With a lack of support from your governor and no formal commitment to coordinate from other state agencies, we do not see a feasible pathway to conditionally approving a state-based exchange in Mississippi for 2014,"" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a letter to the state. ####  ##### Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, a Republican, had waged a bitter battle with Gov. Bryant and other fellow party leaders in his state over implementing a state-run health insurance exchange. ####  ##### The exchanges are a central provision of Democratic President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under the law, all states must have fully operational health insurance exchanges by Jan. 1, 2014. ####  ##### Gov. Bryant opposes a state-run system, saying it opens the door to the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to by critics as ""Obamacare."" The governor has said it will shackle the state with debt related to inflated Medicaid rolls. ####  ##### Mr. Chaney also opposes the federal health care reform law. But he has argued a state-run system would let Mississippi control its own insurance market, saving thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in the long run. ####  ##### The commissioner has been working on the exchange for years and became a resource for other states trying to devise their own plans. Mississippi submitted its proposal to the federal government in November. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Chaney's office said it would have further comment on the matter later on Friday. ####  ##### An exchange allows consumers to compare plans provided by health care providers in an effort to make them more transparent and get more people enrolled. If states fail to implement their own exchanges, the federal government will do it for them. ####  ##### Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have received conditional approval to establish their own state exchanges. ####  ##### States have the choice of rejecting the exchange provision outright, or following Delaware and Arkansas by participating in federal partnership exchanges that would allow them to manage insurance plans and aid consumers. ####  ##### The deadline for states to declare their intentions to run federal partnership exchanges is Feb. 15. The Health and Human Services Department said on Friday that it considered Mississippi ""an excellent candidate"" for that model. #### "
"Funded levels of GM pension plans up, size of plans down","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The funded levels of General Motors Co.'s U.S. pension plans inched up in 2012, while the size of plans dropped amid the implementation of GM's trailblazing “de-risking” strategy. ####  ##### At year-end 2012, the plans were underfunded by $13.1 billion, down from $13.3 billion at year-end 2011, the big automaker reported Thursday. The plans' funding level, though, slipped to 84%, down from 88% at year-end 2011. ####  ##### The size of the GM plans was dramatically smaller compared to 2011. At year-end 2012, the plans had $81.2 billion in liabilities and $68.1 billion in assets. A year earlier, the plans had $107.7 billion in liabilities and $94.3 billion in assets. ####  ##### That $26.5 billion reduction in liabilities was the result of twin actions GM took in 2012 to reduce pension plan size. One of those steps was an offer GM made to 44,000 salaried employees who retired after Oct. 1, 1997, and before Dec. 1, 2011, to convert their monthly annuities to a cash lump sum payment. In all, about 13,000 accepted the offer. ####  ##### In addition, as the second part of its pension de-risking strategy, GM purchased a group annuity from Prudential Insurance Co. of America. ####  ##### The Prudential annuity replaced benefits that salaried employees who retired before Oct. 1, 1997, received from GM, as well as retirees who declined the lump sum conversion offer. ####  ##### GM has said the twin de-risking approaches dramatically reduced the size of its salaried U.S. pension plan. On Jan. 1, 2012, the plan had $35.9 billion in benefit obligations and $33.3 billion in assets. In early November, GM reported that salaried plan obligations had fallen to $9.2 billion and assets to $6.1 billion. #### "
"GOP lawmakers back Hobby Lobby contraception suit","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### Eleven Republican lawmakers have signed an amicus brief that challenges the Obama administration's contraception coverage mandate by arguing the policy violates religious freedom. ####  ##### The brief, filed Tuesday with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, is part of a lawsuit filed by Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., a chain of Christian-owned craft retailers based in Oklahoma. The store's owners argue that the mandate, which requires employers to provide insurance that covers contraception at no out-of-pocket cost to enrollees, violates their religious principles and is unconstitutional. Hobby Lobby's suit was filed against HHS and Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ####  ##### “Congress has commanded equal treatment of all under a religion-protective rule,” the brief read. “Defendants may not pick and choose whose exercise of religion is protected and whose is not.” ####  ##### Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Dan Coats, R-Ind., Thad Cochran, R-Miss., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Jim Inhofe, (R-Okla., Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Richard Shelby, R-Ala., signed the brief, as well as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and  Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Frank Wolf, R-Va. ####  ##### The lawmakers are citing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. ####  ##### “Religious freedom is an issue our country was founded on, and it's not a Democrat or Republican issue,” Sen. Hatch said in a news release. ####  ##### “Unfortunately, the Obama administration has time and again ignored calls to stop the implementation of a policy some organizations or businesses are morally opposed to.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Catholic health providers made a similar argument when HHS unveiled its contraception mandate. Last May three Catholic health systems joined other Catholic groups in filing 12 federal lawsuits questioning the law, which went into effect earlier this year. ####  ##### The Catholic Health Association declined comment on the brief. The CHA supported the ACA, but disagreed with the mandate as written and asked HHS to reconsider the policy. Last week, the CHA issued a statement on a revised mandate that once again expressed concerns over how the government defined a religious employer and what groups would be exempt from the mandate. They called the revisions “substantial progress,” but cautioned more work was needed. ####  ##### Ashok Selvam writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Communications vital when changing retiree medical plan structures","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### NEW YORK — Employers planning to transition their group retiree medical benefit plans to individually purchased exchange-based models must carefully consider how the change in benefit structures will be communicated to current and future retirees, benefit managers say. ####  ##### During a panel discussion on Thursday at the 2013 Employee Health Care Conference in New York, benefit managers for Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer A.G. and Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle A.S. outlined the processes by which their separate companies exited their employer-sponsored group retiree health plans in favor of coverages purchased through private exchanges. ####  ##### At both companies, panelists said clear and consistent communication strategies encompassing current and future retirees — as well as senior corporate leadership — were vital to the success of their shifts to the individual markets. ####  ##### “As we were implementing this, the communication portion was really a key part of the strategy for us,” said Mike Holian, Nestle's Cleveland-based vice president of employee financial shared services. “The senior management was really anxious about disrupting our retiree population.” ####  ##### Beginning in January, Nestle shifted its U.S.-based Medicare-eligible retirees to an employer group waiver plan, or EGWP, with a wraparound secondary plan for pharmaceutical benefits, while its pre-65 and future retirees were transitioned to individual plans purchased through private exchanges operated by New York-based Towers Watson & Co. and its recently-purchased exchange service provider, San Mateo, Calif.-based Extend Health Inc. ####  ##### During the planning phases of the change-over, Mr. Holian said his team was instructed to devise a post-employment benefits solution that, above all, would not adversely impact the company's retirees, balancing the affordability and sustainability of the program, as well as capitalizing on efficiencies available in the marketplace and, where possible, using third-party funding to reduce costs for Nestle and its employees. ####  ##### “There was a fair amount of complexity involved in getting buy-in to all the changes that we were trying to make,” Mr. Holian said. “The primary goal here was really not about savings, but instead about how we could make this plan better for the retirees going forward in a way that was sustainable.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Similarly, Bayer migrated most of its current and future U.S. retiree population — including most nonunion Medicare retirees — into individual defined-contribution plans purchased through the Extend Health exchange. ####  ##### The company used savings earned from the termination of its group retiree medical plans and its retiree life insurance program to fund an increase to its 401(k) matching contributions and to establish a retiree medical savings account program for employees hired after Jan. 1, 2005, who are not eligible for the defined contribution for medical benefits. ####  ##### “When we communicated all of these changes, we centered those communications on the idea of retirement security,” said Lori Lechner, Bayer's Pittsburgh-based director of benefits planning. “I feel strongly that what we did was move an unprotected benefit to a protected benefit. That was an important message for us to communicate to the employees.” ####  ##### All told, Ms. Lechner said Bayer migrated nearly 7,300 retirees — about 93% of the company’s total U.S. retiree population — and their spouses into its exchange-based plans for the 2013 plan year. More importantly, she said, the company was able to successfully contact and inform 99% of its retiree population about the changes to their medical benefits. ####  ##### “We had a lot of printed material and hosted at least 27 on-site retiree meetings, and encouraged them to set up a one-on-one appointment with Extend Health’s benefit advisors,” Ms. Lechner said. “We sent out several reminder notices as well, because we really didn’t want any retiree feeling like they were left behind.” ####  ##### As was the case at Nestle, Ms. Lechner said securing executive-level support for the transition plan was at times challenging but ultimately crucial to its success. ####  ##### “It was really important to us to make sure that our senior leadership and (human resources) managers understood what we were doing, and understood that they may get questions from employees and retirees or comments that people weren’t happy with the change,” Ms. Lechner said. “A decision like this will always result in noise, but they had to understand that this was something that we felt was the right thing to do.” #### "

Instead, they can give a link in the notice to a Department of Health and Human Services website, www.healthcare.gov, that has such information. ####  ##### “That is very good news,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants L.L.C. in Secaucus, N.J. Employers had been concerned about the possibility that they would have had to provide contact information for all 50 public exchanges. ####  ##### Employers must distribute the notices, which are available at www.dol.gov/ebsa, prior to Oct. 1, 2013.

"More employers offer contraceptive, same-sex benefits: SHRM study","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### The percentage of employers that cover contraceptives in their group health benefit plans has risen more than 16 percentage points in the past five years, according to a report by the Society for Human Resource Management. ####  ##### Eighty-two percent of employers surveyed in Alexandria, Va.-based SHRM's 2013 Employee Benefits Report indicated they cover contraceptives under their group health plan, up from 73% in 2012 and 66% in 2009. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, most employers with more than 50 full-time employees — and/or their insurers — are required to provide cost-free coverage for contraceptive prescriptions and other women's preventative care services. ####  ##### Small employers with fewer than 50 full-time workers that do not offer employee health benefits, as well as certain types of religious employers, are exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirements. ####  ##### The controversial provision has been challenged in federal courts by as many as 32 for-profit companies and 30 nonprofit organizations, according to the Washington-based Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. In most cases, the plaintiffs allege the requirement violates their rights to religious expression under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment. ####  ##### To date, federal courts have granted preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the requirement to 20 for-profit employers pending the outcome of their lawsuits. Another seven employers have been denied injunctions, according to the Beckett Fund. ####  ##### SHRM's study also noted a slight rise in the percentage of employers offering health care coverage and other benefits to employees' same-sex domestic partners. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Thirty-seven percent of employers polled in the 2013 study provide health care coverage for same-sex domestic partners, up from 35% in 2012. ####  ##### The study noted a much steeper rise in the percentage of employers offering nonhealth benefits to same-sex domestic partners, including wellness, paid leave, retirement savings and planning, financial and compensation, and professional and career development benefits. Twenty-four percent of employers in 2013 said they provide employees' same-sex domestic partners with nonhealth benefits, up from 15% in 2012. ####  ##### Several other specific health-related benefits have seen significant increases in popularity among employers since 2009, the study noted. The percentages of employers offering mental health coverage, supplemental accident insurance, health savings accounts, coverage for corrective laser eye surgery, acupuncture and elective procedures have all grown five to 10 percentage points in the past five years. ####  ##### As the range of benefits offered appears to be expanding, employers' preferences regarding the structure of their group health plans have slowly migrated toward preferred provider organization-based plans. ####  ##### An overwhelming majority of employers surveyed  offer PPO health plans — 86% in 2013 compared with 83% in 2012 and 81% in 2009. The prevalence of health maintenance organization plans among employers increased by a single percentage point, to 33% in 2013 from 32% in 2012, but remained below the 35% of employers recorded in 2009. ####  ##### Point-of-service plans, meanwhile, have decreased steadily in the past five years, to 19% of employers in 2013 from 26% in 2009. ####  ##### The full results of SHRM's 2013 Employee Benefits Report are available here. #### "

Diebold has about 6,800 U.S. employees. ####  ##### “Diebold is getting more aggressive in its cost-saving efforts moving forward.

"Conestoga Wood Specialties denied challenge to contraceptive rule","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits"," ##### The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia on Wednesday denied Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp.'s application to re-argue its challenge of the health care reform law's contraceptive coverage requirement before the court's full roster of active judges. ####  ##### The East Earl, Pa.-based woodworking company is among the two dozen for-profit, family-owned businesses separately seeking to block the federal government from forcing employers with 50 or more employees to provide cost-free coverage for contraceptive prescriptions and other women's preventative care services under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### The requirement, contained within the reform law's minimum coverage standards for employer-sponsored health benefits, went into effect last August. ####  ##### Conestoga Wood Specialties' application for a second hearing before the appeals court was voted down by seven of the court's 12 active judges. Last month, a panel of three 3rd Circuit judges rejected the company's initial appeal, in which it had hoped to overturn a lower court's January 11 ruling denying the company's motion for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the coverage requirement pending the outcome of the lawsuit. ####  ##### Having exhausted their opportunities for relief at the appellate level, attorneys representing Conestoga said in an email to Business Insurance that they will petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a reversal of both lower courts' rulings. ####  ##### “Every American, including family business owners, should be free to live and do business according to their faith,” said Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based conservative legal group representing Conestoga Wood Specialties. “The cost of religious freedom for the Hahn family, which owns Conestoga Wood Specialties, is the same as the cost to many other job creators across the country who face this mandate: the potential for massive fines that would cripple their businesses and threaten jobs. For this reason, we will be asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review this case.” ####  ##### Should the Supreme Court decline to grant Conestoga's request for a hearing, the case would revert back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where a judge has yet to rule on the actual merits of allegations that the health care reform law's contraceptive coverage requirement violates the company's individual owners' rights to exercise their Christian beliefs, which forbid them to use or provide contraceptive drugs. #### "
"Kodak emerges from bankruptcy with pension plans intact","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits"," ##### When Eastman Kodak Co. emerged last week from its 20-month stay in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it did so with its pension plans intact, a move that is drawing praise from the federal agency that likely would have taken over the plans had Kodak moved to terminate them. ####  ##### “There have been times — far too many — when companies have entered bankruptcy and tried to unnecessarily shed their plans. Not Kodak. The company said they wanted to keep their plans going from the start and we applaud them for doing so,” the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. said in a statement Monday. ####  ##### The PBGC noted that it served on a committee of Kodak unsecured creditors and worked with the Rochester, N.Y.-based company to ensure the plans, which have about 63,000 participants, would continue. ####  ##### By keeping its pension plans, Kodak took a different path compared to some other big organizations, such as United Airlines Inc. and US Airways Group Inc., that filed for bankruptcy and said they could not afford to maintain their pension plans, with the PBGC later taking over the obligation to pay promised benefits to participants. ####  ##### Unlike those two airlines, whose pension plans were massively underfunded, Kodak’s plans have been relatively well-funded. ####  ##### At the end of the 2012, its U.S. pension plans were about 87% funded, with assets of $4.85 billion and $5.58 billion in liabilities, according to Kodak’s 2012 10-K report. ####  ##### With the rise since then in interest rates, which lowers the value of pension plan liabilities, and gains in the equities markets, the funding levels of Kodak’s plans likely are higher today. ####  ##### A Kodak spokesman said the company was “gratified” with the PBGC comments and will let those comments “speak for themselves.” #### "

Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Domino's Pizza Inc. and Greer, S.C.-based Ovation Brands, as well as Buck Consultants' parent company, Norwalk, Conn.-based Xerox Corp. ####  ##### In all, Buck said Wednesday, 400,000 employees and dependents will receive coverage through its exchange, RightOpt, which is available to employers with at least 3,000 employees. ####  ##### The exchange “provided Bob Evans Farms with an opportunity to more cost-effectively deliver a competitive employer-sponsored benefit program while providing expanded plan options and resources to our employees,” Pam Kuryla, the restaurant chain's vice president of total rewards, said in a statement. ####  ##### In all, the exchange offers seven health plan designs from 15 insurers, including Aetna Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna Corp. and Kaiser Permanente. ####  ##### The design of private insurance exchanges offered by Buck and others, which also are growing rapidly, is appealing to employers and employees, experts say. ####  ##### Through the exchange model, employers agree to provide a fixed premium contribution, with employees paying more or less for their share of the premium depending on the level of coverage they choose. Through that approach, employers can cap what they pay for employee health care coverage. ####  ##### In addition, the employer role as a health care plan sponsor becomes more limited, with exchange insurers handling claims and the exchange operator negotiating premium rates with insurers and assisting employees with questions. #### "
"U.S. Chamber looks to fix, not repeal, Obamacare","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accepted that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is here to stay and, rather than continue calling for its complete repeal, will work this year to change what it sees as flaws in the 2010 law, the business group's president and CEO said Wednesday. ####  ##### Outlining the chamber's 2014 priorities, Thomas Donohue, the group's president and CEO, sounded realistic about the statute that his organization had once wanted Congress to repeal and that Mr. Donohue said posed the single greatest threat to the future of American enterprise. ####  ##### “The administration is obviously committed to keeping the law in place, so the chamber has been working pragmatically to fix those parts of Obamacare that can be fixed — while doing everything we can to make regulations and mandates as manageable as possible for businesses,” Mr. Donohue said in his annual State of American Business address in Washington. “In 2014, we will work to repeal onerous health care taxes; repeal, delay or change the employer mandate; and give companies and their employees more flexibility in the choice of health insurance plans.” ####  ##### Mr. Donohue also highlighted the need for entitlement reform, as he has in this address in previous years. In 10 years, he noted, the cost for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will reach $3 trillion a year, while the share of the budget to pay for those programs — plus interest on the debt — will expand to 76% in 2023 from 65% last year. ####  ##### “Demographics are destiny and there's no way around it,” Mr. Donohue said. “Americans are living longer. Each and every day another 10,000 baby boomers retire — and that will add up to 77 million new retirees over the next 17 years.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In a news conference after his remarks, Mr. Donohue said he believes entitlement reform will not happen for a few more years. ####  ##### Katie Mahoney, executive director of health policy at the chamber, told Modern Healthcare that the chamber would like to see the Affordable Care Act's health insurance tax and medical device tax repealed, and it also will explore how the law's transitional reinsurance fee might be financed in a different way. ####  ##### Ms. Mahoney also said the chamber — which represents the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes in all sectors — would also like Congress to repeal the ACA's already-delayed employer mandate. But she acknowledged that in the current political environment, the chamber will take a pragmatic approach and will work to modify the mandate in a way that provides more certainty to businesses. ####  ##### “Under the statute, applicable large employers — those with 50 or more full-time equivalents — have to offer affordable minimum value coverage to full-time employees, full-time employees being those that work 30 hours or more hours a week,” Ms. Mahoney said. “Historically, full time has been defined as 40 hours a week, and we would like to see that definition be restored.” ####  ##### Another change would be to simplify the calculation that businesses must complete to determine if they are an applicable large employer. As Ms. Mahoney explained, that term is defined as an organization with 50 or more full-time employees, but how to determine that figure — which takes into account part-time hours, for instance — is often confusing for small businesses. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Ms. Mahoney echoed Mr. Donohue's approach to the law and offered the reasons why the chamber has laid to rest its efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. ####  ##### “The landscape's very different,” Ms. Mahoney said. “We've been through the Supreme Court decision, we've been through another election, and the president is going to be in office for another three years and this is his signature domestic policy,” she added. “So I think to say otherwise would be irrational.” ####  ##### Jessica Zigmond writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Corporate pension funding status rises to highest level since 2007","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management"," ##### The average funding ratio for the 100 largest U.S. corporate defined benefit plans jumped to 93.5% in 2013 — more than 10 percentage points higher than the previous two years and the highest since 2007, according to Pensions & Investments' annual analysis of corporate SEC filings. ####  ##### “I would not be surprised if the funding ratio exceeded 100% by the end of this year,” said Andrew Wozniak, the New York-based head of fiduciary solutions, in the investment strategy and solutions group of BNY Mellon Investment Management. ####  ##### The funding level was 108.6% in 2007, but plunged to 79.1% in 2008, the peak of the financial crisis.

However, Mr. Glickstein noted the relatively high discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities in 2013 were “still well below where rates were before the financial crisis.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The average discount rate rose to 4.82% in 2013 — higher than the 4.05% for 2012 but lower than the average of 6.4% used in 2008. ####  ##### “For years, people have expected rates to rise,” said Justin Owens, asset allocation strategist at Russell Investments in Seattle. “2013 was the year when interest rates finally rose.” ####  ##### Strong performance in equity markets also played a big part in the 2013 increase. The Russell 3000 index gained 33.6% in 2013, while the Standard & Poor's 500 returned 32.4%. International equities also showed higher returns in 2013, with the MSCI World index ex-U.S. returning 21.6%. ####  ##### Fixed income did not fare as well. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate index returned -2% in 2013, while the Barclays Global Aggregate ex-U.S. index returned -3.1%. ####  ##### The lower fixed-income returns in 2013 are not expected to cause a change in asset allocation strategies. “You just care about the stability of your plan's funding,” said Towers Watson's Mr. Glickstein. “Looking at it in the context of liability-driven (investing) or liability matching, you are less concerned with beating the market and more concerned with smoothing out volatility.” ####  ##### Aggregate assets of the top 100 plans increased to $1.16 trillion in 2013, a $53.9 billion increase from the previous year. ####  ##### “2013 was a fantastic year for plan sponsors of corporate defined benefit plans,” said BNY Mellon's Mr. Wozniak. “A strong equity market is the other half of the story.” ####  ##### In an environment of higher interest rates, lower plan liabilities and higher equity returns, 97 plans increased their funded status in 2013, while 24 plans had a funding surplus, four more than in the previous year. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The Allstate Corp., Northbrook, Ill., with $5.6 billion in defined benefit assets, had the highest jump in funded status, rising to a funding ratio of 105.8% in 2013 from 80.2% in 2012. In addition to a higher discount rate and a more favorable equity market, the company's 10-K filing also cited a $479 million increase in the pension prior service credit during 2013, which resulted from changes to the plan's benefit formula. ####  ##### The highest funding ratio — 163.8% — once again was held by NextEra Energy Inc., Juno Beach, Fla., with $3.69 billion in assets and $2.25 billion in liabilities. In 2012, Next-Era Energy's funding ratio was 142.7%. According to notes in the company's 10-K filing, NextEra Energy works to maintain its plan's funded status to minimize future company contributions. ####  ##### Mr. Wozniak of BNY Mellon sees maintaining a balance between assets and projected liabilities as a forward-looking strategy for corporate plan sponsors. “They would rather have the surplus cover that,” he said, “so they won't have to write a check in the future.” ####  ##### MeadWestvaco Corp., Richmond, Va., had the next highest funding ratio at 161.2%, up from 141.4% in 2012. The company used a 2013 discount rate of 4.82%, reducing liabilities to $2.4 billion from $3.03 billion the previous year. The company had defined benefit assets of $3.9 billion in 2013. ####  ##### The remaining three of the top five highest-funded plans were financial services companies. BB&T Corp., Winston-Salem, N.C., had a funding ratio of 153.2%, with $3.73 billion in assets and $2.43 billion in liabilities. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., New York had a funding ratio of 133.2%, with $14.35 billion in assets and $10.78 billion in liabilities, and Bank of America Corp., New York, had $18.28 billion in assets, $14.15 billion in liabilities and a funding ratio of 129.2%. ####  ##### Bank of America also had the second-highest increase in funded status, with a 25.2 percentage-point increase from 2012. Bank of America froze its defined benefit plans effective June 30, 2012, and the company's 10-K filing cited remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities after the freeze as a contributing factor to the funded status increase. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Sponsors will continue to shed liabilities — adding a lump sum, cashing out, fully or partially terminating the plan,” said Mr. Wozniak of BNY Mellon. ####  ##### When categorized by sector, financials had the highest average funding ratio — 107.1% — in 2013, with 14 companies in the sector. Next was health care, with an average funding ratio of 97.6% for eight plans. ####  ##### The highest funding ratio in the health-care sector belonged to Merck & Co. Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J. With $17.4 billion in assets and $16.06 billion in liabilities, Merck had a 21.6 percentage-point increase in funded status, rising to 108.6% in 2013 from 87% in 2012. ####  ##### Two airlines found themselves at the other end of the funding spectrum. Delta Air Lines Inc., Atlanta, had the dubious honor of sponsoring the worst-funded plan of the top 100 for the ninth consecutive year. Delta had a funded ratio of 46.9%, with plan assets of $8.9 billion and liabilities of $19.1 billion. Delta contributed $914 million to its plans in 2013. In 2012, Delta had a funded ratio of 38.1%. ####  ##### American Airlines Inc., Fort Worth, Texas, was third lowest on the list, with $10.06 billion in assets and $14.9 billion in liabilities for a funding ratio of 67.5% in 2013. American Airlines increased contributions to $494 million in 2013, which contributed to a $996 million reduction in plan liabilities. ####  ##### Decreased contributions were a noticeable trend among the top 100 companies in 2013, with contributions at the lowest level since the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. “We expect to see lower contributions,” said Bob Collie, chief research strategist, Americas institutional, at Russell Investments, Seattle. “It's interesting to look at the impact of funded status on contributions.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Although some companies made voluntary contributions above requirements, many followed a policy of contributing the minimum amount to gain tax advantages and comply with regulatory requirements. “In aggregate, this sample of very large plans is pulling back on contributions,” said Mr. Glickstein. ####  ##### The plans in P&I's universe made contributions of $31.7 billion in 2013, down from $47.4 billion in 2012. Five companies contributed $1 billion or more in 2013. ####  ##### Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., was the top contributor, putting $3.54 billion into its plans in 2013. With $41.22 billion in assets and $43.18 billion in liabilities, Ford's 2013 funded status was 95.4%. Ford reduced its liabilities by offering some participants a one-time choice to receive a lump-sum benefit settlement. According to its 10-K, Ford settled obligations of $3 billion in 2013 through the lump-sum offers, an option more plans might pursue as funding ratios rise. ####  ##### “The funding level has improved,” said Mark Ruloff, director of asset allocation at Towers Watson in Arlington, Va. “They are definitely more inclined to derisk, whether through an investment strategy move or a buyout.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Lockheed Martin Corp., Bethesda, Md., contributed $2.25 billion in 2013 to place second on the contribution list. The company had $33.01 billion in assets and $42.16 billion in liabilities in 2013 for a 78.3% funding ratio, 11.1 percentage points higher than in 2012. ####  ##### Boeing Co., Chicago, contributed $1.54 billion in 2013, reaching a funded status of 84.7%. Boeing had $58.13 billion in assets and $68.63 billion in liabilities. Boeing contributed more than $1.5 billion in 2013 but expects required contributions to be minimal in 2014. According its 10-K filing, the company plans discretionary contributions of about $750 million. ####  ##### Raytheon Co., Waltham, Mass., contributed $1.08 billion, with a funded status of 84.9%, $18.82 billion in assets and $22.16 billion in liabilities in 2013. With a funding ratio of 80.3%, a 19.6 percentage point increase from 60.7% in the previous year, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio, made $1.02 billion in contributions in 2013. ####  ##### The top 100 companies have announced contribution plans of $21.09 billion so far for 2014. According to annual filings, Ford, Exxon Mobil Corp., Goodyear Tire & Rubber, Verizon Communications Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp. expect to make contributions of more than $1 billion each. ####  ##### The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, which reduced required minimum contributions, will continue to have an impact in 2014. “It's still relevant,” said Mr. Wozniak. “Sponsors still have an option to defer some of the funding to future years. It gives them more flexibility.” ####  ##### Trilbe Wynne writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Employers join forces to oppose new PBGC premium hikes","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits"," ##### New hikes in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. premiums will have a negative economic impact, resulting in job losses and less money for business investment, according to a letter signed by dozens of employers and sent to federal lawmakers Tuesday. ####  ##### “Every additional dollar that employers must pay to the PBGC is one dollar less that can be used to fund participant benefits, expand their businesses, create jobs and grow the economy,” according to the letter signed by members of the Pension Coalition, a group of more than 100 employers, trade associations and professional organizations. ####  ##### “Increased costs associated with our pension program also means less flexibility for us to make investments that strengthen the competitiveness of our company and have a positive economic impact,” Etta Strong, director of compensation and benefits at Owens-Illinois Inc. in Perrysburg, Ohio, said in a statement. Owens-Illinois is a member of the Pension Coalition. ####  ##### The groups' letter comes amid worries by some business trade groups that federal lawmakers might attach a PBGC premium hike measure — or an administration proposal to transfer from Congress to the PBGC authority to set premium levels — to a broader bill. ####  ##### Congress last boosted PBGC premiums in December as part of a broader federal budget agreement. The PBGC flat-rate premium, which is paid by all defined benefit plan sponsors, will rise in 2015 to $57 per plan participant and to $64 in 2016. The premium now is $49 per plan participant. ####  ##### In addition, the variable-rate premium, which is paid by employers with underfunded plans, will increase to $24 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2015, up from $14 this year, and to $29 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2016. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### PBGC executives say the current premium system has to be changed. “We agree that PBGC premiums need to be reformed,” said PBGC Director Josh Gotbaum in a statement Wednesday. ####  ##### “It's important to understand that this administration and the previous one supported premium reforms. The President's proposal would allow PBGC's Board to both raise and lower premiums in a way that is fair, affordable, and preserves pensions,” he said. #### "
"Accenture puts private exchange enrollment at 3 million","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### Roughly 3 million individuals who obtain healthcare coverage through their employer enrolled through private exchanges for 2014 benefits, according to an analysis by consulting firm Accenture. ####  ##### That population is expected to swell to 40 million by 2018, or roughly a quarter of all individuals with employer-based coverage. ####  ##### Accenture's enrollment estimate for private exchanges in 2014 is far above previous calculations. In March, Moody's Investors Service Inc. estimated that fewer than 1 million active employees enrolled in coverage through a private exchange for 2014. And a forecast released last year by Accenture predicted that the private exchange population for this year would be 1 million individuals. ####  ##### Private exchanges mimic their public counterparts. They offer employees a wider array of coverage choices, often from competing insurers, than in traditional job-based benefit plans. The hope is that such marketplaces will reduce overall costs by allowing workers to choose plans that more accurately reflect their healthcare needs. Some of the largest private exchanges are operated by benefit management companies such as Aon Hewitt, Towers Watson & Co. and Mercer L.L.C. But many insurers have launched private exchange products as well. ####  ##### According to Richard Birhanzel, managing director of Accenture Health Administration Services, the 3 million figure was derived from scrutinizing reports by publicly traded companies and insights gleaned from working directly with insurers. Mr. Birhanzel attributes the rapid growth in enrollment in part to proselytizing efforts on the part of private exchange operators. But he also believes that there is organic interest from companies, particularly small to midsize employers. ####  ##### The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co. is one of the few large employers to embrace the private exchange model. Mr. Birhanzel argues that the 250,000-employee company's shift to a marketplace run by Aon Hewitt will encourage other large employers to make the change. “We haven't seen anybody else that's over 100,000 move yet, but we expect that that will happen this fall,” he said. ####  ##### Part of the allure for companies is that it allows them to shift from a defined benefit system to a defined contribution system. The change is similar to the transformation that's taken place with pensions in recent decades. It potentially allows companies to stabilize costs in an area that's been growing rapidly — premiums have gone up by 80% over the last decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation — but it also risks alienating employees if it merely shifts costs onto them. ####  ##### “Moving from defined benefit to defined contribution is a big part of this story,” Mr. Birhanzel said. “At a minimum they get to predictability.” ####  ##### The Accenture report also highlights risks that companies could face in adopting private exchanges. Most notably, they need to make sure employees have sufficient tools to make intelligent choices in the marketplace. Otherwise workers might end up with plans that don't meet their medical needs. ####  ##### Paul Demko writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Massachusetts repeals play-or-pay health care rules ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits"," ##### A Massachusetts health reform law board Thursday formally repealed regulations to a landmark state statute that required employers to either offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a fine. ####  ##### The unanimous vote by the board of directors of the Massachusetts Health Connector, which regulates key provisions of the state's 2006 health reform law, brings to a final end a provision in that law that required employers with at least 11 full-time employees to either offer coverage or pay an annual $295-per-employee fine. ####  ##### The catalyst for the board action was legislation Massachusetts lawmakers passed last year that formally repealed the mandate, known as the Employer Fair Share Contribution program. ####  ##### “Given the repeal of the underlying statutes, the Health Connector's accompanying regulations no longer have legal force. For these reasons, we are proposing to repeal the regulations to minimize any confusion about their legal effect,” stated a background paper prepared for Health Connector directors prior to the vote. ####  ##### Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick had sought repeal of the mandate, saying that it was no longer necessary to have such a requirement because of the subsequent passage of federal health care reform legislation. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and subsequent regulations, the federal employer mandate will go into effect in two stages. ####  ##### Next year, employers with at least 100 full-time employees will have to offer coverage to at least 70% of their full-time employees or pay an annual $2,000-per-employee penalty. In calculating the penalty, an employer can exclude 80 of its full-time employees in 2015. ####  ##### Then in 2016, the mandate will apply to employers with at least 50 full-time employees, with the 80-employee exclusion in calculating the penalty for not offering coverage permanently dropping to 30 employees. ####  ##### Aside from repealing the Fair Share contribution, the Massachusetts board also voted to repeal rules that required employers to provide access to so-called Section 125 plans to employees who work at least 64 hours a month. ####  ##### In a Section 125 plan, employees pay for health care premiums with pretax dollars. ####  ##### The requirement was intended to address situations in which employees not eligible for group coverage could use those pretax contributions to buy individual policies through Massachusetts' health insurance exchange. ####  ##### However, guidance issued in 2013 by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service made clear that the health care reform law, effective in 2014, bars employers from offering Section 125 plans to employees to purchase non-group health insurance without an employer contribution. ####  ##### In certain ways, the broader Massachusetts law was a model for the subsequent federal health care reform law, such as making state premium subsidies available to the lower-income uninsured to purchase coverage through a state health insurance exchange. ####  ##### Its 2006 law is a key reason Massachusetts has had over the last few years the lowest uninsured rate — 4.1%, in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau — of any U.S. state. #### "
"Lockheed to completely freeze pension plan by 2020","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. will completely freeze its defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees, completing a process it began in 2006. ####  ##### In the first step of a two-part plan, the amount of employees’ pay, used for pension benefit calculation purposes, will be frozen as of Jan. 1, 2016. ####  ##### Under the second step, employees’ credited service for pension benefit calculation purposes will be frozen as of Jan. 1, 2020. ####  ##### Affected employees, will, by 2020, receive an automatic company contribution equal to 6% of pay to a defined contribution plan. They also will be eligible for company matching contributions, up to 4% of pay. ####  ##### Lockheed’s actions follow an earlier step — effective in 2006 — in which new salaried employees no longer could participate in the defined benefit plan. ####  ##### Among other things, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed said in a statement that it was taking the action to better manage retirement plan costs at a more predictable rate and to limit long-term liabilities. ####  ##### Another factor, Lockheed said, was changing workforce demographics. “Since we closed the pension plan to new participants in 2006, we expect that by 2016, the majority of our employees will not be pension participants. Introducing a unified retirement program ensures that we’re offering consistent and competitive retirement benefits to the majority of Lockheed Martin salaried employees,” the company said ####  ##### About 48,000 of Lockheed Martin’s 113,000 employees participate in the pension plan. #### "
"U.S. appeals court rules for same-sex marriage in Oklahoma","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver has ruled in favor of same-sex couples seeking the right to legally marry in the state of Oklahoma. ####  ##### Echoing its previous decision to uphold a lower court's invalidation of Utah's constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in that state, a divided three-judge panel of 10th Circuit ruled 2-1 on Friday that a similar amendment to Oklahoma's constitution unfairly deprives gay and lesbian couples of marriage rights and benefits under state law. ####  ##### “Plaintiffs who wish to marry a partner of the same sex or have such marriages recognized seek to exercise a fundamental right, and state justifications for banning same-sex marriage that turn on the procreative potential of opposite-sex couples do not satisfy the narrow tailoring test applicable to laws that impinge upon fundamental liberties,” Judge Carlos Lucero wrote in the court's majority opinion, concluding that the state's ban violates gay and lesbian couples' rights to equal protection and due process under the U.S. Constitution. ####  ##### In addition to many of the same justifications for prohibiting same-sex marriage that the court previously rejected in the Utah case, Tulsa County Clerk Sally Howe Smith — the primary defendant in the lawsuit challenging Oklahoma's ban — argued that legalizing same-sex marriage would undermine the state's efforts to protect children by reducing the likelihood of their being raised by their biological parents. ####  ##### “Oklahoma has enacted numerous laws that result in children being raised by individuals other than their biological parents, and Oklahoma permits infertile opposite-sex couples to marry despite the fact that they, as much as same-sex couples, might raise non-biological children,” Judge Lucero said. “Yet Ms. Smith does not explain why same-sex marriage poses a unique threat such that it must be treated differently from these other circumstances.” ####  ##### “In summary, none of the arguments presented by Ms. Smith that were unaddressed in (the Utah case) persuade us to veer from our core holding that states may not, consistent with the United States Constitution, prohibit same-sex marriages,” Judge Lucero said. ####  ##### Thus far, the 10th Circuit is the only federal appeals court to rule on the legality of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage since the U.S. Supreme Court's June 2013 ruling in U.S. v. Windsor, which invalidated provisions of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage for federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman. ####  ##### Since the Supreme Court's ruling, state and federal judges in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky and Florida have struck down those states' bans on same-sex marriage in their entirety, while bans in Ohio and Tennessee have been partially overturned. ####  ##### Appeals to U.S. District Court rulings in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage in Virginia, Texas, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Nevada and Idaho are currently pending in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 9th circuits. #### "

"WellPoint medical cost ratio drives second-quarter profit beat","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, P/C Insurers, Wellpoint, Financial Results"," ##### (Reuters) — U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc. on Wednesday reported a decline in second-quarter profit, but its closely watched medical costs as a percentage of premiums ratio improved and it beat Wall Street estimates. ####  ##### WellPoint, which runs Anthem and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, is the third large health insurer to beat analysts' earnings estimates for the quarter, but shares have sold off as investors worried that a run in low medical costs might be ending. ####  ##### WellPoint beat Wall Street expectations because this ratio was less than foreseen, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note. ####  ##### ""The quarter should offer relief to nervous investors,"" Ms. Gupte said. ####  ##### WellPoint said it spent 82.7% of the premiums that it brought in on medical claims in what is known as the medical benefit expense ratio. That is down from 83.9% a year earlier. ####  ##### WellPoint said net income fell to $731 million, or $2.56 per share, from $800 million, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier. ####  ##### Excluding gains, it reported earnings of $2.44 per share. Analysts had been expecting $2.26. ####  ##### The decline in net income is partly due to a rise in sales, general and administrative expenses to 15.8% of operating revenue from 13.9% a year earlier because of new fees and continued spending due to health care reform. ####  ##### It raised its expectations for 2014 earnings by 20 cents to at least $8.60 per share. #### "

"Kodak bucks trend and enhances pension plan while eliminating 401(k) match","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Employers are expected to examine Eastman Kodak Co.'s counter-trend move to sweeten its defined benefit pension plan and eliminate its 401(k) plan match, but benefits experts don't expect the move to lead a significant revival of traditional defined benefit plans. ####  ##### Bucking a long-standing trend of employers freezing their pension plans, Kodak disclosed last month that it will enrich its 14-year-old cash balance plan. Effective Jan. 1, 2015 plan participants will earn an annual benefit equal to 7% of pay, a big improvement over the current benefit formula in which plan participants earn an amount equal to 4% of pay. ####  ##### Kodak also will move employees remaining in its traditional final average pay pension plan to the cash balance plan. At the time Kodak set up the cash balance plan in 1999, employees were given the choice of remaining in it or shifting to the cash balance plan. ####  ##### On the other hand, starting next year, Kodak will stop making matching employee contributions to its 401(k) plan. Currently, Kodak fully matches employees' contributions up to 1% of pay, then matches 50% of employees' salary deferrals up to the next 4% of pay. That match has been available only to cash balance plan participants, and not to employees covered by the traditional pension plan. ####  ##### Kodak's upcoming enhancement of its cash balance plan flies in the face of the biggest retirement trend of the last decade: the freezing of defined benefit plans by thousands of employers, such as Bank of America Corp., International Business Machines Corp., and Wells Fargo & Co., with many of them simultaneously bolstering their 401(k) plans. ####  ##### That widespread move away from defined benefit plans largely has been driven by corporate worries about their cost volatility, with factors such as fluctuating interest rates and volatility of equity markets, which are out of employers' control, having a huge effect on plan contributions. ####  ##### Jeff Clarke, CEO of Eastman Kodak, said in a letter to employees that through this change in retirement plan design “our pension benefit will be competitive with companies in our industry.'' ####  ##### Separately, in a statement, Kodak said it designs its benefit plans to balance “affordability with the ability to attract and retain talent. We believe our changes to the U.S. pension plan strike this balance and are competitive with the market.'' ####  ##### Still, no one predicts that a large number of employers will follow in Kodak's path. “The single biggest reason not to take this approach is risk,” said Art Noonan, a senior vice president with Mercer L.L.C. in Pittsburgh. ####  ##### With a defined benefit pension plan, Mr. Noonan said, employers can face unexpectedly high costs, such as when a slump in the equities market sends the value of plan assets plummeting and, with that, forces employers to funnel more money into the plan at a time when employers may be least able to afford it. ####  ##### “The problem with defined benefit plans is cost volatility,'' said Byron Beebe, U.S. retirement market leader with Aon Hewitt in Cleveland. “Plan sponsors have moved away from them because of the lack of cost predictability.'' ####  ##### By contrast, costs are highly predictable and controllable with 401(k) plans, in which employers agree to contribute a fixed amount, typically a set percentage of employees' pay, to their retirement plan accounts. Ups and downs in the equities markets, interest rates fluctuations or changing life expectancies have no bearing on what employers must contribute. ####  ##### But now, experts say, there is new — albeit modest — employer interest in holding on to and improving their defined benefit plans. “There are good and intelligent reasons for employers'' to consider this approach, said Kevin Wagner, a senior retirement consultant with Towers Watson & Co. in Southfield, Michigan. ####  ##### One factor driving employer interest is potentially lower retirement benefits costs. For example, Kodak estimated in a presentation to investors and analysts that its pension plan redesign will achieve annual savings of $12 million. ####  ##### Experts say such savings are possible because employers may be able to provide the same benefit at less cost in a cash balance plan than in a 401(k) plan. ####  ##### That is because employers, utilizing professional investment advisers, will likely reap greater investment results than employees do when they invest their employers' 401(k) plan contributions on their own. “You may be able to provide bigger benefits at less cost,” said Jack Abraham, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### There are other investment-related factors that could drive employer interest in retaining defined benefit plans and perhaps reducing the generosity of their 401(k) plans. ####  ##### One factor is that employees may not contribute enough to their 401(k) plans to give them the income they need to retire, forcing them to keep working longer than either they or their employers would like. ####  ##### “That is a looming problem,” said Nancy Tartaro, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### “We are entering the time period where some employers are saying, 'My workforce is not retiring as we were thinking and therefore we may reconsider' ” the retirement plan approach, Mr. Noonan said. ####  ##### On the other hand, some employees whom employers especially value may rack up hefty returns through their defined contribution plan investments and “may retire earlier than their employers want,” Ms. Tartaro said. #### "
"Congress faces pressure to resolve multiemployer pension woes","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits"," ##### When federal lawmakers passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974, they put aside a key issue affecting a big slice of the pension universe:  multiemployer plans. ####  ##### These 1,400 plans with about 10.4 million participants provide coverage to employees working for different companies and are members of trade unions. The plans are run by a joint board of union and employer representatives. When drafting ERISA, lawmakers punted on a crucial issue affecting employers contributing to the plans: What would be their financial obligations if they left underfunded plans? ####  ##### In 1980, Congress came up with the answer:  Employers leaving the plans would be liable for a share of the plans' unfunded liabilities.  That obligation — known as withdrawal liability — was a core part of a new law called the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act, which amended ERISA. ####  ##### Now, 34 years later, a movement is gaining traction in Congress to amend the multiemployer law, driven by fears that dozens of multiemployer pension plans may be in danger of collapse and guaranteeing the benefits to those plans' participants could itself swamp the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### Indeed, 175 multiemployer plans are in such financial trouble, the PBGC reported last year that it expects the plans to run out of assets and need money from the agency to pay participants' benefits. ####  ##### The agency has warned that the cost of paying the promised pensions would be nearly $10 billion, five times more than the federal agency has in its multiemployer pension plan insurance fund. Without changes in law and/or premium increases, the PBGC's insurance program “is more likely than not to run out of funds in eight years and highly likely to do so within 10 years,” the PBGC said in a summer report. ####  ##### A key part of many of the plans' problems is withdrawal liability, experts say. ####  ##### The amount of withdrawal liability can be so great that it has discouraged new employers from joining the multiemployer plans.  That, in turn, is creating a death spiral for plans as employer participants shrink when companies go out of business. ####  ##### “While many employers continue to withdraw from multiemployer plans, new employers have not been attracted to the plans to replace the leaving employers, mainly due to the unfavorable economics around the ultimate exit from the plan,” said Jack Abraham, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### “The path we are on will destroy the retirement security of families across the country,” U.S. Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said at a conference in June. ####  ##### But whether lawmakers will act anytime soon remains to be seen. #### "
"Landmark ERISA pension reform law sees mixed results 40 years after implementation","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Forty years after President Gerald Ford signed the first comprehensive pension reform bill into law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act has produced successes and failures. ####  ##### The impetus for the legislation President Ford signed on Labor Day 1974 came from the collapse of South Bend, Indiana-based Studebaker-Packard Corp. and the 1964 termination of its hourly pension plan covering members of the United Auto Workers union. ####  ##### When it was terminated, the plan only had enough assets to pay the 4,500 active vested participants about 15 cents for every dollar in pension benefits they had earned. ####  ##### The automaker's collapse was the start of a nationwide push to get pension reform through Congress, resulting in ERISA's first-time pension funding requirements, meaning companies could no longer promise benefits without putting any money aside to cover them. The law also created a federal pension insurance agency to provide additional protection for promised benefits. ####  ##### “Studebaker employees thought they had earned benefits, but they were not protected when the company failed,'' said Scott Macey, president of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington. “Today if you are promised a benefit, you are much more likely to get it. That is the overall success of ERISA.” ####  ##### Since then, thousands of underfunded pension plans have been terminated after their employer sponsors went out of business or were unable to make the required contributions. But ERISA's creation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. assured that billions of dollars in unfunded benefits are paid for participants in failed plans. In 2013, for example, the PBGC paid $5.4 billion in benefits to more than 800,000 retirees once enrolled in the nearly 4,600 plans the PBGC has taken over. ####  ##### “We cannot underestimate the good of the PBGC,” said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington. ####  ##### Besides protecting pension benefits, ERISA added security for employees' health care benefits. ####  ##### For example, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 that amended ERISA has been a boon to millions of employees and their dependents. It allows workers who lose their jobs to retain employer health care coverage for 18 months — and widowed, divorced or separated spouses for 36 months — by paying a premium equal to 102% of the employer group plan cost. ####  ##### That COBRA safety net especially showed its value during the Great Recession of 2008-2009 when federal lawmakers passed legislation providing a 65% federal subsidy of COBRA premiums for displaced employees. That subsidy resulted in a doubling to 38% of the COBRA takeup rate for laid-off employees, compared with the months just prior to before the subsidy was available, according to an Aon Hewitt survey. ####  ##### Meanwhile, ERISA helped put an end to “the disappointed expectations of private-sector workers covered by pension plans,” said Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington. Perhaps the most significant pension benefit protection under ERISA is a requirement that plan participants earn a nonforfeitable pension after a certain number of years. ####  ##### Before ERISA, as many as half of employer pension plans required at least 15 years of service to earn a benefit, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ERISA set several vesting schedules, including what became the most popular one in which participants became first and fully vested after 10 years of service. A later law, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, shortened the requirement to five years. ####  ##### The more rapid vesting has produced “clear economic value for tens of millions of workers,” said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. ####  ##### Indeed, ERISA and subsequent laws have solved the vesting issue so well that few today “even remember there was once a problem,” said Frank Cummings, a Washington pension attorney, who as a congressional staffer helped draft versions of the legislation that later became ERISA. ####  ##### However, ERISA has been ill-equipped to deal with the biggest recent pension problem: the erosion of defined benefit plans. ####  ##### As recently as 1998, 90% of Fortune 100 companies offered defined benefit plans to new salaried employees. Last year, just 30% did, according to Towers Watson & Co. And the decline in employer-sponsored defined benefit plans isn't limited to corporate giants. Last year, a little more than 23,000 employer plans were covered by the PBGC's insurance program, barely one-fifth of the plans covered in 1985. ####  ##### “Defined benefit plans are moribund. No one is starting a new plan,” while many existing plans are being frozen, Mr. Cummings said. ####  ##### Several reasons caused the fall of defined benefit plans, many of which have little to do with ERISA or later congressional initiatives, experts say. ####  ##### “With the younger generations, they recognized that their careers weren't going to be with one or two companies, but would likely be with 10 or 12,” said Joseph Molloy, vice president of managed care benefits and direct contracting at North Shore LIJ Health System in Great Neck, New York. ####  ##### Defined benefit plans, especially final average play plans in which benefits are tied to employees' salaries during their last years of service, appealed less to a more mobile workforce and employers. ####  ##### Cash balance plans became the fastest growing defined benefit plan of the late 1980s and early 1990, their popularity stemming from a more rapid benefit accrual and an easy-to-understand benefit formula. But numerous lawsuits challenged the basic design of cash balance plans as discriminatory against older employees. ####  ##### Many employers, tired of the regulatory and legal uncertainty, moved on to new approaches, often freezing defined benefit plans and enriching 401(k) plans. ####  ##### If passing the 2006 Pension Protection Act “had happened 15 years earlier, we would have had a much different outcome,” said Kevin Wagner, a senior Towers Watson & Co. retirement consultant in Southfield, Michigan. ####  ##### Although often thought of as a pension law, ERISA's legacy extends beyond pension plans. ####  ##### Indeed, a core ERISA provision — pre-emption of state laws that relate to employee benefit plans — has enabled employers operating in multiple states to offer health care plans with the same benefits to employees, regardless of the states those employees live. ####  ##### “You can have uniform benefits. This has made life so much easier for plan administrators,” said Marjorie Martin, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### “The challenge of complying with a jumble of multiple state health benefit mandate laws would have overwhelmed many employers,” said Amy Bergner, a managing director of human resources at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Washington. ####  ##### “Pre-emption is the crown jewel of ERISA,” said Mr. Klein of the American Benefits Council. ####  ##### To be sure, there have been legal challenges to ERISA pre-emption.  In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the legality of ERISA pre-emption. The justices, though, said that it applies only to self-insured plans and not to insured plans. ####  ##### Forty years after ERISA's passage, federal lawmakers do not have further changes to the statute under active consideration. ####  ##### Still, some lawmakers, as well as many in the private sector, say a 1980 law that amended ERISA to require employers leaving underfunded multiemployer plans to pay a share of the plans' promised, but unfunded benefits, needs to be revamped to prevent a collapse of a PBGC insurance program protecting participants' benefits. ####  ##### Another ERISA change employers say would be welcome would be to base, at least in part, PBGC employer premium rates on the financial health of plan sponsors. #### "
"Cincinnati to cover employee gender reassignment surgery","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Cincinnati will offer coverage for medically necessary transgender procedures under its employee health care plans beginning in 2015, according to city officials. ####  ##### Interim City Manager Scott Stiles last week authorized the city's group health insurer, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to add gender reassignment surgery to its scope of covered services under its active employee health plans, effective Jan. 1, 2015. ####  ##### Coverage for gender reassignment surgery will include a lifetime limit of $75,000 per covered individual. The lifetime limit does not include mental health services or hormone replacement services, which the city already covers, according to Mr. Stiles' Aug. 22 letter to Anthem authorizing the coverage expansion. ####  ##### The change to the city's group health benefit plans was made at the behest of a coalition of Cincinnati City Council members led by Chris Seelbach, the council's first openly gay member. ####  ##### Approximately 5% of U.S. cities and 46% of U.S.-based companies currently offer comprehensive transgender health care benefits, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign. #### "

"App developers seek clearer U.S. health data privacy guidelines","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### (Reuters) — Developers of apps for mobile devices are asking a U.S. agency to clarify its rules for protecting patient health information to reflect the fast-evolving technology. ####  ##### On Monday, a consortium of startups including CareSync, AirStrip and AngelMD, sent a letter to Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., to express their frustration at the lack of developer-friendly online resources surrounding the privacy rules known as HIPAA. Apps such as AirStrip are particularly concerned about security and privacy, as they provide data to doctors to help them make urgent care decisions. ####  ##### In the letter viewed by Reuters, the developers said they are struggling to compete with larger vendors that have the resources to hire lawyers and consultants. They say they must rely on government websites, which have not been updated recently. ####  ##### Regulators ""have not kept pace with the rapid growth of technology that gives users greater access to healthcare providers and more control over their health information,"" the letter said. ####  ##### This complaint comes at a time developers, lobbyists and policymakers are engaged in heated discussions about how to oversee the growing mobile health market. Earlier on Monday, representatives from various government agencies addressed how to manage health data at the annual Consumer Health IT Summit. ####  ##### Morgan Reed, executive director of the App Association, a group that claims to represent 5,000 mobile app companies, said startups and large tech companies alike, including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, are seeking clarity on how sensitive health data can be stored and shared. ####  ##### The App Association was among those that signed the letter to Rep. Marino. Mr. Reed said some developers are relying on information that was last updated in 2006, months before the release of the iPhone and other mobile devices. ####  ##### Developers also asked that the government provide better guidance about how health data can be stored in the cloud. In the letter, they request that the government provide a developer-friendly list of frequently asked questions and other documentation, and that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services increase its participation in mobile health events. ####  ##### Rep. Marino said he previously asked developers in the startup community to provide a list of specific grievances with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ####  ##### ""A company should not be forced to staff up with a dozen lawyers simply to ensure they are in compliance with the law,"" he said. ""Rather, the burden should be on a transparent and responsive government to provide clarity and guidance, so companies can focus on growing their businesses and providing better and more innovative products and services to the public."" ####  ##### A spokesman for HHS said the agency has posted information online about security requirements for mobile health tools. ####  ##### ""The goal is to make sure that health information, no matter what form, paper or electronic, is kept safe and secure,"" he said. #### "
"Newell Rubbermaid to offer lump-sum pension benefits to 5,700 participants","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Newell Rubbermaid Inc. will offer about 5,700 former vested employees not yet receiving pension benefits the opportunity to convert their future monthly annuity to a cash lump-sum benefit. ####  ##### “This will reduce the size of the company's U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation and related expenses,"" the Atlanta-based marketer of a wide range of consumer products, which include Paper Mate pens and Calphalon cookware, said in a filing Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### The cash payments made to those opting for lump sums will come from pension plan assets and will not affect corporate cash flow, the company said. ####  ##### At the end of last year, Newell Rubbermaid's U.S. pension plans were underfunded with $829.5 million in assets and $1.03 billion in liabilities, according to the company's 2013 10-K report. #### "
"American Axle to offer lump-sum pension payments to 6,000 former employees","Benefits Management","Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Auto parts manufacturer American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. says it will offer up to about 6,000 former employees the opportunity to convert their monthly annuity benefit to a cash lump sum benefit. ####  ##### “We expect that the lump-sum settlements, which will be paid from plan assets, will reduce our liabilities and administrative costs,” the Detroit-based company said in a filing Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### The offer will be available from Oct. 2 through Nov. 14, American Axle said in the filing. ####  ##### At year-end 2013, American Axle's pension plans were underfunded by $42 million, with $755.4 million in benefit liabilities and $713.4 million in assets, according to the company's 2013 10-K report. The plans have about 14,000 participants. ####  ##### When pension plan participants take lump-sum benefits and are no longer covered by the plan, their former employers do not have to worry about how interest rate fluctuations and investment results could affect how much they will have to contribute to their pension plans to fund future annuity payments. ####  ##### In addition, when participants take lump sums and move out of the pension plan, employers can reduce certain fixed costs, such as the payment of sharply rising premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. #### "
"Anthem, LA providers creating HMO to compete with Kaiser ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### An unusual joint venture between Anthem Blue Cross and seven competing Los Angeles-area hospital systems to offer employers a low-priced HMO plan underscores the eagerness of insurers and providers to try novel and risky strategies to survive in the rapidly changing healthcare marketplace. ####  ##### The new company — Anthem Blue Cross Vivity — will seek to replicate Kaiser Permanente's success in controlling costs and ensuring quality — but without the singular ownership Kaiser has over its insurance and provider arms. To do so, participants in the joint venture agreed to share equally in profits and losses. ####  ##### Starting next month, the venture will market a new health plan to employers with no deductible and premiums 10% below competitors, according to Anthem Blue Cross, a division of publicly traded insurer WellPoint. Patients who select the plan will be limited to a select network of providers, which includes 6,000 doctors and 14 hospitals. The California Public Employees' Retirement System has agreed to include the Vivity network in its HMO plan. ####  ##### Regional markets are seeing a wave of mergers, partnerships and creative arrangements like Vivity. These alliances are producing networks that compete head to head with each other and could transform markets along the lines envisioned by healthcare reform architects. The deals linking local competitors — such as the Vivity joint venture and a merger earlier this month in Chicago — are uniting historically separate sectors including hospitals, insurers, physician groups and post-acute care providers. ####  ##### Last week, St. Louis-based Ascension Health announced it would launch a post-acute care joint venture with a publicly traded partner. This month, Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University Health System said the two would merge to create a mega-system in Chicago. ####  ##### Deals have exploded under growing public and private pressure to control health spending growth, with resulting downward pressure on government and private insurance payment rates. Dealmakers say new combinations will reduce waste and lower cost while better coordinating care. But with the flurry of deals comes heightened antitrust concerns about reduced competition and resulting higher prices. ####  ##### On the other hand, the new combinations are designed to boost competition and lower prices in markets such as Los Angeles which traditionally featured relatively robust competition among major insurers but not providers. Vivity seeks to compete head-to-head with Kaiser — the Oakland-based integrated delivery system that holds the largest share of the California employer market — as well as Health Net and Blue Shield of California, which also offer HMO and other narrow-network products. ####  ##### “When it comes to healthcare cost control, if the market is going to solve our problems, it has to be through competing systems,” said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an architect of the healthcare reform law. The Vivity initiative indicates that healthcare prices have “reached the breaking point,” Gruber said. ####  ##### But hospital systems risk dangerously eroding margins in models that seek to reduce inpatient care, especially in a period where the fee-for-service payment model, which rewards greater volume, still holds powerful sway. ####  ##### Some dealmakers are betting that investment in care coordination and health IT can yield enough savings to make money under the new value-based payment models. But the evidence so far is mixed. The CMS said last week that three-quarters of roughly 200 Medicare accountable care organizations have failed to meet cost targets and earn bonuses through the first two years of the ACO demonstration. ####  ##### The new Vivity joint venture raises the stakes by betting that seven competing hospital systems — some of which are among the higher-cost systems in the market — can work jointly to reduce costs and improve quality. It will market an HMO to large, fully insured employers in Los Angeles and Orange counties, with an anticipated first-year enrollment of 15,000. It has said it will hold premiums 10% below current rates. Employers will pay a capitated payment for each enrollee. There will be no deductibles or coinsurance, and copayments for medical services will be modest. ####  ##### Vivity’s partners will pool premiums into one budget. Partners share equally in profits and losses. Partners that fail to meet quality targets won’t earn profits. ####  ##### Together with Anthem, Vivity’s provider partners — Cedars-Sinai Health System, Good Samaritan Hospital and UCLA Health, all in Los Angeles; Huntington Memorial Hospital, Pasadena; MemorialCare Health System, Fountain Valley; PIH Health, Whittier; and Torrance (Calif.) Memorial Medical Center — will move to meld their health IT systems, at first relying on Anthem’s claims data system. Anthem indicated it would expand the model to other markets and other states if it succeeds. ####  ##### Executives involved with the deal acknowledge the venture’s ambition and uncertainty. “The delivery systems themselves now have made a commitment and they’re trying to project where this will take them over time,” said Joseph Swedish, CEO of Anthem’s parent company, WellPoint. “But there are still, admittedly, many unknowns.” ####  ##### Vivity is among a wave of mergers and creative arrangements producing networks of historically independent players. These alliances could transform markets along the competitive lines envisioned by healthcare reform architects. ####  ##### “We’ve all done this before, we just haven’t done this together,” said Craig Leach, president and CEO of Torrance Memorial Health System. ####  ##### Vivity will offer CalPERS’ 210,000 members in Los Angeles and Orange counties access to health systems “that frankly, from a price perspective, would not have been available” without adding $100 per month to premiums otherwise, said Ann Boynton, deputy executive officer for benefit programs, policy and planning at CalPERS. ####  ##### Nonetheless, Vivity’s success likely will depend on targeting the high-cost care delivered in hospitals, something which can threaten hospital margins. Providers said existing capitation in California’s market has spurred many cost-saving transformations that prepare them to benefit under the Vivity HMO. ####  ##### “That is a pretty bold play,” said Leemore Dafny, former deputy director for healthcare and antitrust with the Federal Trade Commission and professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “It’s not obvious how they’re going to reduce hospital occupancy and come out on top.” ####  ##### Vivity executives said reduced spending will come through special negotiated rates for hospital care and efforts to more closely manage where patients get care. “Prices are irrelevant in this conversation,” said Stephen Ralph, CEO of Huntington Memorial Hospital. ####  ##### Thomas Priselac, CEO for the Cedars-Sinai Health System, and Dr. David Feinberg, president of UCLA Health, were unavailable for comment. ####  ##### Pam Kehaly, president of Anthem Blue Cross’ West Region, said Vivity partners will have many consolidation opportunities for reducing costs, such as operating a single nurse-call center for members. It also will be critical to direct patients to the most cost-effective setting across Vivity’s network of ambulatory-care centers, community hospitals and academic medical centers. ####  ##### That ability to manage across lower- and high-cost settings will be critical to academic centers’ success in this and other accountable care initiatives. “The idea is to provide the right care in the least restrictive setting,” said Dr. Scott Berkowitz, medical director of accountable care for Johns Hopkins Medicine and executive director of its ACO. ####  ##### But to manage that care, the partners will have to overcome many organizational and cultural differences. “There are seven different ways of doing things” among the systems involved, said Steve Valentine, president of the Camden Group, a Los Angeles consulting firm. ####  ##### Melanie Evans writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Honeywell latest firm to draw EEOC scrutiny over wellness program penalties","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices"," ##### Honeywell International Inc. on Wednesday called the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's recent lawsuit against the company over plans to penalize workers who refuse to participate in its workplace wellness program “frivolous” and “out of step.” ####  ##### The Morristown, N.J.-based multinational company informed employees at its facilities in Minnesota earlier this year that non-participation in wellness-related biometric screenings would result in a $500 annual surcharge on their 2015 health insurance premiums, the EEOC claims in a lawsuit filed Monday in a Minneapolis federal District Court. ####  ##### The lawsuit claims Honeywell also planned to withhold contributions to employees' tax-preferred health savings accounts worth up to $1,500 annually and assess an additional $1,000 tobacco surcharge against employees who refused to submit to the wellness screenings, which include tests for their blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and body mass. ####  ##### Similar penalties would also be assessed against employees' spouses enrolled in Honeywell's group health insurance plan if they refused to participate in the biometric tests, the EEOC said in its lawsuit. ####  ##### The agency's lawsuit accuses Honeywell of violating both the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act by effectively forcing employees and their spouses to submit to the health screenings, and seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the company from implementing the penalties. ####  ##### In a statement released on Wednesday, Honeywell said the wellness incentives attached to the biometric screening program comply with provisions of both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, “which were designed by Congress to encourage healthier lifestyles while helping to control healthcare costs.” ####  ##### “(The EEOC) is unfamiliar with the details of our wellness programs and woefully out of step with the healthcare marketplace and with the core intent of the Affordable Care Act to provide expanded access and improved healthcare to all Americans,” the company said in its statement. “No Honeywell employee has ever been denied healthcare coverage or disciplined in any way as a result of their voluntary decision not to participate in our wellness programs.” ####  ##### Honeywell added in its statement that its intent was to reward employees who do participate in the screenings by lowering their monthly premiums. ####  ##### “For employees with single coverage who voluntarily decide to take a biometric screening, their monthly premiums will be $125 lower than the employees who decide not to take a biometric screening,” the company's statement said. “Biometric results are strictly confidential and not shared with the Company.” ####  ##### The lawsuit against Honeywell is the third such action taken by the EEOC this year targeting employers whose workplace wellness programs exceed the agency's informal threshold of voluntary participation on the part of individual employees. Similar federal lawsuits were recently filed against a pair of Wisconsin-based employers, Orion Energy Systems Inc. and Flambeau Inc. ####  ##### Reacting to the news of the EEOC's lawsuit against Honeywell on Wednesday, employer advocacy groups criticized the agency for taking legal action against employers without first issuing formal guidance on its treatment of incentivized workplace wellness programs under the federal nondiscrimination statutes it enforces, including the ADA and GINA. ####  ##### “Employers have been seeking guidance for years from the EEOC regarding how the ADA and GINA apply to wellness programs, and it has failed to provide that guidance,” Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the Washington D.C.-based National Business Group on Health, said in an interview with Business Insurance. “Now they're coming out with legal action that basically conflicts with both the Affordable Care Act and HIPAA.” ####  ##### Gretchen Young, senior vice president for health policy at the Washington, D.C.-based ERISA Industry Committee, said in a statement that the EEOC appeared to be playing by “a different set of rules, with no forewarning to companies whatsoever.” ####  ##### “Even though large American companies have invested a huge amount of time, money, and manpower into making sure that their wellness programs comply with the ACA, now here comes the EEOC out of left field with a whole new set of rules and regulations to impose on these programs,” Ms. Young said. #### "

In 2016, the 100-employee threshold for the so-called employer mandate drops to 50 employees and remains at that level in succeeding years. ####  ##### Under the legislation, H.R. 22, introduced by Rep.

"More employers move pre-Medicare retirees to exchanges, high-deductible plans","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, P/C Insurers, Retirement Benefits, Towers Watson"," ##### Employers are considering a variety of approaches to better control the cost of health care coverage to pre-Medicare eligible retirees — including shifting to high-deductible plans and moving to private or public insurance exchanges, according to a survey released Tuesday. ####  ##### For example, 42% of employers surveyed by benefit consultant Towers Watson & Co. say they currently offer the early retirees a high-deductible health care plan linked to health savings accounts, with another 8% saying they are considering adopting such a design in 2016 or 2017. ####  ##### In addition, 45% of employers said they have placed a dollar cap on how much they will contribute toward the cost of coverage. ####  ##### Employers also are growing more confident that public exchanges— authorized by the health care reform law— could be a viable alternative to directly providing coverage to pre-Medicare eligible retirees. ####  ##### While only 8% of surveyed employers now have confidence in the public exchange approach, 35% are sanguine that the approach will be viable by 2017. ####  ##### In fact, in some cases, pre-Medicare eligible retirees could be better off when obtaining coverage through a public exchange. That is because lower-income, pre-Medicare eligible retirees — those earning less than 400% of the federal poverty level, which comes to $46,680 for an individual or $95,400 for a family of four — are eligible for federal premium subsidies to use to buy coverage in public exchanges. ####  ##### In fact, in one widely-discussed approach, employers can terminate their early retiree health plans and establish and contribute to health reimbursement arrangements for retirees. ####  ##### Retirees then have a choice: tap the HRA to pay health insurance premiums purchased through a public exchange or, particularly for lower-income retirees, skip the HRA contribution in favor of a likely larger federal premium subsidy to buy coverage. Alternatively, employers might also make a private insurance exchange available, with the retirees using the HRA contribution to obtain coverage through those exchanges. ####  ##### The Towers Watson survey is based on the responses of 144 employers. ####  ##### “Pre-65 retiree medical plan sponsors have been eagerly awaiting options to deliver value to their early retirees,” Trevis Parson, Towers Watson's chief health actuary in Philadelphia said in a statement. #### "
"Timken to buy Prudential annuity for pension benefits","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### North Canton, Ohio-based bearings and power transmissions manufacturer The Timken Co. said it is buying a group annuity to provide pension benefits to about 5,000 retirees and their beneficiaries. ####  ##### In the latest corporate move to reduce pension liability risks, Timken said Thursday that it will transfer about $600 million in pension plan obligations to Prudential Insurance Co. of America by purchasing the group annuity. ####  ##### The agreement covers about 5,000 U.S. retirees, or their survivors, who began receiving pension benefits prior to April 1, 2014. The liability transfer to Prudential is expected in April, Timken said. ####  ##### The deal will “reduce risk and protect participant benefits going forward,” Timken said in a statement. ####  ##### The purchase will be funded by pension plan assets and will not require cash contributions from the company, Timken said. ####  ##### At the end of 2013, Timken's pension plans were slightly overfunded with $3.3 billion in assets and $3.1 billion in liabilities, according to its 10-K report. ####  ##### Timken's move followed announcements last fall by Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola Solutions Inc. that it would shift about $3 billion in pension plan obligations for some 30,000 retirees through buying a group annuity from Prudential; and by New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which purchased a group annuity from Prudential to shift about $1.4 billion in pension obligations to the insurer. ####  ##### In 2012, General Motors Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. also signed multibillion-dollar pension buyout deals with Prudential. ####  ##### Benefit experts say more employers are expected to take such actions, which transfer the benefit obligations to an insurer, eliminate their exposure to fluctuating interest rates, save on premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., as well as save on costs associated with offering and administering their pension plans. ####  ##### “Companies are looking for ways to achieve contribution certainty and eliminate funding volatility so they can put greater focus on their core business and still meet their obligations to their plan participants and retirees,” said Susan Cannilla, a vice president with Prudential Retirement's pension and structured solutions business in Woodbridge, New Jersey. #### "

"CVS warns new cholesterol drugs could break the health care bank","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, CVS Caremark, Health Care Costs"," ##### (Reuters) — CVS Health on Monday warned that costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments and other specialty drugs in development could eclipse those of expensive new medicines and overwhelm the health care system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” ####  ##### CVS, the second largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager which negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans, noted that two of the new injectable cholesterol fighters — called PCSK9 inhibitors — could be approved by mid-2015 and likely each cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year. ####  ##### All told, PCSK9 inhibitors could eventually cost the healthcare system as much as $150 billion a year and become the highest-selling class of drugs in history, CVS said. ####  ##### “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. ####  ##### The company added that the sky-high prices of the new cholesterol drugs could pave the way for other very costly specialty drugs. ####  ##### CVS' call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians of the high costs of recently approved oral treatments for hepatitis C, especially two brands from Gilead Science Inc. that have retail prices of up to $94,500. ####  ##### Those drugs wipe out the liver virus in more than 90% of patients and don't need to be used beyond 12 weeks for most patients. By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed “for the duration of patients' lives” and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans. ####  ##### Amgen Inc. and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol — a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used for those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc.'s Lipitor. ####  ##### The experimental treatments, in combination with statins, knocked down their levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by as much as 60% more than statins alone. ####  ##### Gilead's Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another of its anti-viral medicines into a daily pill, won U.S. approval late last year and has a retail price of $94,500. By itself, Sovaldi's list price is $84,000 per treatment. ####  ##### Gilead has acknowledged negotiating price discounts with payers of more than 40% for the two hepatitis C brands, as it vies for market share with a newer rival therapy from AbbVie called Viekira Pak. ####  ##### Shares of Amgen were up 0.8% on Tuesday on the Nasdaq, while Regeneron's stock gained 2.2%.

"California pension reform measure to target CalPERS","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits"," ##### (Reuters) — A ballot measure campaign to cut California's public pensions will be launched in May by a coalition of politicians and business people led by former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, with the state's largest retirement system a prime target. ####  ##### The measure would take aim at California's $300 billion giant CalPERS, which has a near-iron grip on the state's pensions. CalPERS, America's largest public pension fund and administrator of pensions for more than 3,000 state and local agencies, has long argued that pensions cannot be touched or renegotiated, even in bankruptcy. ####  ##### ""CalPERS has dedicated itself to preserving the status quo and making it difficult for anybody to reform pensions,"" Mr. Reed said in an interview. ""This is one way to take on CalPERS and, yes, CalPERS will push back."" ####  ##### CalPERS spokeswoman Rosanna Westmoreland said: ""Pensions are an integral part of deferred compensation for public employees and a valuable recruitment and retention tool for employers."" ####  ##### The measure will be closely watched by reformers and their union opponents in other states in an ongoing national battle between those who say public pensions are putting intolerable strains on budgets and those who argue pension cuts unfairly penalize retirees and workers. ####  ##### For most California cities, their largest debt is pension liability, a significant factor in the recent bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino. CalPERS has said it will increase pension contributions for most cities by up to 50% in the coming years. ####  ##### Mr. Reed, a Democrat, abandoned a similar statewide ballot initiative in 2014, claiming that Kamala Harris, California's Democratic attorney general, had approved wording of the initiative that was biased and union-friendly. ####  ##### But he vowed to fight on after leaving office in December, and in an interview with Reuters confirmed for the first time the launch of the initiative and its timing, while noting that a major motive was to challenge CalPERS' grip. ####  ##### Mr. Reed says the push will seek to place a simpler, more legally watertight pension reform measure on California's November 2016 ballot, giving mayors and other local government executives the authority to renegotiate contracts. ####  ##### To win a place on the 2016 ballot, backers of the initiative will have to obtain the signatures of 585,000 registered voters, or 8% of the number of voters in California's last gubernatorial election, in this case 2014. ####  ##### Mr. Reed and his allies have been huddling with legal advisers for months to devise a voter initiative that is simpler and less vulnerable to court challenges than last year's effort. ####  ##### They have also been buoyed by a ruling in the recent municipal bankruptcy of Stockton, whose judge said California's public pensions are not inviolate. ####  ##### As San Jose mayor, Mr. Reed helped pass a pension reform measure for his city, parts of which have been struck down after union lawsuits. ####  ##### Mr. Reed is working with other pension reform advocates, including former San Diego Republican council member Carl DeMaio, the primary backer of a pension reform initiative in San Diego that was approved by voters in 2012; and the Ventura County Taxpayers Association's David Grau. ####  ##### ""We have done a lot of legal work to make sure this initiative is bulletproof,"" Mr. DeMaio said. ""Because the unions are going to throw the kitchen sink at us."" ####  ##### The group is talking to potential financial backers, Mr. Reed said. Last year, Mr. Reed took $200,000 from a group funded by Texas hedge fund billionaire John Arnold and they could partner again this time round, he said. ####  ##### Karol Denniston, a public finance attorney and pension expert at Squire Patton Boggs in San Francisco, said voters should be working for legal change to provide more options than municipal bankruptcy: ""Right now CalPERS has no program for financially distressed cities,"" Ms. Denniston said. ####  ##### Dave Low, executive director of the California School Employees Association, said the group would campaign to defeat the measure and was ""confident we can defeat it."" #### "

Atwood, executive director of the Chicago-based ISBI, which also oversees the investment of $15.1 billion in defined benefit assets. ####  ##### “We're trying to get the plan consistent with best practices because we have an outsized allocation (23.3% of total fund assets) to small-cap growth,” Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### The huge allocation to the Columbia Acorn Z mutual fund is a result of the longevity of the relationship, Mr. Atwood said. The fund has been in the plan's investment lineup for more than 30 years, many of which produced terrific performance. ####  ##### “Small-cap growth is a highly volatile asset class, but it can produce outsize returns on an absolute and relative basis,” Mr. Atwood said. “Acorn had done a good job, but the portfolio has changed over time,” as have the portfolio managers. ####  ##### Unusual move ####  ##### The re-enrollment, which is required of all participants and begins this month, is an unusual move for defined contribution plans, especially for public plans, consultants and researchers say. ####  ##### “It's a best practice (but whether to do it) depends on the makeup of the fund,” such as in terms of lack of diversity of participant allocations, said Brian Wrubel, president and CEO of Marquette Associates Inc., Chicago, the ISBI's investment consultant. ####  ##### Re-enrollments are designed “to steer (participants) into risk-appropriate funds,” Mr. Wrubel said. ####  ##### Keith Brainard, Georgetown, Texas-based research director, National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he hasn't run across any other public DC plans that have conducted auto re-enrollments. ####  ##### On the corporate side, the number of auto re-enrollments is small, but is “a number that is growing,” said Alison Borland, senior vice president of retirement strategy and solutions, Aon Hewitt, Lincolnshire, Illinois. ####  ##### Jacob O'Shaughnessy, adviser, Arnerich Massena Inc., a Portland, Oregon-based investment consulting firm, said such re-enrollments are rare, although more common among corporate defined contribution plans than public plans. ####  ##### But re-enrollment is ”more on the horizon for governmental programs” as executives there look more at outcomes as a result, in some cases, of diminished benefits, and at corporate best practices for guidance, Mr. O'Shaughnessy said. ####  ##### As part of the re-enrollment, ISBI is dropping the Columbia Acorn Z mutual fund, the plan's most popular investment option, for reasons of performance and portfolio characteristics, said Mr. Atwood. He said the portfolio, with $953 million in ISBI assets, “migrated away from a conventional small-cap (growth) fund” as ISBI classified it for participants. ####  ##### In all, 49% of the 457 plan's participants have some assets in the Acorn fund, Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### The Acorn fund is actively managed by Columbia Wanger Asset Management L.L.C., Chicago. It invests in U.S. small- and midcap growth companies, according to a Columbia year-end 2014 report. The fund returned 0.8% in 2014, underperforming the 5.6% return of its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth index, according to a report to the ISBI from Marquette. The fund also underperformed the benchmark for three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31, the report said. ####  ##### Carlos Melville, Columbia spokesman, declined to comment. ####  ##### ISBI is replacing the Columbia fund with the Franklin Small Cap Group Fund R6, managed by Franklin Templeton (BEN) Investments (BEN). Mr. Atwood estimates the Franklin fund will get a total $150 million of participant allocations, much less than the Columbia Acorn allocation, mainly because many participants driven to target-date funds in the re-enrollment will remain in them. ####  ##### As part of the re-enrollment, ISBI officials are changing the default option to T. Rowe Price Retirement Active Trusts target-date funds from a stable value fund managed by Invesco (IVZ) Advisers Inc., Atlanta. The stable value fund will remain an option. ####  ##### “Defaulting to a lifestyle option is considered best practices as defined by the Department of Labor,” Mr. Atwood said, noting ISBI officials look to the DOL for guidance even though the Illinois plan isn't regulated by the department. ####  ##### Now, the plan has 17 options, managed by 10 managers, and 12 T. Rowe Price target-date funds. After the changes, the plan will have 16 options, managed by 10 managers, and 13 T. Rowe Price target-date funds. ####  ##### Dropped will be an active small-cap value fund managed by Northern Trust Asset Management, Chicago, which has $46 million in assets. With the anticipated decline in assets from the re-enrollment, the fund couldn't qualify for the lower separate account fee, which is 0.6%compared to an industry average 0.97%. ####  ##### The re-enrollment will transform the aggregate allocation, Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### The current allocation is 47.7% total in eight U.S. equity funds, 20.5% in the stable value fund, 11.9% in 11 target date funds, 9% in the Fidelity Puritan balanced fund, 5.3% in two fixed-income funds, 3.5% in three non-U.S. equity funds and 2.1% in the Vanguard prime money market fund. ####  ##### Officials at Marquette and Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services, the plan's record keeper, estimate 80% to 85% of plan participants will default to the target-date funds and stay in them, Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### Cautious ####  ##### Mr. Brainard was cautious about enthusiasm for re-enrollments. ####  ##### “All the participants (in the public defined contribution plan) presumably already have a (defined benefit) pension plan so the 457 is a supplemental retirement savings vehicle,” Mr. Brainard said. “The pension plan is a secure source of guaranteed income in retirement (so) ... participants should and could take more risk in the 457” plan. ####  ##### “Presumably plan participants have made a decision on how they want their assets invested,” Mr. Brainard said. “The plan sponsor is substituting its judgment.” ####  ##### Mr. Atwood responded: “One could argue that persons who participate in a defined benefit plan could afford to take more risk in a defined contribution plan. We aren't arguing against that. We just want to make sure participants are thoughtful in making that decision.” ####  ##### “We want them to ... (make any allocations) affirmatively through the re-enrollment process,” he added. ####  ##### Barry B. Burr writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

It will keep its name for the foreseeable future, and all employees will be retained, a Towers Watson spokeswoman said. ####  ##### The purchase of Acclaris is Towers Watson's second major acquisition in about a year and half. In November 2013, Towers Watson purchased Liazon Corp., a Buffalo, New York-based operator of a private health insurance exchange, for $215 million. #### "
"Planned out-of-pocket caps for health care could cost employers","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Consumer-driven Health Plans, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### New federal health care reform law regulatory guidance ends lingering uncertainty on how much in out-of-pocket costs employers with high-deductible plans can require employees to pick up. ####  ##### The guidance, jointly issued Tuesday by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, like earlier HHS guidance, leaves intact the maximum out-of-pocket expenses employers can require employees to pay before health plan coverage kicks in: $6,850 for single coverage and $13,700 for family coverage when the rules go into effect in 2016. ####  ##### The earlier HHS guidance also added a new and potentially costly requirement for employers, who will have to cap at $6,850 the maximum out-of-pocket expense any individual with family coverage — whether an employee or covered dependent — can be required to pay before family coverage kicks in. ####  ##### Specifically under the earlier guidance, the $6,850 annual cap on how much a plan participant can be required to pay, will apply, regardless if the individual has single or family coverage. ####  ##### But that earlier guidance triggered widespread confusion. That confusion was the result of several factors, including that the rules were only issued by HHS and that a reading of the text of regulations suggested to some that the cost-sharing limitations applied only to insured plans available in the individual and small-group market, and not to self-insured plans or large insured group plans. ####  ##### The latest guidance, issued in question-and-answer format by the three federal agencies with responsibility for implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, definitively and unambiguously, ends that uncertainty. ####  ##### “The self-only maximum annual limitation on cost sharing applies to each individual, regardless of whether the individual is enrolled in self-only coverage or in coverage other than self-only. Accordingly, the self-only maximum annual limitation on cost sharing applies to an individual who is enrolled in family coverage or other coverage that is not self-only coverage under a group health plan,” the agencies said. ####  ##### An example illustrates how the HHS-imposed “embedded” limit on out-of-pocket expenses will work: ####  ##### An employer plan has a $10,000 out-of-pocket expense limit for employees with family coverage. An employee's spouse incurs $15,000 in medical care expenses. The spouse's out-of-pocket expense will be capped at $6,850, the same cost-sharing limit that would be imposed if the individual had single coverage. ####  ##### The biggest impact on the new cost-sharing rules will be on employers with high-deductible plans. For example, an Aon Hewitt survey found that just 17% of large and midsize employers offering high-deductible health care plans with health savings accounts had an embedded out-of pocket limit. ####  ##### “This guidance will especially impact many employers with high deductible plans with HSAs, requiring significant plan design changes or increased costs,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. #### "

"House committee OKs bill to repeal medical device tax","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Legislation approved Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee would repeal a health care reform law provision that imposes a 2.3% federal excise tax on manufacturers of medical devices. ####  ##### Revenue generated by the tax, which first went into effect two years ago, is used to help offset the cost of federal premium subsides provided to the lower-income uninsured who purchase coverage in public health care exchanges. ####  ##### The measure, H.R. 160, introduced by Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., and approved by the Ways and Means Committee on a 25-14 vote, would repeal the tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2013. ####  ##### “There are the laws that make no sense at all.

The ACA now defines a full-time employee as one working an average of 30 hours per week. ####  ##### That definition is a key one for employers as the law imposes a $2,000-per-employee penalty on employers that don't offer coverage to at least 70% of their full-time employees this year, while in 2016 and succeeding years, the penalty will be triggered if an employer does not offer coverage to at least 95% of its full-time employees. ####  ##### The Senate has not acted on either measure. #### "

"Hormel gets final OK to fund benefits in captive","Benefits Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Legislation & Regulation"," ##### Hormel Foods Corp. received final U.S. Labor Department authorization Friday to fund several employee benefit risks through its Vermont captive insurer. ####  ##### Hormel, the Austin, Minnesota-based producer and marketer of meat and other food products, will use the captive, Diversified Foods Insurance Co. L.L.C., to fund life and accidental death and dismemberment benefits for its employees. Policies will be issued by Zurich American Life Insurance Co. ####  ##### Hormel already uses its captive, which was licensed in 2012, to fund a variety of risks, including property, earthquake and terrorism. ####  ##### Hormel is the third employer this year to receive final approval from Labor Department regulators to fund benefit risks through their captive insurers. ####  ##### Earlier this year, the Labor Department approved captive benefit funding plans filed by Healthcare Services Group Inc., a Bensalem, Pennsylvania-based provider of management and other services to health care companies, to fund voluntary medical, life and short-term disability benefits through its New Jersey-based captive. ####  ##### Regulators also gave final approval to an application filed by Sealed Air Corp., a Charlotte, North Carolina-based packing materials manufacturer, to fund life and accidental death and dismemberment benefits through its Vermont-based captive insurer. ####  ##### All three employers sought Labor Department approval of their captive benefit funding applications through a regulatory review process known as ExPro. Under ExPro, the Labor Department must act within 45 days of a company request for an arrangement that would normally be barred by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ####  ##### To qualify for ExPro, an applicant has to cite two substantially similar individual exemptions approved in the past 10 years, or one similar exemption and one approved through ExPro within the past five years. ####  ##### In its application, Hormel cited an individual exemption The Coca-Cola Co. received in 2013 to fund group term life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment benefits through its South Carolina captive, and an exemption Intel Corp. received last year to reinsure similar benefits through its Hawaii captive. ####  ##### More employers are expected to use the ExPro approach in seeking regulatory approval for their captive benefit proposals, experts say. ####  ##### “We expect to see more captive employee benefits applications, and approvals, as favorable experience with ExPro continues to accumulate,” said George O'Donnell, technical director of global risk consulting at Aon Risk Solutions in Somerset, New Jersey, who filed Hormel's application. #### "

"Transgender benefits gain attention of employers","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### As awareness for transgender issues increases, more employers are including coverage for transition-related health care as a way to foster an inclusive workplace environment while attracting and retaining workers. ####  ##### These benefits, meant for individuals transitioning to the opposite sex, may include mental health counseling, hormone replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery. Some employers may even include coverage for facial feminization or reducing the Adam's apple, though most procedures considered cosmetic are not offered. ####  ##### Some employers who offer transgender-related benefits may provide coverage for surgical procedures of the genitalia and chest, but not hormone replacement therapy. Others may cover hormone therapy, but not surgical gender reassignment. ####  ##### There is no legal requirement for employers in the private sector to cover transition-related procedures, and few do so, but high-profile examples, such as Bruce Jenner's transition to Caitlyn, and a federal push for equal transgender rights may spur further adoption, experts say. ####  ##### A Mercer L.L.C. 2014 survey found that 8% of employers with 500 or more employees provided coverage for gender reassignment surgery in 2014, up from 5% in 2013. And 23% of employers with 10,000 or more employees offered coverage, flat from the previous year, according to the survey. ####  ##### Because of a lack of comprehensive data, it's difficult to pinpoint how many individuals in the United States identify as transgender. One regularly cited 2011 study by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law's Williams Institute estimates 700,000 individuals are transgender, not all of whom seek gender reassignment. ####  ##### A National Business Group on Health 2013 survey of large members, who NBGH said are typically at the forefront of benefits offerings, found that 60% planned to offer non-surgical transgender-related benefits in 2014, compared with 26% offering those benefits in 2007. Fifty percent of employers planned to offer transgender-related surgical benefits in 2014, up from 5% in 2007, according to the survey. ####  ##### More insurers, such as Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp., are offering coverage for transgender-related procedures as well. ####  ##### In the public sector, transgender health coverage is now widely available. The Office of Personnel Management on June 23 prohibited Federal Employee Benefit Plan providers from excluding transition-related care in their federal employee health plans, citing an “evolving professional consensus that treatment may be medically necessary” for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, that is distress caused by differences in a person's genetic sex and gender identity. ####  ##### That decision comes on the heels of the federal government's May 2014 decision to lift its ban on covering sex reassignment surgery under Medicare. ####  ##### “The federal employee health insurance programs set a tone and standard that will undoubtedly impact workers outside of the federal government,” a spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign said in an email. ####  ##### “Although this will not reach every private insurance provider, requiring those that participate in the federal program to provide complete, inclusive coverage will definitely change the way the insurance companies do business nationwide,” the spokeswoman for the Washington-based lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights advocacy group said. ####  ##### Dr. Michael Cryer, Houston-based medical director for Aon Hewitt, said he's seen more interest among employers in offering transgender health benefits this year than in the past, though adoption among his clients is still minimal. ####  ##### Most clients who offer transition-related health coverage believe it will give them an advantage when hiring employees, he said. ####  ##### “If they feel like they are in a marketplace where the other employers like themselves” offer transgender health benefits, “then they tend to offer it,” he said. ####  ##### For employers that don't offer transition-related coverage, “it's not specifically the procedure or the content of the benefit” influencing the decision, but the prospect that it could increase health care costs, he said. ####  ##### But experts say the cost to an employer is negligible compared with more common procedures, such as heart bypass surgery, partly because transgender incidence rates are very low. ####  ##### According to the NBGH survey, some employers report costs ranging from $14,000 to $500,000 yearly for the employee population, depending on the procedures. Others reported costs of gender reassignment benefits at 0.1-0.5% of total health care costs, NBGH said. The average employer responding to the survey had 35,000 employees, an NBGH spokesman said. ####  ##### “Many people are taking $100,000 dollar drugs now, so in comparison” the cost for offering transgender health benefits is “very small,” said Shari Davidson, Washington-based vice president with NBGH. Cost does not generally factor into the decision to offer the benefit even though some costs are ongoing, she said. ####  ##### Instead, those decisions are commonly rooted in science, and insurers and employers will cover treatments that are “medically necessary or no longer experimental,” Ms. Davidson said. ####  ##### Today, the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and other professional organizations say transition-related procedures are appropriate treatments for gender dysphoria. A psychiatrist will decide whether it is medically necessary for an individual to receive such treatment, according to Dr. Cryer. ####  ##### For TD Bank N.A., offering transgender health benefits “was part of our business case in having an inclusive environment,” said Cyndi DiCastelnuovo, Mount Laurel, New Jersey-based vice president of diversity and inclusion. ####  ##### “When employees feel their needs are met, and in this case from a benefits perspective, they perform at a higher level,” she said. ####  ##### TD Bank covers hormone therapy, 80% of transgender reassignment surgery expenses and general mental health services pre- and post-surgery, Ms. DiCastelnuovo said. The company does not cover cosmetic surgery. ####  ##### Ms. DiCastelnuovo said offering such benefits has helped attract and retain workers and create a “total value package for our LGBT employees.” ####  ##### For a private employer, especially those under a self-insured health plan, the risks involved in declining to offer transgender health coverage are small, but more attention on the issue has “increased potential for discrimination claims,” said Todd Solomon, a Chicago-based partner with law firm McDermott Will & Emery. ####  ##### And the number of employers offering transgender health coverage is expected to keep growing. ####  ##### “With or without (the Office of Personnel Management decision), a lot of private companies are looking to cover this. In fact, we've seen tremendous growth,” said Brenna Shebel, Washington-based vice president of NBGH. “We will see more of our members covering both nonsurgical and surgical gender reassignment benefits.” #### "
"ADP offers health exchange for full-time and contingent workers ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Human resources and benefits administration technology provider ADP L.L.C. has launched a private exchange that enables employers to assist both full-time employees and those ineligible for employer-sponsored coverage in selecting health plans. ####  ##### Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP's private exchange, launched Thursday, allows benefits-eligible employees to enroll in health plans within its existing human capital management and benefits administration platform, while also directing those part-time, temporary and contract workers to the public exchange offered through GoHealth L.L.C. ####  ##### Chicago-based exchange technology provider GoHealth powers a private health insurance exchange that also sells subsidized health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, ADP said in a statement Thursday. ####  ##### “Until now, many employers either did nothing or directed their workers who do not qualify for a group plan straight to public exchanges, where they would enroll in benefits and apply for federal subsidies often without assistance or their employer's knowledge,” ADP said. ####  ##### But ADP found that most employers are interested in assisting their benefits-ineligible workforce to enroll in health insurance as it will help them stay engaged and productive, Gerry Leonard, ADP's Alpharetta, Georgia-based president of benefit services, said. ####  ##### “There's a lot of companies who have a fairly large contingent workforce” who are not eligible for benefits through the company but are still obligated to “pick up health insurance,” Mr. Leonard said. ####  ##### Employers say “if we can easily make the products available for (contingent workers) and let them shop much more seamlessly, then we'd like to do that,” he said. ####  ##### On the GoHealth platform, employees will be able to apply for federal subsidies and compare health plans and prices. ####  ##### At the same time, employees eligible for employer-sponsored health insurance are able to shop for benefits offered through the employer's chosen insurance broker and can compare plans for price and coverage using decision support tools through ADP's exchange. ####  ##### USI Insurance Services Inc. is the first broker to partner with ADP's private exchange, but Mr. Leonard said ADP will partner with any broker or insurer. ####  ##### Currently, few employers offer employees access to a private health exchange, despite major benefits consultants, such as Towers Watson & Co. and Aon P.L.C., launching their own. ####  ##### According to the Society of Human Resource Management Inc., only 2% of employers moved to private exchanges in 2015. ####  ##### But Mr. Leonard expects more employers to shift employees to a private exchange model once the burden of compliance for the next enrollment season passes. ####  ##### “Once that wave passes, they'll move on to the next big issue, which is the excise tax” — the 40% tax on the portion of health plan premiums that exceeds $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage slated set to take effect in 2018 — he said. “They'll begin to ask for more innovative strategies to address that, and I think exchanges will begin to pick up again.” #### "

Prior to that limit, employers typically allowed employees to contribute between $3,000 and $5,000 to their FSAs, said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### Another provision specified that starting in 2014, the new limit would increase to match the rise in CPI at the close of a 12-month period ending on Aug. 31, with the increase rounded down to the nearest $50. ####  ##### In the first 12-month period, ending in August 2013, the rise in CPI resulted in an indexed amount of $2,542, which, when rounded down to the nearest $50, resulted in no increase in the maximum FSA contribution limit in 2014. ####  ##### Last year, inflation rose just enough to boost the limit to $2,550 for 2015. With the CPI barely rising since August 2014, it would take a big hike in inflation this month — unlikely given falling energy prices, for example — to boost the CPI enough to trigger a rise in the maximum FSA contribution limit for 2016, Mr. Stover said. ####  ##### While FSAs are still a part of many employers' benefit programs, employee contribution and participation rates have been falling. According to benefit consultant Aon Hewitt, the average FSA contribution per participant fell to $1,342 in 2015, down from $1,405 in 2014, while 17% of employees working for employers offering FSAs made contributions in 2015, down from 20% the prior year. ####  ##### Aon Hewitt says a likely reason for decreases are the increased popularity of consumer-driven health care plans linked to health savings accounts or health reimbursement arrangements. ####  ##### Last year, according to a Mercer L.L.C., survey, 23% of employees were enrolled in CDHPs, up from 18% in 2013, the biggest one-year increase since Mercer began to track CDHP enrollment about a decade ago. ####  ##### The reasons for those increases are many. The maximum amount of salary employees can contribute to HSAs is much higher than for FSAs, while unused HSA contributions remaining at the end of a year can be rolled over for use in succeeding years. By contrast, unused FSAs must be forfeited by the March 15 of the following year. The IRS does allow — for employers who have adopted the provision — unused FSA contributions to be rolled over, but only up to $500. ####  ##### Another factor that could further erode the prevalence of FSAs is a provision in the ACA that, starting in 2018, imposes a 40% excise tax on the portion of health care premiums exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. The ACA counts FSA contributions towards that excise tax trigger, a key reason some employers will eliminate their FSAs, Mr. Stover said. #### "
"Employer groups wary of new out-of-pocket health maximums","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### Employer groups voiced their support this week for congressional questioning of a potentially costly change to employee cost-sharing rules under the health care reform law. ####  ##### The Republican chairmen of three House committees on Friday asked U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to justify federal regulators' recent “clarification” of health care reform rules that places new limits on how much employers — primarily those offering high-deductible health plans — can require employees to pay in out-of-pocket expenses. ####  ##### Under that guidance, issued in May by HHS and the U.S. Labor and Treasury Departments, the maximum expenses employees can be required to pay before health plan coverage kicks in will be $6,850 for single coverage and $13,700 for family coverage. The rules take effect in 2016. ####  ##### However, the guidance also added a new and potentially expensive requirement for employers, who will have to cap at $6,850 the maximum out-of-pocket costs individual employees and dependents covered under a family plan can be required to pay before first-dollar coverage kicks in. ####  ##### In their letter sent Friday, Reps. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; John Kline, R-Minn., chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee; and Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asked what statutory authority Obama administration regulators have to set such caps. They also questioned why the policy change was made in the preamble and not in the regulation itself. ####  ##### The committee chairmen said they have “become increasingly concerned about agencies' actions to implement the law that appears to exceed the statutory authority delegated to them by Congress.” ####  ##### An example illustrates how the HHS-imposed “embedded” limit on out-of-pocket expenses will work: An employer plan has a $10,000 out-of-pocket expense limit for employees with family coverage. An employee's spouse incurs $15,000 in medical care expenses. The spouse's out-of-pocket expense will be capped at $6,850, the same cost-sharing limit that would be imposed if the individual had single coverage. ####  ##### “Our position is that we don't think the statute allows for this kind of interpretation,” Debbie Harrison, assistant director of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington, said Tuesday. ####  ##### The cost-sharing rules will hit employers with high-deductible plans hardest. An Aon Hewitt survey found that just 17% of large and midsize employers offering high-deductible health care plans with health savings accounts had an out-of-pocket limit. ####  ##### “To get that guidance at such a late date, which basically means that employers have to redo their out-of-pocket limits for family coverage, is going to cause a pretty substantial scramble in order to comply,” Ms. Harrison said. “We were hoping that they would at least delay implementing the rule for a year, just to give employers time to make those adjustments, but we're not really sure that's going to happen.” ####  ##### Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, said Friday that her organization was “pleased that Chairman Kline directly questioned Secretary Burwell about this issue at a recent hearing and that the three committees of jurisdiction are concerned about how this guidance was developed and whether its impact on employers and employees was properly considered.” #### "

Those subsidiaries will grant PBGC a “springing lien” on the protected assets. The lien would be triggered if the company fails to make required contributions to its pension plan, makes prohibited transfers of ownership interests, terminates the plan or files for bankruptcy. ####  ##### As of Jan. 1, the company's U.S. pension fund had $3.62 billion in assets and $5.88 billion in liabilities, for a funding ratio of 61.56%. ####  ##### Sears froze its pension plan in 2006. ####  ##### In a statement, Sears said it will continue to make required pension contributions, and that it does not foresee a basis for an involuntary or distress plan termination. The PBGC agreed to not initiate an involuntary termination. ####  ##### “This agreement results from good faith discussions between the PBGC and the company and is another positive step forward for the company; it provides meaningful protections to the PBGC while preserving the company's financial and operational ability to continue implementing the transformation,"" said Edward S. Lampert, Sears Holdings' chairman and CEO. ####  ##### PBGC said the agreement, which is conditioned on completion of definitive documentation in the next 60 days, provides meaningful protections to the Sears plan's 200,000 participants, and to the agency's pension insurance program. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"NLRB's joint-employer decision opens worker benefits to potential changes","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The National Labor Relations Board's controversial decision to expand the definition of “joint employer” could have costly implications for employers when it comes to the health and retirement benefits they provide, benefits lawyers say. ####  ##### It's a “huge decision and (there are) implications for benefits and every aspect of employer-employee relationships,” said Ricki Roer, New York-based partner and national chair of the employment and labor team with law firm Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker L.L.P. “Nothing is going to be off the table” for collective bargaining, she said. ####  ##### In a 3-2 decision on Aug. 27, the NLRB ruled that Browning-Ferris Industries of California Inc. is a joint employer with Leadpoint Business Services, a staffing agency hired to supply workers for one of its recycling plants. The Teamsters union had filed a petition to represent the Leadpoint workers and sought the right to collectively bargain with Browning-Ferris rather than Leadpoint, arguing that the two are joint employers. ####  ##### In its ruling, the NLRB changed the standard for how it determines joint employers by considering whether a company exerts control indirectly through an intermediary over matters of employment. Historically, the NLRB has considered a company to be a joint employer if it exercises “direct and immediate control” over employees, according to the decision. ####  ##### The new standard is “to better effectuate the purposes of the (National Labor Relations) Act in the current economic landscape,” the NLRB said in a statement accompanying its ruling. ####  ##### But the new standard potentially opens up any employer that hires contract employees for services to a host of liabilities, experts say. ####  ##### “Employers now are exposed to contributing a lot more money to benefits if they are jointly employing,” said James Sconzo, a shareholder at law firm Carlton Fields Jorden Burt in Hartford, Connecticut. Because the definition of joint employer is “ill-defined,” he said, there's a “cascade of, I think, unintended consequences.” ####  ##### Contract workers for small and large companies, including franchise workers, could now theoretically unionize to bargain for benefits and other terms of employment, he said. Of course, there would be an expensive legal fight before that happens, he said. ####  ##### “This is going to open the door for collective bargaining for employee benefits and so much more,” Ms. Roer agreed. ####  ##### Browning-Ferris could appeal the NLRB's decision, but the ruling is “a clear indication that this is a path we're moving in,” Ms. Roer said. There's a trend of employers increasingly seen as responsible for individuals rendering work for the organization, regardless of “whose name appears on the paystub,” she said. ####  ##### The decision “can lead down the road to benefit implications,” said Ben Conley, Chicago-based employee benefits attorney with Seyfarth Shaw L.L.P. However, “I don't think we're there yet,” he said. ####  ##### While the U.S. Department of Labor and now the NLRB have taken a more expansive view on who the employer is, “the last shoe to drop will be the IRS,” Mr. Conley said, because the Internal Revenue Service drives most benefits considerations. ####  ##### “If the IRS starts broadening the scope of who they consider to be your employees, then it's really going to change the landscape,” he said, because if parent companies are required to offer contract workers benefits “regardless of whether you hire them from a temporary staffing agency or not,” there is less of a reason to use a “middleman.” ####  ##### That could cause “people to revisit … what their hiring practices are,” he said. #### "
"Bipartisan Senate bill aims for Cadillac tax repeal ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Health Care Costs"," ##### Bipartisan legislation introduced Thursday in the Senate would repeal the health care reform law's so-called Cadillac tax. ####  ##### Under that provision, a 40% excise tax, starting in 2018, will be imposed on the portion of group health care plan premiums exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. ####  ##### An earlier analysis by benefit consultant Towers Watson & Co. projected that 48% of employers with at least 5,000 employees that offer health plans could be hit by the excise tax in 2018, with 82% affected by 2023. ####  ##### The legislation, introduced by Sens. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., would repeal the tax on Dec. 31, 2017, just before its effective date. ####  ##### “Doing away with this onerous tax on employees' health coverage before it goes into effect will protect important benefits for workers and ensure businesses and families get a fair deal,” Sen. Heinrich said in a statement. ####  ##### Business groups strongly back repeal of the tax. “The effect of the 40% excise tax goes beyond employers; it could be detrimental to the health of millions of employees and their families if employers are forced to curtail their health benefits in order to avoid the tax,” Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, said in a statement. ####  ##### “Repealing the 40% tax, thereby preserving high-quality employer-sponsored health coverage, should and would be a bipartisan, bicameral success story,” said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington and a member of the diverse Alliance to Fight the 40 coalition recently organized to fight the excise tax. ####  ##### Similar legislation, H.R. 2050, was earlier introduced in the House by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn. That measure now has 145 co-sponsors. #### "

"Financial education works as another angle on employee wellness ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Voluntary Benefits"," ##### ORLANDO, Fla. — Financial education should be folded into existing wellness programs to help employees alleviate stress from money matters, increase productivity and avoid stress-related health problems, benefits professionals say. ####  ##### “There's a solid, solid argument around how focusing on (financial wellness) is good for the company,” Jeffrey Tulloch, Westport, Connecticut-based vice president of MetLife Inc.'s financial programs PlanSmart and Business Advantage, said Tuesday during the 2015 Employer Healthcare & Benefit Congress in Orlando, Florida. “It's great for the employee — we all need this — but done correctly, it can help drive productivity.” ####  ##### Most employees enter the workplace after schooling with no financial education and are ill-equipped to handle their personal finances, he said. ####  ##### The lack of knowledge leads can lead to stress in the workplace, reduced productivity and increased medical spending from stress-related conditions, he said. ####  ##### But employers that have wellness programs can “leverage them to really help change people's lives,” Mr. Tulloch said. ####  ##### Workers are looking for help, he said, citing a 2014 MetLife study that found 49% of employees had no access to workplace financial education but were interested in having such programs. ####  ##### When designing a financial wellness program, Mr. Tulloch recommended tailoring the curriculum to meet employee needs. If a company has a diverse workforce, the program needs to be broad enough to cover all demographics' financial issues. ####  ##### Employers also need to drive engagement and participation in the program through strong workplace communications, he said. ####  ##### Georgetown University, which launched financial wellness as part of its total wellness program in 2007, offers monthly financial wellness workshops and an annual financial education conference focusing on topics that include buying a home, saving to pay for children's college and caring for aging parents, Charles DeSantis, chief benefits officer of the Washington-based university, said during the session. ####  ##### Georgetown's annual conference sees 20% of its 5,000 benefits-eligible employees attend, he said. ####  ##### Financial education is an essential component of an organization's holistic wellness strategy, Mr. DeSantis said. ####  ##### “It has to be part of your wellness program, because people are well when they are doing something about their finances or thinking about it, and when they are actually taking care of their health,” both mind and body, he said. ####  ##### The first step, he said, is to simply get workers to begin thinking about the subject by letting them know financial education is available. It's also necessary to conduct all education workshops during work hours and include an employee's entire family in the program, he said. ####  ##### It's important not to view results in terms of the return on investment. Instead, providing tools for people to improve their finances and retirement readiness is about making workers feel valued and cared for, Mr. DeSantis said. #### "

"U.S. insurers hold back Lilly's death-defying diabetes drug","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Cigna, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### (Reuters) — America's largest health insurers are urging doctors to stick with current standard treatments for diabetes instead of flocking to a new drug from Eli Lilly & Co. that is showing it can provide life-saving results for one-third of patients. ####  ##### Aetna Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Molina Healthcare Inc. said they would need further clinical data and a change in medical society guidelines on Lilly's Jardiance before agreeing to make it easier for patients to receive the $4,800-a-year treatment. That's a process that could take anywhere from 18 months to several years. ####  ##### UnitedHealth Group Inc., Anthem Inc., Express Scripts and Cigna Corp. said they would also still adhere to the traditional treatment regime based largely on cheaper generic drugs and carefully review the data before making any changes. ####  ##### Their stance is likely to disappoint investors who are betting that Jardiance will leap from $11 million in global sales last quarter to $5 billion annually by 2020. Lilly reported last month that Jardiance slashed cardiovascular deaths by 38% in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading Wall Street analysts to predict it would become widely used in the United States. How the drug does this is a mystery given its mild benefits of lowering blood pressure, blood sugar and weight. ####  ##### “It always makes me nervous when we have a drug that we can't explain,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, who runs Medicaid provider Molina Healthcare based in Long Beach, California. “Before we rush out and adopt this on a wide basis, we need more studies and other drugs tested as well.” ####  ##### Lilly shares rose nearly 10% when it disclosed the Jardiance data, but have since given back those gains amid a wider selloff among biotech stocks. Lilly and its partner, German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, sponsored the Jardiance trial, which was conducted in hospitals and research centers in 42 countries. ####  ##### But the cumulative costs of treating the large number of patients with type 2 diabetes — the most common form, with 24 million sufferers in the U.S. — year after year is giving insurers pause, adding to a debate over whether the high price of U.S. medicines is justified by their ability to fight disease. Most patients with type 2 diabetes, which is highly linked to obesity, die of heart disease. ####  ##### Competing drugs such as Merck & Co.'s Januvia or Novo Nordisk's Victoza carry similar price tags to Jardiance. Doctors may want to prescribe Jardiance instead of those therapies, which have not shown the same ability to prevent deaths from heart attack or stroke. Jardiance, approved last year, may also replace other drugs, such as generic sulfonylureas. ####  ##### They may turn to Jardiance earlier on, or even use it instead of metformin, the $60-a-month generic that is usually the first prescription written for a diabetic. ####  ##### Insurers allow their members to use Jardiance or others in the same class but typically charge a higher patient co-payment and may reimburse its use only after metformin is taken for a number of months. ####  ##### JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note he expects the Jardiance data to drive growth over time and will be watching for prescriptions to pick up in late 2016 or 2017. He expects 2016 sales to rise to $837 million. ####  ##### Other potential uses for the drug could add millions of more prescriptions not yet factored in by Wall Street. The results on diabetic patients are leading cardiologists to consider testing the drug on non-diabetics at risk of heart disease. The American Heart Association will feature a discussion of Jardiance's prospects at its annual meeting in November. ####  ##### Slow down ####  ##### Insurers, who were as surprised by the data as the investors, said Wall Street should slow down. Many want to see if a similar treatment from Johnson & Johnson, Invokana, shows comparable benefits in clinical trial results expected in 2017. ####  ##### That would give insurers a stronger case to pit Lilly and the makers of similar drugs against each other, a tactic they employed with Gilead Sciences Inc.'s blockbuster hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi earlier this year after a competitor hit the market. They have also enforced coverage policies that are slowing down the expansion of new cholesterol fighters from Amgen Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. ####  ##### David Kendall, vice president of medical affairs for Lilly's diabetes franchise, said he hopes insurers will allow greater use of Jardiance as soon as possible, and that medical societies will promptly update their treatment guidelines to prescribe Jardiance instead of other treatments. ####  ##### “We would hope undue delay isn't an outcome; we would hope for timely decision-making,” Mr. Kendall said. ####  ##### Excess glucose ####  ##### Jardiance, a pill taken once daily, is among the class of drugs known as SGLT2 inhibitors which work by helping the kidneys excrete more excess glucose in urine. This class of drugs can produce side effects including a higher rate of infection and a potentially fatal condition involving excess acid in the blood. ####  ##### The global market for SGLT2 inhibitors reached $400 million last year, with Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca P.L.C. in the lead, according to brokerage Cowen and Co. Generic pills and insulin are the most widely used treatments in the $36 billion global diabetes drug market. ####  ##### “It could be 2017 before insurance companies will advocate this as a preferred agent,” said Dr. Carol Wysham, head of the diabetes and endocrinology department at Rockwood Clinic in Spokane, Washington. “They aren't going to do anything until they have to.” ####  ##### CVS, like other insurers, wants to hear from the nation's top medical groups on diabetes and see the results of more studies. In addition to Johnson & Johnson's long-term Invokana study, AstraZeneca is conducting a study on Farxiga, which is due in 2019. Either one could suggest whether Jardiance alone prevents death in a high percentage of diabetes patients, or whether it is a shared trait of the drug class. ####  ##### “There is a lot more to be gained in making sure that people are taking older, less expensive drugs than there is in adding new more expensive drugs into the mix,” CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan said in an interview, referring to the problem of patients skipping on their medications. “I see no indication from this study of a wholesale change in the treatment outline.” ####  ##### The American Diabetes Association, the Joslin Diabetes Center and the Endocrine Society said they need to gather specialist doctors and review the data to consider whether to draft new treatment guidelines, a process that would likely take a year or two. ####  ##### Aetna's chief medical officer for pharmacy, Dr. Edmund Pezalla, described the data as a “pleasant surprise” and said Jardiance has the potential to save medical costs for patients down the road. ####  ##### The company, which prefers customers use J&J's Invokana over Jardiance, is preparing for an increase in use. “We probably are not going to see everybody going onto these medications,” Dr. Pezalla said. “We do see changes in utilization when studies that are positive come out.” ####  ##### Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, treats diabetes as part of his cardiology practice. He has never prescribed Jardiance but said he would probably do so now, beginning gradually and prescribing it earlier than current guidelines suggest. ####  ##### “I try to be responsible about cost-effective prescribing, but most people are not controlled on metformin alone,” he said. #### "
"Public health insurance exchange enrollment expected to grow in 2016","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Enrollment in public health insurance exchanges is expected to grow modestly in 2016, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services analysis released Thursday. ####  ##### By the end of 2016, enrollment in the exchanges — a key component of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — is expected to range from 9.4 million to 11.4 million, up from an HHS-projected enrollment of 9.1 million at the end of 2015. ####  ##### Exchange enrollment at year-end 2016 of 10 million individuals “is a strong and realistic goal,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement accompanying the report. ####  ##### “We've seen high levels of satisfaction with the (exchange) marketplace and expect the vast majority of our current customers will re-enroll,” Ms. Burwell added. ####  ##### In its enrollment projections, HHS estimates that between 7.3 million to 8.8 million individuals — mostly lower-income Americans eligible for federal premium subsidies — now enrolled in plans offered through the exchanges will select or automatically enroll in exchange plans next year. ####  ##### In addition, between 2.8 million and 3.9 million uninsured individuals will opt for coverage during the 2016 open enrollment, while between 900,000 and 1.5 million individuals who now have coverage outside the exchanges will select an exchange plan in 2016. ####  ##### Combining those projections, HHS estimates that between 11 million and 14.1 million individuals will sign up for coverage during open enrollment, which generally begins on Nov. 1. ####  ##### But by year-end 2016, enrollment will be lower compared to the number of people who signed up for coverage during open enrollment. ####  ##### “As is the case with any well-functioning market, HHS expects to see customers come and go as their life circumstances change,” such as when enrollees drop coverage when they land jobs and become eligible for employment-based coverage, HHS said. #### "

Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Mike Lee, R-Utah; and Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; oppose the bill: They want the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act repealed. ####  ##### “If this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules, we cannot support this bill,” the senators said in statement referring to the budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 3762, that contains the excise tax repeal provision, which the House of Representatives passed last week. ####  ##### “With millions of Americans now getting health premium increase notices in the mail, we owe our constituents nothing less,” the senators said. ####  ##### The GOP lawmakers' opposition plus the near certainty that President Barack Obama would veto the budget bill further decreases chances that lawmakers will repeal the tax, observers say. ####  ##### “It is a blow,” said Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, adding that repealing the tax during the current congressional session always has been a long shot. ####  ##### Repeal will “become harder,” added Damian Myers, a senior associate at law firm Proskauer Rose L.L.P. in Washington, who said backers of repealing the excise tax cannot afford to lose any more support if the budget bill is to win Senate approval. ####  ##### “The more senators on board, the better it will be,” said Steve Wojick, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. ####  ##### Still, excise tax repeal supporters say they are not giving up. ####  ##### “We will continue to campaign to get support for repealing the tax,” Ms. Fildes said. ####  ##### The impact of the excise tax will be widespread, surveys have found. ####  ##### A recent analysis by benefit consultant Towers Watson & Co. projected that 48% of employers with at least 5,000 employees that offer health plans will be hit by the tax that offer health plans could be hit by the excise tax in 2018, with 82% affected by 2023. Other surveys found that a smaller number, though still a substantial percentage, of employers would be affected by the tax. ####  ##### Among other things, business groups say the tax is unfair because its application would not recognize wide geographic differences in health care costs. ####  ##### In addition, the IRS has yet to propose regulations that would aid employers in complying with the tax. #### "
"Walgreens' Rite Aid acquisition includes pharmacy benefit management unit","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. will acquire rival drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp., a deal which includes Rite Aid's small pharmacy benefit management subsidiary and marks the latest development in a movement to consolidate U.S. PBM businesses. ####  ##### Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens announced late Tuesday it will acquire Rite Aid for $17.2 billion in cash and acquired debt. ####  ##### The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said during a conference call Wednesday with investment analysts. ####  ##### “This combination will further strengthen our commitment to making quality healthcare accessible to more customers and patients. Our complementary retail pharmacy footprints in the U.S. will create an even better network, with more health and wellness solutions available in stores and online,” Mr. Pessina said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### It is unclear how Rite Aid's PBM, Envision Pharmaceutical Services, which it acquired in June, will fit into Walgreens' strategy, and a Walgreens spokesman declined to comment. ####  ##### During Wednesday's conference call, Alex Gourlay, president of Walgreen Co., labeled Envision “an important but relatively small PBM business” that will “help us understand access in America better” and “create a market which is affordable.” ####  ##### “We think this could be a way into that in terms of Envision,” Mr. Gourlay said. ####  ##### Mr. Pessina added the PBM will provide “a good opportunity to learn.” ####  ##### Walgreens previously exited the pharmacy benefits space in 2011 when it sold its PBM unit to Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. ####  ##### And more recently, Mr. Pessina in April told Forbes that buying a PBM is “not necessarily the best model for the future” and said it was an unlikely step for Walgreens. ####  ##### But a string of recent deals have led to PBM consolidation, which provides those businesses with more mass and bargaining power to negotiate with drug makers over drug prices. For example, Optum Inc., a unit of United HealthCare Services Inc., in July bought rival Catamaran Corp., a PBM based in Schaumburg, Illinois. ####  ##### Additionally, CVS Health Corp. in August acquired pharmacy services provider Omnicare Inc., and in June bought the pharmacy stores and medical clinic of Target Stores Inc. #### "

The center provides primary health care, physical medicine, behavioral health, vision services and health coaching to employees of Intuit Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other large technology companies, according to a statement from Towers Watson and Crossover Health. ####  ##### “Drawing from our proven experience with onsite centers for large employers, we have followed the growing interest from smaller employers that sought a similar offering but did not have enough employees or real estate to offer an onsite health center themselves,” Dr. Scott Shreeve, CEO of Crossover Health, said in the statement. “The near-site concept is designed to solve this dilemma by allowing employers to pool resources and offer their employees a remarkable, patient-driven health experience that delivers lower costs and increases quality.” ####  ##### The companies plan to open several other near-site health centers in Northern California in 2016. ####  ##### “Employers welcome cost-effective and innovative solutions that keep employees healthy and productive, and the near-site option opens the opportunity for more employers to access this attractive offering,” said Andrew Halpert, a San Francisco-based senior health care management consultant at Towers Watson, which is providing implementation support, quality oversight and performance measurement through its partnership with Crossover Health. #### "
"County joins public employers ditching domestic partner benefits","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Orange County, Florida, this week joined a growing list of public sector employers phasing out health care coverage and other benefits for domestic partners. ####  ##### County commissioners in Orlando voted unanimously on Tuesday to discontinue Orange County's domestic partner benefit program effective Jan. 1, 2016, with a one-year grace period ending Dec. 31 of next year for current enrollees in the program. ####  ##### Orange County, which covers roughly 900 square miles of central Florida and employs approximately 10,400 workers, began offering spousal-equivalent health care, retirement and other benefits to gay and lesbian employees' domestic partners in 2012, since same-sex marriages were not recognized under federal or Florida state law. ####  ##### In an Oct. 7 memo to the board of commissioners, Orange County Human Resources Director J. Ricardo Daye said the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in 2013 and in June of this year striking down federal and state bans on same-sex marriage “nullified” the need to offer benefits to same-sex domestic partners. ####  ##### “The intent of the program was to ensure parity for same-sex couples who did not have the option to marry in the state of Florida,” Mr. Daye said in the memo. “The program was not available to opposite-sex couples because they have always had the right to marry.” ####  ##### The county's board of commissioners also voted 7-0 to remove same-sex domestic partners from eligibility for bereavement leave, effective Dec. 31, 2016. ####  ##### “By eliminating domestic partner benefits, Orange County is taking a significant step backwards,” Stratton Pollitzer, deputy director of the St. Petersburg, Florida-based LGBT rights group Equality Florida Action Inc., said in a statement following the board of commissioners' vote. ####  ##### “Numerous studies also show that providing the option of domestic partner benefits is good for business,” Mr. Pollitzer said. “The costs are extremely low, averaging only about one percent of total benefits costs, and providing the benefits creates a significant, measurable increase in employee morale and productivity that more than makes up the expense.” ####  ##### Several other public sector employers have elected to drop domestic partners from their employee benefit programs in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which declared state laws banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional. ####  ##### Earlier this month, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that federal employees will no longer be able to offer dependent health, dental and vision coverage to their same-sex domestic partners' children as of the end of the 2015 plan year. ####  ##### Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University and the University System of Georgia — which comprises more than 30 public colleges across the state — all discontinued domestic partner benefits within the last few months, as have the cities of Charlotte, North Carolina and Cleveland, Ohio. ####  ##### According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 34% of gay and lesbian employees in the public sector had access to domestic partner health benefits in 2014, and 50% of those employees' domestic partners were eligible for survivor benefits under their partner's pension plan. #### "

"Health insurance satisfaction declines: Survey ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Health Insurers"," ##### People in group health plans are more dissatisfied with their employer-provided health coverage than consumers in general, and customer satisfaction with health insurance has reached its lowest level in a decade, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. ####  ##### Health insurance now ranks the fifth-lowest of industries ranked in the study that began in 1994 as a joint effort of the University of Michigan and American Society for Quality. Only fixed-line telephone service, the U.S. Postal Service, subscription television services and Internet service providers rank lower, according to the survey released Monday. ####  ##### High premiums, deductibles and copayments as well as slow processing are some reasons customer satisfaction has declined to a score of 69 for health insurance customers overall and 68 for those with group health coverage. Both groups' opinions do improve, however, if they have more than one type of coverage from which to choose, according to the study. ####  ##### “The health insurance industry is in the midst of merger mania among large insurers that could tighten the field if the federal government grants approval: Humana-Aetna and Anthem-Cigna. Ongoing consolidation among the big players is not likely to bode well for an industry that is already underwhelming its policyholders, as characterized by low and declining customer satisfaction.” ####  ##### Health insurers' best performance was in access to primary care, access to specialty care doctors and hospitals, and website capabilities, according to the annual survey of about 70,000 customers. #### "

"U.S. drug benefit managers clamp down on specialty pharmacies","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, UnitedHealth Group"," ##### (Reuters) — In recent days, the largest U.S. managers of private prescription drug benefits have cut off at least eight pharmacies that work closely with drugmakers, intensifying scrutiny of a system that helps inflate drug prices, officials at the pharmacy benefit managers told Reuters. ####  ##### The terminations come from payers who together manage drug benefits for more than 100 million Americans, and they follow disclosures by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in late October that one pharmacy accounted for about 7% of its sales. ####  ##### ""What we had not been aware of, until really the last year, was these type of pharmacies that have a really high proportion of sales from a drugmaker and it was not out in the open,"" Everett Neville, senior vice president of supply chain at Express Scripts Holding Co., said in an interview. ####  ##### The actions are being felt by drugmakers that have come to rely on hefty price hikes to boost profits. Valeant's closely-linked pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services L.L.C., pressed insurers to pay for expensive Valeant treatments even though much cheaper generic alternatives were available. ####  ##### Shares of Valeant have lost more than half their value since its pharmacy ties were made public. ####  ##### Mr. Neville said Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager, has changed the algorithms it uses in its audits to find pharmacies focused heavily on one drug manufacturer and has cut ties with half a dozen such pharmacies in the past week. ####  ##### Express Scripts and OptumRx Inc., part of UnitedHealth Group Inc., have also found pharmacies engaged in extensive mail-order operations without proper accreditation. CVS Health Corp., the No. 2 pharmacy benefits manager, said in an email that it had reviewed pharmacies with ties to drug manufacturers and was removing those that fell short of its contract. It did not give further details. ####  ##### All three of the big benefits managers have quit doing business with Philidor. Mr. Neville at Express Scripts was careful to note that the pharmacies being eliminated are not true ""specialty"" pharmacies that help manage drugs for rare diseases. ####  ##### ""The Valeant-Philidor relationship woke payers up to potential problems in their pharmacy networks,"" said Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, which follows the drug distribution industry. ""We are now seeing much greater scrutiny of the independent pharmacies that may not be complying with payer requirements."" ####  ##### Growth from price hikes ####  ##### For large pharmaceutical companies, U.S. pricing gains have accounted for roughly 46% of worldwide revenue growth over the past three years, according to Sector & Sovereign analyst Richard Evans. ####  ##### U.S. drug prices rose an estimated 12% to 13% last year, and consumers are being asked to pay more of the total cost as health insurance deductibles and copayments increase. ####  ##### ""Drug cost has been the single biggest driver of health care spend over the last two years. It wasn't prior to that,"" said Dr. John Bennett, CEO at Capital District Physicians' Health Plan, a nonprofit based in Albany, New York. ####  ##### Certain pharmacies have contributed to higher drug prices by driving customers to expensive treatments instead of cheaper generics, pharmacy benefit managers say. Many help drugmakers to cover the out-of-pocket costs for consumers, lightening their load but leaving health insurers to pay the rest. ####  ##### Independent pharmacies and their drugmaker partners counter that Express Scripts, CVS and OptumRx together control more than two-thirds of the market through their own mail-order operations. The specialty pharmacies say that the benefit managers are trying to curb the explosive growth of smaller, independent players. ####  ##### ""Our philosophy of ensuring that patients get the medicine their doctors prescribe is threatening Express Scripts' profiteering and exposing what we believe is a lack of care for patients and respect for physicians,"" Horizon Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Timothy Walbert said last week. ####  ##### Express Scripts has cut reimbursement to Linden Care Pharmacy, a New York-based pharmacy that distributed Horizon drugs. ####  ##### A booming business ####  ##### Specialty pharmacies were first formed in the 1970s to deliver products requiring special handling to doctors' offices and hospitals, including therapies for cancer, HIV/AIDS or hemophilia. The field has evolved to include mail-order operations that offer services for complex, high-cost drugs, often for rare or chronic diseases. ####  ##### The growth of such pharmacies has been fueled by a record number of specialty treatments coming to market for everything from hepatitis C to cystic fibrosis. Pembroke Consulting estimated that the number of accredited specialty pharmacies would jump by nearly 100 to a total of 250 in 2015. ####  ##### Diplomat Pharmacy Inc., the nation's largest independent specialty pharmacy, is the sole distributor of three medications for very small patient populations: Exelixis Inc.'s thyroid cancer drug Cometriq, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' leukemia drug Synribo, and Keveyis, a treatment for temporary paralysis made by Taro Pharmaceuticals. ####  ##### ""We handle drugs for complex, chronic conditions. Many were previously a death sentence,"" said Sean Whelan, chief financial officer. Net income at Diplomat, which went public in 2014, nearly tripled in the first nine months of this year from the same period a year ago. ####  ##### But the Philidor example shows how some pharmacies are being used to dispense more ordinary, and expensive, prescriptions. Philidor was selling Jublia, a toenail fungus treatment that retails for about $500 for a small bottle. The treatment is only moderately effective: It cured about 18% of patients in one clinical trial after one year. ####  ##### Linden Care was selling Duexis, Horizon's top drug, which combines the common pain killer ibuprofen and famotidine, the generic version of heartburn drug Pepcid. It costs about $500 for a 30-day supply. ####  ##### Valeant has denied allegations that it used Philidor to inflate revenue, but is in the process of cutting its distribution arrangements with the pharmacy. Philidor, which will soon shut down, insists its employees behaved ethically. ####  ##### This week, Linden Care Pharmacy sued Express Scripts, while New York City-based Irmat Pharmacy sued OptumRx for moving to terminate their contracts. ####  ##### At Irmat, 60% of the prescriptions being sent to OptumRx for payment were from two drugmakers, a source familiar with the situation said. Irmat said in its lawsuit that revenue skyrocketed after it contracted in 2013 with Nestle S.A.'s Galderma S.A., and Aqua Pharmaceuticals, part of Spain's Almirall. Neither company was immediately available for comment. ####  ##### Eileen Wood, chief pharmacy officer at CDPHP, said the health plan rejected 4,700 claims from Philidor and related pharmacies this year, nearly all of which were for Valeant products. CDPHP works with CVS for pharmacy benefits. ####  ##### Ms. Wood also called ""very suspicious"" the 477 claims CDPHP received from Linden Care this year, noting that 90% were for drugs from Horizon or its subsidiaries. All were rejected. ####  ##### Officials at Linden Care did not respond to requests for comment. #### "
" Pharmacy sues OptumRX over removal from its network","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Specialty pharmacy Park Irmat Drug Corp. is suing OptumRx, saying the pharmacy benefit unit of UnitedHealth Group plans to remove Irmat from its network as of the end of the month. ####  ##### In the suit, filed late on Thursday in New York Supreme Court, Irmat said it received notice that it will be cut off from reimbursement by OptumRx, which operates a mail-order pharmacy that competes with Irmat, particularly for medicines that treat dermatological ailments. ####  ##### Irmat is the latest specialty, mail-order pharmacy to be dropped by a payer after drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc was accused of using its close ties with Philidor Rx Services to improperly inflate revenue. Valeant has denied the allegations and cut ties with Philidor, prompting other payers to follow suit. ####  ##### OptumRx did not have an immediate comment on the lawsuit. ####  ##### Several pharmacy benefit managers, including OptumRx, have removed Philidor from their networks and said they are evaluating other specialty pharmacies. ####  ##### Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, has cut Linden Care pharmacy from its network, citing close ties with drugmaker Horizon Pharma LLC. ####  ##### Irmat is seeking an injunction barring Optum from terminating or excluding it. Irmat said it was in danger of going out of business as the result of Optum's action. ####  ##### Irmat's mail-order business has been an unmitigated success. From 2012 to 2015, the pharmacy's business grew exponentially, both in revenue and geographic scope. ####  ##### By way of example, Irmat's revenue from Optum members increased from approximately $1.99 million in 2012, to $3.8 million in 2013, to $15.3 million in 2014, and was projected to grow to $33 million in 2015. ####  ##### In its lawsuit, Irmat says it began in 2013 to participate in programs sponsored by drugmakers Galderma SA and Aqua Pharmaceuticals under which the manufacturers covered patient co-payments on leading dermatological drugs. ####  ##### Galderma is owned by Nestle SA. Aqua is owned by Almirall SA #### "

"Firm offers pharmacy benefit manager analysis for self-insured employers ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Technology, TPA"," ##### Benefit administration firm SKYGEN USA on Tuesday launched a data analytics company, Hylis Pharmacy Solutions, which aims to save self-insured employers costs associated with nontransparent pharmacy benefit contracts. ####  ##### By analyzing past claims data, Mequon, Wisconsin-based Hylis provides self-insured employers with the actual cost of delivering pharmacy benefits to their members, looks for reasons the employer may be paying too much, and offers recommendations on how to help reduce and control group prescription drug benefit costs, according to a company statement released Tuesday. ####  ##### The firm claims to be able to deliver between 15% and 25% savings, Hylis said in the statement. ####  ##### PBMs administer prescription drug programs for employers and negotiate with pharmacies to achieve better pricing, Hylis said. They also often work to reduce the cost of group prescription drug programs by developing formularies and encouraging the use of generic drugs over brand name pharmaceuticals, Hylis said. ####  ##### But there is often a lack of transparency in how PBMs make their money, according to the statement. For example, some PBMs engage in spread pricing, meaning they pay pharmacies one amount to dispense the prescriptions, but bill plan sponsors at a greater margin and pocket the difference, Hylis said. ####  ##### Hylis will perform an analysis of a plan sponsor's prescription drug spending for free, and will charge a percentage of the realized savings if changes need to be made to the pharmacy benefit program, according to the statement. ####  ##### Hylis said it will continue to validate the data on an ongoing basis to ensure savings are maintained. ####  ##### “While the industry is focused on savings, the complexity of the transactions and the lack of transparency make it difficult for plan sponsors to determine whether those savings are being maximized,” Hylis CEO Greg Borca said in the statement. “Hylis Pharmacy Solutions can pull back the veil and deliver real insight to help most plan sponsors save anywhere from 15 to 25 percent on their costs.” #### "
"Health insurer hammers out risk-based deal for costly anti-cholesterol drug discount","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs"," ##### Health insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has struck a deal with drugmaker Amgen for its new cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha. ####  ##### In addition to providing a discount, Amgen will be at risk financially if health plan members' cholesterol levels aren't lowered enough. ####  ##### Insurers and pharmacy benefit management companies have aggressively pursued discount negotiations with drugmakers to stem the tide of rising drug costs, and Harvard Pilgrim's deal with Amgen is one of the first to add a pay-for-performance element on top of the discount. But it's uncertain if this tactic will catch on, or if it will do anything to curtail high drug pricing. ####  ##### “The pharmaceutical segment has remained primarily in a traditional 'pay-for-pill' model,” Harvard Pilgrim Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Sherman said. With the latest deal, Amgen is “putting their money where their mouth is,” he said. ####  ##### The retail price of a year's supply of Repatha costs $14,100, slightly less than the $14,600 price tag of Praluent, the other major cholesterol drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration this past summer. Harvard Pilgrim did not negotiate any agreement for Praluent, which means Repatha will be on its preferred formulary. Express Scripts Holding Co., a PBM, said last month it would cover prescriptions for both Praluent and Repatha. ####  ##### Sherman declined to say how much the price was reduced. All contracts with pharmaceutical companies have confidentiality clauses that prohibit those terms from being disclosed, but Sherman said the discount was “material.” ####  ##### Amgen executives recently told investors that they would not disclose discounts given to third-party payers. For the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs made by Gilead Sciences, the average discounts were around 50% of the sticker price, but the drugs still cost more than $40,000 for a course of treatment, raising questions of whether discount negotiations broadly help the system. ####  ##### A report this year from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said the new class of cholesterol drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors that go after a person's “bad” cholesterol, are extremely overpriced. Based on cost-effectiveness measures, those drugs should cost $2,520 per year, the group said. ####  ##### Unique to the deal is that Amgen will have to provide larger rebates to Harvard Pilgrim if patients' low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are not lowered to “what was observed during clinical trials.” Harvard Pilgrim can also receive additional rebates if the drug is used more than a predetermined amount, which essentially lowers costs on a per-prescription basis. The insurer said it still wants to encourage patients to use lower-cost statins. ####  ##### Insurers have experimented with risk-sharing with drug companies in the past. Cigna Corp. did it with Merck & Co.'s diabetes medications, and Health Alliance Medical Plans, owned by Urbana, Ill.-based health system Carle Foundation, created a value-based deal for the osteoporosis drug Actonel. Sherman said he believes conversations about value-based contracting for prescription drugs will become more commonplace. ####  ##### “We hope that the pharma companies will finally start to realize this is the right way to align with the healthcare delivery and financing system,” Sherman said. ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"FSA rollover to retirement plan proposal introduced  ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### Employees would be allowed to transfer unused amounts of up to $250 a year from their flexible spending accounts to retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, under legislation introduced in the House of Representatives last week. ####  ##### Under the measure, H.R. 4067, introduced by Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., employees could shift unused FSA funds — $250 or the account balance, whichever is less — to a retirement plan. ####  ##### Under 2013 IRS regulations, employees can, if their employers offer such a feature, automatically carry over up to $500 in their FSA accounts to the next year to pay medical expenses. ####  ##### That approach is an alternative to one the IRS authorized in 2005. Under that so-called “grace period” approach, FSA participants can roll over their full unused balance remaining at the end of a plan year. However, the balance must be used by the end of the first 2 1/2 months of the following plan year or be forfeited. #### "
"Company doctoring: More employers offer on-site clinics","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### Laitram Machinery Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of shrimp-peeling machines, sits along the Mississippi River under the Huey P. Long Bridge, just outside of New Orleans — a suitable location for a company associated with a food product that's central to southern Louisiana's celebrated Creole and Cajun cuisine. ####  ##### But there's a health downside to that rich culture. “In New Orleans, you can find ways to not eat well and not drink well,” said Franck LaBiche, the company's human resources director. ####  ##### Letting les bons temps rouler wasn't just bad for the company's workers. It also was rough on its finances. “We were looking at a monthly health care premium curve for employees that showed a 40% increase over six years,” said Mr. LaBiche, whose company has a self-insured health plan. ####  ##### In 2012, Laitram joined a growing list of large U.S. employers that have opened on-site health clinics in an effort to control the rising costs of their health benefit programs. Nearly 30% of companies with more than 5,000 workers now have on-site or near-site clinics offering some type of primary care, up from 24% in 2013, according to a survey this year by benefits consultant Mercer L.L.C. In addition to serving employees, some clinics also treat workers' families. Many of these facilities include fitness centers with exercise equipment. These services often are provided without charge to employees. ####  ##### This has produced a growth market for companies that operate clinics for employers, including Healthstat Inc., Marathon Health, Premise Health Holding Corp. and QuadMed L.L.C. Health systems also have jumped into the market, operating about 18% of worksite clinics, according to benefits consultant Towers Watson & Co., which surveyed firms with clinics this year. Downers Grove, Illinois-based Advocate Medical Group has a division called Advocate at Work that operates worksite clinics for about 120 companies, including financial services firm Northern Trust Corp. and the Chicago Tribune. ####  ##### “Being the largest integrated delivery system in the area, it was a natural fit for us to figure out how to leverage our expertise for the benefit of these companies,” said Dr. Prentiss Taylor Jr., Advocate At Work's corporate medical director. ####  ##### According to Towers Watson, 64% of employers with an on-site clinic contract the work to a vendor, while 23% are operated directly by the employer. ####  ##### Employers say these clinics provide primary and preventive care, and encourage exercise, thus keeping workers healthier, reducing absenteeism and cutting benefit costs. They say the on-site centers reduce the amount of time workers spend away from work visiting off-site health care providers. In addition, the centers can help companies identify occupational health and safety risks, such as poorly designed workstations that result in back and neck problems. ####  ##### Because they believe in the cost-saving potential of on-site clinics, many employers plan to continue investing in them even though the cost will likely be included in calculating the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax on high-value health plans starting in 2018. Earlier this year, the Internal Revenue Service said spending on on-site clinics would be considered in the tax calculation unless the clinics offered only “de minimis” care. ####  ##### Two-thirds of large employers with on-site health facilities say they plan to expand such facilities, according to the Towers Watson survey. “That's validation of their belief that the clinics are reducing cost,” said Allan Khoury, senior health management consultant at Towers Watson. ####  ##### But Vivian Ho, a Baylor University health economist, questioned whether these clinics will yield significant cost savings. The employees most likely to use the clinics are those who already are the most health conscious, while the unhealthiest and most expensive employees will still be unlikely to get needed preventive care, she said. Beyond that, the payoff from preventive medicine often comes years later, perhaps after the employees have left the company. ####  ##### In addition, she said employees may be reluctant to use workplace clinics because of concerns about privacy. Many employees already fear their employers will use their health information against them. “I think these are legitimate worries,” she said. ####  ##### Workplace clinics are actually an old concept. Decades ago, some industries with high occupational injury rates employed company doctors and nurses to treat workers. Kaiser Permanente grew out of employer-sponsored clinics to provide care for workers in shipyards and steel mills before World War II. ####  ##### In more recent years, rising costs have prompted employers to look beyond traditional occupational health to offer broader primary care for office and industrial workers, said Larry Boress, executive director of the National Association of Worksite Health Centers and CEO of the Midwest Business Group on Health. ####  ##### These newer employer-sponsored clinics typically have nurse practitioners or physician assistants on staff, though some also have full-time or part-time physicians. Some feature specialty providers such as physical therapists and nutritionists. About half offer pharmacy service. The on-site health clinic at Facebook Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California, has a chiropractor. Many also include fitness centers. ####  ##### The scope of services offered varies, with most offering at least urgent care but many providing broader services. Many offer flu shots, and some can even take X-rays. Some offer healthy cooking classes. United Airlines, which has clinics for its employees at airports in Chicago, Houston and Newark, has doctors and physical therapists at each, in addition to nurse practitioners and physician assistants. ####  ##### For some employees, the on-site clinics may provide their only regular health care. For workers who do have a regular provider, employers want the workplace clinic to complement rather than replace those providers. At Laitram, for example, employees can sign a consent form allowing the on-site clinic to share medical records with outside clinicians. ####  ##### One concern for employers opening on-site clinics, particularly in smaller communities, is upsetting independent physicians and other providers in the community who may worry about losing patients to worksite providers. But Mr. Boress said 40% to 60% of people who go to on-site clinics don't have a personal doctor. Laitram's Mr. LaBiche said that the company clinic sometimes sends patients to a local health system with which it has an agreement, and that the system may end up getting more patients. ####  ##### Some clinics, such as Laitram's, provide services without charge to employees covered by the company's health plan. Those who aren't covered pay a fee. Sometimes the fitness centers also are free, though some charge a small membership fee on the belief that people who pay for a gym membership are more likely to use it. ####  ##### Mr. LaBiche said the company's health clinic, operated by Winooski, Vermont-based Marathon Health, and its fitness and nutrition center, run by LifeStart Wellness Network, are improving employee health and reducing the company's health benefit costs. Employee visits to hospital emergency rooms have dropped 26% since 2010, and nearly 8 in 10 workers have seen improvement on at least one measure of health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol or body fat percentage, he said. The company's health benefit costs were flat between 2012 and 2014, though they increased about 5% this year. ####  ##### Still, there's not much hard data on return on investment for employers, aside from anecdotal information from companies such as Laitram. Towers Watson's survey found that more employers are now measuring ROI, though only 12% have commissioned independent analyses. Mr. Khoury said the ACA's Cadillac tax will force employers to take a harder financial look at the clinics. “The excise tax will put a lot of focus on whether they actually are reducing cost,” he said. ####  ##### Advocates of workplace clinics say they can be useful in improving occupational health and safety for a company's workforce. If a significant number of workers are reporting back and neck pain, the company can conduct an ergonomics assessment of employees' desk and seating arrangements and make modifications, said Daniel Lord, a chiropractor who heads physical medicine at Facebook's health center. ####  ##### United Airlines uses data on the types of injuries the clinics are treating to spot trends and improve its safety training. “We can see what body parts to focus on out on the ramp,” said Terry Werber, the airline's manager for the on-site clinics. ####  ##### More than a dozen companies have started worksite clinics for employers. Marathon Health now operates 140 on-site clinics in 38 states. Another large firm in this niche is Brentwood, Tennessee-based Premise Health, created last year by the merger of Walgreens' Take Care Employer Solutions division and CHS Health Services. It operates more than 500 on-site health clinics, pharmacies and fitness centers in 46 states. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Healthstat has more than 300 facilities in 32 states. Another company, Sussex, Wisconsin-based QuadMed, runs more than 100 clinics in 20 states. ####  ##### Hospitals and health systems have taken notice of the industry's growth and have launched initiatives. Advocate Medical Group's Advocate at Work operates worksite clinics for about 120 companies, and serves the 32,000 employees of its parent company, Advocate Health Care. Mr. Taylor said being part of a large health system such as Advocate extends the value of the clinic, because it can help patients navigate the broader health care maze, including specialist referrals. “We interact with the entire health care system for the benefit of the employee,” he said. ####  ##### One worker who attests to the value of an on-site clinic is Gregg Schenck, an information technology developer at Laitram. He said having the health care providers and fitness and nutrition specialists at his workplace and getting to know them made it easier for him to seek care. ####  ##### Mr. Schenck weighed 350 pounds when he went in for a health consultation and a weight-loss program. He worked with staff at the fitness center, which he started using regularly since it was so convenient. He was motivated by the support of co-workers, who praised his progress as he lost 110 pounds. ####  ##### “The doctor has taken me off the diabetes medication, the acid reflux has gone away, and my blood pressure has come down,” Mr. Schenck said. “I really see it as a saving grace.” ####  ##### David Royse writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Milwaukee bank to complete pension plan phase-out","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Bank Mutual Corp. will completely freeze its defined benefit pension plan at the end of this month, completing a process that the Milwaukee-based bank began in 2013. ####  ##### The phasing out of the plan began on Jan. 1, 2013, when Bank Mutual closed off the plan to new employees.  Then, effective Jan. 1, 2014, the company stopped benefit accruals of plan participants with less than 20 years of service. ####  ##### The latest action, which Bank Mutual estimates could reduce pension related expenses by $2.5 million in conjunction with certain changes in actuarial assumptions, will apply to the remaining 10% of employees still accruing plan benefits. ####  ##### Bank Mutual earlier beefed up its 401(k) plan. ####  ##### At year-end 2014, the bank’s pension plan was significantly underfunded with $50.2 million in assets and $71.8 million in liabilities, according to its 10-K statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. #### "

"Two-year 'Cadillac' tax delay may signal repeal later","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### Congressional leaders have unveiled a $1.1 trillion budget deal that would delay the controversial “Cadillac” tax by two years — a major win for business groups and employers that have called for its repeal. ####  ##### The spending deal unveiled late Tuesday would push the start date of the excise tax from the current 2018 to 2020. ####  ##### For many, that is a sign that a full repeal is on its way. ####  ##### The “Cadillac” tax imposed by the health care reform law would impose a 40% excise tax on the part of group health plan premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. ####  ##### “We see the two-year delay as a down payment on a full repeal,” said Katy Spangler, Washington-based senior vice president of health policy at the American Benefits Council, which has called for the tax's repeal on behalf of hundreds of large employers it represents. ####  ##### According to the council, the excise tax would increase employer costs and reduce access to care. ####  ##### “It gives Congress and the administration more time to work on the repeal and evaluate the potentially negative consequences of the tax,” said Steve Wojcik, Washington-based vice president of policy at the National Business Group on Health, which he said applauds the delay. ####  ##### The two-year postponement also “really clouds the outlook for implementation of the tax,” said Geoffrey Manville, principal of government relations at Mercer L.L.C. in Washington. ####  ##### He said the decision will likely “fall to the next Congress and the next president.” The odds of a repeal of the excise tax are “better than even.” ####  ##### The two-year delay also gives employers time to figure out how to reduce their health plan costs to avoid triggering the tax, he said. ####  ##### According to an NBGH survey of 140 of the largest U.S. corporations taken before the latest congressional action, 48% of employers expect at least one of their benefit plans to hit the excise tax in 2018 if they don't take measures to control rising health care costs. By 2020, 72% expect one of their plans to trigger the tax. ####  ##### The $1.1 trillion budget deal still needs to be approved by Congress, but the White House has signaled it will not veto the deal over a two-year Cadillac tax delay, Washington newspaper The Hill reported. ####  ##### Also included in the budget package is a moratorium on the health reform law's medical device tax for 2016 and 2017. That tax went into effect in 2013. ####  ##### The congressional proposal also would have the U.S. comptroller general and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners study whether the reform law uses “suitable” benchmarks to determine whether the tax should be adjusted to reflect age and gender factors in setting the excise tax thresholds. ####  ##### The claims data of the benchmark the law now uses — Blue Cross Blue Shield's standard benefit option under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program — has been criticized as an inaccurate representation of the national workforce. #### "
"Hospitals launch specialty pharmacies to curb drug costs","Benefits Management","Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### With specialty drug spending soaring 60% in the past five years, large health systems have jumped into the specialty pharmacy business to assert some control over those costs by dispensing the drugs to their patients and covered employees. ####  ##### Health systems say those pharmacies help them better manage outpatient drug costs. A growing number of insurance contracts and Medicare initiatives tie payments to quality metrics that reach beyond hospital stays to hold providers accountable for patients' total medical costs, including drugs. ####  ##### It's also a robust business for those systems that can successfully negotiate with manufacturers and health plans so they can compete with the bigger players. ####  ##### “It you want us to be responsible for the total cost of care, allow us to be able to care comprehensively for these patients,” said Dick Schirber, a spokesman for ExceleraRx Corp., a for-profit specialty pharmacy services company owned by six health systems. Comprehensive care, Mr. Schirber said, includes managing the very expensive prescriptions that patients take at home for cancer or chronic diseases, so that providers have more control over waste as well as complications. ####  ##### ExceleraRx provides services to system-owned specialty pharmacies, such as negotiating with drugmakers and handling data reporting. ####  ##### Phoenix-based Banner Health started its own specialty pharmacy last year, taking its business away from Premier Inc., which acquired Commcare Specialty Pharmacy in 2010 for $35.9 million. Banner employees enrolled in the system's health plan were the pharmacy's first customers. ####  ##### “For everyone, everywhere, the pharmacy expense is increasing,” said Pam Nenaber, Banner's CEO of pharmaceutical operations. ####  ##### Banner Health hired three clinical pharmacists, three patient advocates and three staff members to support operations. The system also spent $1 million on a drug-dispensing robot for the specialty pharmacy's new home-delivery service. The robot fills pill bottles, which are verified by a pharmacist before being shipped. Clinical pharmacists also talk to patients at home to answer prescription questions. ####  ##### In the first year, Banner shaved about 1% off its specialty drug spending for about 1,200 workers and their families covered by the system's employee health plan. ####  ##### Health systems that own specialty pharmacies argue they can do a better job overseeing the use of the drugs they dispense. That's because their pharmacies can easily access medical records, laboratory results and physician notes, allowing pharmacists to closely monitor the effectiveness of the drugs prescribed and react quickly when something goes wrong or patients need help. ####  ##### “They know if the patient is getting the value for the high-cost drug,” said Steven Rough, director of pharmacy for the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, which began handling transplant drugs in 2006 and expanded its specialty pharmacy in 2011. ####  ##### Launching a specialty pharmacy does not require significant capital investment, and the high prices of the drugs — even sold at slim margins — make it possible to quickly see a return on that investment. ####  ##### “It's a quite viable business,” said Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic, which opened its specialty pharmacy roughly a year ago, and advises other systems to do the same. “Get on it and get on it fast,” he said. ####  ##### The Cleveland Clinic estimates it will recoup its upfront investment from the specialty pharmacy's profits within 16 months of opening. ####  ##### That's true even as the Ohio health system expands its operations. The pharmacy is hiring more staff because the volume of prescriptions has increased about 10% a month. It now employs 25 workers, and that number is expected to reach 66 employees within three years. ####  ##### New drugs last year boosted spending for specialty pharmaceuticals 25% over the prior year, IMS Health Inc. reported in April. Specialty drugs to treat diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C now account for one-third of drug spending. Sovaldi and other new treatments for hepatitis C boosted spending by $12.3 billion, IMS said. ####  ##### Specialty drug spending ####  ##### Pharmaceuticals still account for just 10% of U.S. health care spending, but a 12.3% surge in 2014 — including $12.6 billion spent on new specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C — contributed to the year's uptick from the record-slow health spending that started with the Great Recession. ####  ##### That growth makes dispensing specialty drugs an increasingly important piece of health care delivery, as well as an attractive business line, said John Ransom, a managing director of health care research at Raymond James Financial Inc. “It's riding the wave of where the innovation is,” he said. ####  ##### But systems will face fierce competition as they try to ride that wave, Mr. Ransom said. “It can be a tough business.” ####  ##### They will have to vie with national pharmacies like CVS Health Corp., Express Scripts Holding Co. and Diplomat Pharmacy Inc. to be included in health insurance networks. CVS and Express Scripts also own pharmacy benefit-management companies, so they “have a vested interest in limiting the network of specialty pharmacies because they are specialty pharmacies,” Mr. Ransom said. ####  ##### Pharmaceutical manufacturers also limit shipping of some of their drugs to a handful of pharmacies, in what are called limited-distribution networks. ####  ##### Getting a spot in drug manufacturers' limited networks requires intense negotiation, and the capacity to report quality and use data back to drugmakers. ####  ##### ExceleraRx, launched in 2012 with investment from Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services, helps its owners and clients with those tasks. Englewood, Colorado-based Catholic Health Initiatives, which opened its own specialty pharmacies in Kentucky and Nebraska last year, invested in ExceleraRx to “supercharge” the new business line, said Nick Barto, the health system's senior vice president for capital finance. ####  ##### However, another danger for providers is that patients may begin to see them as “the organization that's providing the drugs that you can't afford,” said Benjamin Isgur, director of thought leadership at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P.' Health Research Institute. ####  ##### But health system executives say they've hired staff to help patients identify discounts, coupons and other financial aid for drug costs not covered by insurance. And health systems can further market their independence from shareholders and the pharmaceutical industry. ####  ##### Melanie Evans writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Supreme Court rejects new challenge to health care reform law","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Supreme Court, which delivered major rulings in 2012 and 2015 preserving President Barack Obama's signature health care law, on Tuesday declined to take up a new, long-shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by an Iowa artist. ####  ##### The court turned away an appeal by Matt Sissel, who had asserted that the 2010 Affordable Care Act violated the U.S. Constitution's requirement that revenue-raising legislation must originate in the House of Representatives, not in the Senate, as the health care law did. ####  ##### The high court left in place a 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholding a lower court's dismissal of the lawsuit, which was backed by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group. The suit targeted the law's ""individual mandate"" that Americans obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty. ####  ##### In a 6-3 ruling last June, the Supreme Court rejected a conservative legal challenge and upheld nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the health care law. In 2012, the justices ruled 5-4 that the law's requirement that Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty was authorized by the power of Congress to levy taxes. ####  ##### A three-judge appeals court panel was unanimous in finding that Mr. Sissel's interpretation of the law was at odds with U.S. Supreme Court precedents, including the high court's ruling in 2012. The court found that the penalty for not obtaining insurance was a form of taxation. ####  ##### The law was passed by President Obama's fellow Democrats in Congress in 2010 over the unified opposition of Republicans, and conservatives who call the measure a government overreach have fought it since its inception. The landmark law was designed to provide health care for millions of uninsured Americans. ####  ##### President Obama this month vetoed legislation passed by the Republican-led Congress that would have dismantled the law. ####  ##### In the spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case brought by religious groups seeking an exemption from a provision of the law that requires them to provide contraception coverage in their health insurance policies. ####  ##### The case is Sissel v.

"Ford pension plan funding improves globally, but U.S. plans lag","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Ford Motor Co. on Thursday said the funded status of its pension plans significantly improved in 2015 due to strong investment returns racked up by the automaker’s pension plans outside the United States. ####  ##### At year-end 2015, Ford’s pension plans worldwide were underfunded by $8.2 billion, down sharply from $9.8 billion a year earlier, according to financial reports released by Ford. ####  ##### Ford’s pension plans outside the United States were underfunded by $4.5 billion in 2015, down sharply from $7.5 billion in 2014. That steep decline in underfunding was largely due to a 7.7% return on plan assets. ####  ##### By contrast, underfunding of Ford’s U.S. pension plans jumped to $3.7 billion last year, up from $2.3 billion in 2014. In its reports, Ford noted that its U.S. pension plans had a return on assets of minus 1.8% last year compared with a 16.4% return in 2014. ####  ##### Ford sharply reduced contributions to its pension plans in 2015, pumping in $1.1 billion, down from $1.5 billion in 2014. ####  ##### Ford did not disclose its pension plans’ assets and liabilities.

"General Motors pension plan funding improves in 2015 ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Aided by higher interest rates that lowered the value of benefit liabilities, the funded levels of General Motors Co.’s U.S. pension plans rose in 2015. ####  ##### At year-end 2015, the plans were underfunded by $10.4 billion, with $61.1 billion in assets and $71.5 billion in liabilities, the automaker reported Wednesday in a 10-K report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. By contrast, the plans were underfunded in 2014 by $10.9 billion, with $65.8 billion in assets and $76.7 billion in liabilities. ####  ##### GM’s pension plans are substantially smaller than a few years ago, the result of pioneering moves to shrink the plans. ####  ##### For example, at year-end 2011, the U.S. plans had nearly $109 billion in liabilities and about $94 billion in assets. One year later, the plans had $82.1 billion in liabilities and $68.1 billion in assets. ####  ##### That roughly $27 billion reduction in liabilities that occurred between 2011 and 2012 was the result of twin actions the Detroit-based automaker took in 2012 to reduce the size of its pension plans. ####  ##### One of those steps was an offer GM made to 44,000 salaried employees who retired after Oct. 1, 1997, and before Dec. 1, 2011, to convert their monthly annuities to a cash lump-sum payment. In all, GM paid about $3.6 billion to the 13,000 plan participants who accepted the offer. ####  ##### As the second part of its pension de-risking strategy, GM purchased a group annuity from Prudential Insurance Co. of America for $25.1 billion. The annuity replaced benefits that about 76,000 salaried employees who retired before Oct. 1, 1997, received from GM, as well as retirees who declined the lump-sum conversion offer. #### "
"'Huge potential' for funding employee benefits risks through captives ","Benefits Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Costs"," ##### BOCA RATON, Fla. — Only a sliver of the world's roughly 7,000 captive insurers fund their parents' employee benefit risks, but that number is likely to grow significantly as more employers become aware of the advantages. ####  ##### “There is a huge potential for growth,” said Lorraine Stack, a senior vice president with Marsh Captive Solutions in Dublin. ####  ##### Ms. Stack and other panelists who spoke Monday at a session at the 25th annual World Captive Forum in Boca Raton, Florida, detailed the most compelling advantage of the approach: cost savings. ####  ##### For certain lines of coverage, such as group-term life insurance and long-term disability, the cost savings — compared with buying the coverages in the traditional market — range from 15% to 25%, panelists said. ####  ##### “The captive earns the underwriting profit and investment income earned” on premiums paid to the captive, said Kathleen Waslov, a senior vice president with Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. in Boston. ####  ##### Another advantage to the approach — compared with buying coverage in the commercial market — is that the captive sponsor has greater control over the design of the benefits offered to employees, Ms. Waslov said. ####  ##### Still, shifting employee benefit programs to a corporate captive is not an approach that employers can implement overnight. ####  ##### The funding of certain benefit risks, including disability benefits, life insurance and health insurance, requires approval from the U.S. Department of Labor. ####  ##### If the captive sponsor can qualify for a regulatory review approach known as ExPro, the entire review and approval process can be completed in well under three months, captive experts say. To qualify for ExPro, though, an applicant has to cite two substantially similar individual exemptions approved in the past 10 years, or one similar exemption and one approved through ExPro within the past five years. ####  ##### Without ExPro, the review process can be two or three times longer. ####  ##### “You need to seek Labor Department approval. And that can be a fairly lengthy process,” said Debbie Liebeskind, a senior Willis Towers Watson actuarial consultant in Parsippany, New Jersey. ####  ##### In addition, Labor Department requirements — enhancing participants' benefits and using a commercial insurer to issue policies — that have to be met to win regulatory approval of captive benefits funding proposals are costs that need to be considered by employers thinking about using the approach, panelists noted. ####  ##### Another factor employers need to consider before moving ahead is the ability of corporate risk and employee benefits departments to work together. ####  ##### Shifting funding of corporate benefit programs to captives “takes a lot longer if the parties don't have strong relationships,” Ms. Liebeskind said. ####  ##### But even in situations when an employer decides, after review, not to shift funding of benefit plans through their captives, cost savings still are possible. ####  ##### Ms. Waslov cited a situation where an employer's long-term disability insurer lowered its rates after the employer told the insurer of its plan to fund the coverages through its captive. ####  ##### Employer consideration of the captive benefits funding approach enabled the company to gain more leverage with the insurer, Ms. Waslov said. #### "

"Employers focus on physical, mental issues' effect on performance","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Disability"," ##### SAN FRANCISCO — Top U.S. employers are focusing on finding the value on investment of wellness and mental health programs, instead of focusing solely on affecting the bottom line of the company. ####  ##### Employers speaking Monday during a panel discussion at the Integrated Benefits Institute's Annual Forum in San Francisco said they are finding more success with wellness programs by connecting worker health to top-line business measures instead of focusing solely on health costs and other financial metrics. ####  ##### “We're trying to move away from health being a return on investment on a program,” Dr. Ben Hoffman, chief medical officer of global health services at Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co., said during the panel discussion. “We're looking at health as a value. And when you start thinking of health as a value, you start focusing less on quantifying things because frankly it's very difficult ... to quantify the impact of a lot of these programs.” ####  ##### “We want to make sure that we're tying everything back to the business because, ultimately, the only reason we're all there is to build tires,” said Dr. Brent Pawlecki, chief medical officer of Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. ####  ##### At American Express Co., for example, health care, pharmacy, disability, workers comp costs, as well as data from health risk assessments and biometric screenings, are integrated in a database, tracked and analyzed to “not only manage our costs” but to show which areas of the business performance are affected by workers' health issues, said Dr. Wayne Burton, global corporate medical director of New York-based American Express. ####  ##### “The point is to link the health of our employees in the U.S., but also outside the United States, to the productivity and the business needs,” Dr. Burton said. ####  ##### After initiating the database in 2011, American Express found that the mental health of the workers in its call centers was a driver “not of costs related to health care or pharmacy benefits, but a driver of disability … and also a driver of productivity,” Dr. Burton said. ####  ##### At its call centers, which are staffed predominantly by young women, the major mental health concerns included depression, anxiety disorders and stress, which weighed on the productivity and quality of the workers' customer service, Mr. Burton said. ####  ##### By linking workers' health risk assessments to customer service surveys, the firm found that customer service suffered as a result of the mental health issues among workers at the call centers. ####  ##### In response, American Express hired mental health counselors for its onsite clinics in the United States, expanded its employee assistance program and hired a psychologist to help direct its mental health initiatives, Dr. Burton said. ####  ##### “Healthier employers are able to provide better customer service,” he said. As workers' mental health improved, so did customer service quality at American Express. #### "
"Chevron 401(k) participants sue company over fund performance, high fees ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, Energy, General liability"," ##### Participants in Chevron Corp.'s 401(k) plan have sued the company and plan executives, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty for, among other things, paying “unreasonable investment management fees,” providing a money market fund instead of a stable value fund and offering underperforming mutual funds. ####  ##### The alleged breaches are in a lawsuit seeking class-action status, filed Feb. 17 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco against the company and members of the investment committee of the $19 billion Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan, San Ramon, Calif. ####  ##### “Chevron selected high-priced share classes of mutual funds, instead of identical lower-cost share classes of those same mutual funds, which were readily available to the plan,” said the complaint, filed by Jerome J. Schlichter, founding and managing partner of Schlichter, Bogard & Denton L.L.P. ####  ##### “Chevron also failed to adequately investigate and to offer non-mutual fund alternatives, such as collective trusts and separately managed accounts,” the complaint said. “Each mutual fund in the plan charged fees far in excess of the rates Chevron could have obtained for the plan by using these comparable products.” ####  ##### The complaint alleges the Chevron plan has offered a Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund as its sole capital preservation option since February 2010. Chevron “imprudently and disloyally … failed to provide a stable value fund as the plan investment option” in violation of the plan's investment policy statement to “provide a high degree of safety and capital preservation,” the complaint said. ####  ##### The complaint noted that Chevron replaced some mutual funds, switched some mutual funds to cheaper share classes and moved some investments to separate accounts or collective investment trusts from mutual funds during the past six years. The complaint argued that 401(k) plan executives should have acted sooner than they did. ####  ##### The participants argue the plan has paid “excessive” record-keeping fees to Vanguard Group in part because the record-keeping contract hasn't been subject to an RFP in six years. “A competitive bidding process … would have produced a reasonable record-keeping fee for the plan,” the complaint said. “Chevron failed to prudently monitor and control Vanguard's record-keeping compensation to ensure that only reasonable fees were paid for record keeping and administrative services.” ####  ##### Representatives from Chevron could not be immediately reached for comment. ####  ##### Robert Steyer writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"More insurers embracing telehealth","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama resisted paying for most telehealth services for years after their introduction. ####  ##### The insurer, which holds a near-monopoly of the state's commercial market, had cost concerns about the still-evolving technology that electronically connects patients with doctors and other clinicians. ####  ##### There wasn't even a clear definition of what qualified as a telehealth visit. Should doctors submit a telehealth claim for every patient phone call? Should real-time video visits be the primary catalysts for payment? Should telehealth be used mostly for primary care treatments such as ear infections and colds? Should it include more specialized care like psychiatry? ####  ##### “What is the definition of telemedicine?” asked Doug McIntyre, vice president of network operations at BCBS of Alabama. “People struggled to really tell us what that is.” ####  ##### But BCBS of Alabama, which operates in a mostly rural state where many people have trouble accessing care, recently shifted gears, in large part because of rapid advances in enabling telehealth technologies. ####  ##### As of last Dec. 1, the insurer began paying providers for five telemedicine services, including behavioral health and stroke. Amid rising demand, the insurer determined that the technology used to treat patients in those categories was “indistinguishable from a face-to-face visit,” Mr. McIntyre said. Earlier last year, BCBS of Alabama also struck a deal with Teladoc Inc. to add telehealth for urgent care to its group benefit plans. ####  ##### More private insurers are paying for telehealth services, a trend experts say will boost relatively low levels of utilization. More than half of states now have laws with rules addressing telehealth coverage. ####  ##### Nearly all payers now believe telehealth will help rural members access providers and may attract companies that want to offer modern conveniences to employees of the Netflix generation, who expect on-demand services. Insurers are also hoping telehealth will live up to its hype by keeping people out of more expensive health care settings. ####  ##### “They've begun to see the financial value in making these offerings available,” said Nate Lacktman, a health care lawyer at Foley & Lardner L.L.P. who specializes in telehealth matters. ####  ##### Looking ahead, telehealth advocates and providers see seniors on Medicare as the next major arena for growth. Roughly 1 in 5 people older than 65 live outside of a metropolitan area, and seniors usually have worse access to primary care physicians and specialists if they live in rural areas. Many older adults in urban and suburban areas also face difficulties traveling to their doctors' offices for frequent appointments. ####  ##### “When you're looking at the chronic condition situations, or simple rural situations (for telehealth), they're (equally) or more relevant to the older population,” said Patricia Smith, former CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. ####  ##### But Medicare still has restrictive rules for telehealth payment. Insurance, provider and technology trade groups are stepping up their lobbying efforts to pass legislation that will force Medicare to provide greater financial support for the service. ####  ##### The origins of telemedicine stretch back to the space race in the 1960s. NASA wanted to see how a zero-gravity environment affected astronauts' vital signs. NASA's desire to monitor the health of its faraway astronauts nurtured a curiosity in “Earth-bound physicians trying to diagnose or treat a patient in a remote location,” reads a 1996 essay in the Bulletin of the Medical Library Association. ####  ##### Today, telehealth includes everything from telephone consultations and live video feeds via Skype to digital CT scans and remote monitoring of intensive care units. Behavioral health, dermatology, radiology, infectious disease and stroke are commonly covered service lines, and primary care services are becoming a major focus, since they usually involve quicker diagnoses. ####  ##### But telehealth didn't have much of a track record. Teladoc, which has a member base of more than 12 million people, admitted as much when it went public in 2015: “The telehealth market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, consumer acceptance and market adoption,” the company stated. ####  ##### The big fear among payers is that telehealth will merely become an add-on to existing services — a reimbursed phone call or Skype chat that comes before or after the office visit. Medicare, in particular, has been “afraid it's going to blow the doors off spending,” said Jon Linkous, CEO of the American Telemedicine Association, a related trade group. ####  ##### However, the progression of higher-quality video equipment, smartphones and faster Internet connections is beginning to allay skeptics' cost concerns. Clearer, sharper telehealth interactions presumably will prevent patients from making duplicative in-person visits. ####  ##### As more people come to value telehealth, it's likely insurance purchasers will assume telehealth visits are covered by their plans. States are moving quickly to establish standards. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have private telehealth coverage laws, with eight of those states enacting new laws in 2015 alone. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates 32 states will have laws in effect by 2017. ####  ##### The statutes vary wildly, Mr. Lacktman said, but they broadly mandate commercial insurers to pay for telehealth services. Some stipulate coverage only for certain media, such as real-time video. Others require specific criteria only if payers choose to offer telehealth. Insurers in 23 states with stricter telehealth parity laws have to cover telehealth services at rates equivalent to in-person visits. ####  ##### Medicare, on the other hand, restricts telehealth payment to extremely narrow circumstances, reserving it as an outlet only for seniors who live in rural communities. For example, patients must live outside a metropolitan area, and they must be physically located at specific clinical sites when receiving telehealth. ####  ##### Medicaid's coverage is more in line with private payers since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gives wide latitude to the states. Coverage of live video telehealth services is almost universal. ####  ##### But the extent of coverage varies. California's Medicaid program, for instance, permits telehealth services to be provided to anyone in any setting, while Idaho Medicaid will pay only for telehealth if the patient is in a rural area with a shortage of providers. A majority of Medicaid programs do not have geographical restrictions, according to the Center for Connected Health Policy. ####  ##### Many large national carriers, including Aetna Inc., Anthem Inc. and UnitedHealthcare Inc., cover virtual physician visits in urban and suburban areas, as well as for their rural beneficiaries. In fact, most major commercial insurers and self-insured employers will include some kind of telehealth benefit. ####  ##### It's a centerpiece offering for some insurance startups like Oscar. Copays and deductibles usually apply, but total out-of-pocket costs usually don't exceed $50 for a basic visit. ####  ##### “With today's modern family and professional life and the practicalities of getting to the doctor, we need to offer the access and convenience of a virtual visit,” said Michael Radeschi, director of product management at Highmark Inc., a Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate based in Pittsburgh. ####  ##### He cautioned that the technology can't replace all the nuances of in-person clinical care, despite rhetoric from technology optimists who say medicine eventually will be able to be delivered through an iPad. “If we found ourselves at 40% to 50% of professional services that were telehealth, we'd be a little nervous,” Mr. Radeschi said. ####  ##### Most insurers use third-party companies to manage telehealth functions. Teladoc, Doctor on Demand Inc. and American Well Corp. are among the nascent field's leaders. Anthem created its own telehealth joint venture with American Well called LiveHealth Online. ####  ##### Despite a growing willingness to pay for telehealth, it still hasn't penetrated primary care in any significant way. Only 15% of 1,500 family physicians used telehealth in their practices, according to a survey last fall from the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies, the American Academy of Family Physicians and Anthem. ####  ##### More than half of the doctors surveyed said a lack of payment was the top barrier to using telehealth in their practices. Many physicians had no idea what Medicare, Medicaid or private insurers paid for telehealth services. “Insurers could do a better job of informing physicians of what their current reimbursement is,” said Miranda Moore, a health economist at the Robert Graham Center. ####  ##### Demand from health care consumers also remains meager, although it is growing. Demand was tepid after Highmark entered virtual medicine with Teladoc, so it expanded its service by adding Doctor on Demand and American Well to its networks. Those two vendors emphasize video visits, whereas Teladoc is more Web- and telephone-based. Not much has changed yet. ####  ##### “It creates a lot more buzz than it does use,” Mr. Radeschi said. Only 4% to 5% of Highmark's national commercial members have used telehealth services, and the usage rate in the insurer's Affordable Care Act exchange plans is below 2%. ####  ##### John Jesser, president of Anthem's LiveHealth Online, said his telehealth firm manages “thousands” of visits a year, but he declined to share specific figures. ####  ##### Anthem is pushing LiveHealth Online more — 15 million Anthem members across group, individual and Medicare Advantage plans now have access to it. But most people don't know it's part of their plan. ####  ##### “This is like the early days of Amazon when you were still able to buy books,” Mr. Jesser said. ####  ##### The limited uptake in the commercial market is still way ahead of Medicare, which almost always sets the bar for private insurance determinations. The American Telemedicine Association's Linkous called Medicare the “Luddite” of telehealth because of its strict limits on how, when and where it can be provided. ####  ##### “If you're a prisoner, a Medicaid recipient or an employee, you can get a telemedicine service,” Mr. Linkous said. “But if you're a Medicare recipient, you can't really, so it's a little crazy.” ####  ##### Medicare paid only $17.6 million in telemedicine services in 2015, practically a rounding error in the $634 billion program. The Congressional Budget Office has been highly skeptical of claims that telehealth coverage will reduce Medicare spending, and the budget scorekeeper recently said it doesn't have enough data to weigh in. ####  ##### Congress is taking up the issue. A bipartisan group of legislators introduced a bill this month, the CONNECT for Health Act, that would loosen some of Medicare's rules. Telehealth and remote patient monitoring would become standard for Medicare's alternative payment models and Medicare Advantage. ####  ##### The CMS has acted on a few fronts. For example, Medicare will waive some telehealth requirements for Next Generation accountable care organizations. Mr. Linkous expects there will be full Medicare coverage for telemedicine within the next decade because baby boomers and employees who have already used the services are “going to start demanding it.” ####  ##### Mr. McIntyre of BCBS of Alabama recently used Teladoc for what he called a persistent, annoying cough. An antibiotic didn't help, so the provider recommended during the five-minute call that he try an oral steroid. It worked for Mr. McIntyre, which saved him time and money. But he wonders how many people have that kind of seamless experience. ####  ##### “My fear is what percentage of those people has a Teladoc appointment and then is going back to the doctor anyway?” Mr. McIntyre said. It's that fear, however faint, that still lingers among many insurers as they expand payment for telehealth services. ####  ##### The flip side, advocates argue, is that telehealth will inevitably help patients, even if there is the occasional in-person follow-up. The modality allows physician groups to treat patients outside of traditional hours, and eliminates the costs associated with wasteful travel and wait times. ####  ##### Further, people living in remote regions can receive necessary care they otherwise might not have gotten. ####  ##### “Do we really want to ration care by inconvenience, or do we want to find ways to deliver valuable care as conveniently and inexpensively as possible?” Dr. David Asch, a professor of medicine and medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in an editorial last November for the Annals of Internal Medicine. ####  ##### And that's the rationale that has been winning over payers. “We're underserved in almost every county of the state in most specialties,” Mr. McIntyre said. “If this provides that opportunity for someone to get care they need, then it's a good thing.” ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

That compares with 33 employers with 850,000 employees and dependents who offered coverage through the exchange in 2015. ####  ##### In addition, 75 employers with 400,000 covered lives are participating in an Aon Hewitt exchange for Medicare-eligible retirees this year, up from 50 employers and 350,000 covered lives in 2015. ####  ##### “Our exchange solutions are delivering on their promise of greater choice and competition through a retail marketplace that allows consumers to better match their true health needs and coverage, while helping the organization meet business objectives,” said Mike Christie, senior vice president and head of exchange market strategy at Aon Hewitt in Chicago. ####  ##### The exchange model typically deploys a defined contribution approach in which employers provide a fixed contribution and employees pay more or less for their share of the total premium depending on the level of coverage they choose. Through that approach, an employer can cap what it will pay for health plan coverage for its employees. ####  ##### At the same time, exchanges typically offer employees more health plan choices than their employers previously provided. #### "
"Employers try to cut pension costs by reducing plan size","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Financial Results, Health Care Costs"," ##### Escalating Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. insurance premiums are leading more employers to take steps to reduce the size of their pension plans, according to a new survey. ####  ##### When asked if they intended to change their pension plans due to legislation Congress passed last year sharply raising PBGC premiums over a three-year period, 32% of respondents said they are considering offering participants the option to convert their monthly annuity benefit to a cash lump sum, according to the survey released Tuesday by Boston-based investment consultant NEPC L.L.C. ####  ##### After taking a lump sum, affected individuals no longer are in the pension plan, reducing the so-called flat rate PBGC premium — the total amount based on number of plan participants — paid by employers. ####  ##### In addition, 17% of respondents said they are considering transferring pension benefit obligations to insurers through the purchase of group annuities. ####  ##### That approach also reduces the flat rate PBGC premium and, by reducing plan liabilities, also cuts backs an employer's exposure to the PBGC's variable rate premium, which is based on the amount of plan underfunding. ####  ##### On the other hand, 32% of respondents said that due to higher PBGC premiums, they are considering boosting contributions to their pension plans, reducing or even eliminating the PBGC variable premium they would have paid. ####  ##### Thirty-four percent of respondents, though, said they are not considering plan changes as a result of the higher PBGC premiums. ####  ##### The hike in PBGC premiums “has gotten the attention of plan sponsors,” said Brad Smith, a partner in NEPC's Atlanta office. ####  ##### Under the 2015 law, the current base $64 per participant premium will rise over a three-year period until it hits $80 in 2019, while the variable rate premium — now $30 per $1,000 of plan underfunding — will increase to $41 in 2019. ####  ##### Those rate hikes are supposed to generate an additional $4 billion in premium income for the PBGC through the end of 2025. ####  ##### But if the premium rate leads to more employers reducing the size of their pension plans, that increase in premium income could be much less than projected, Mr. Smith said ####  ##### The NEPC survey, conducted in mid-February is based on the responses of 41 employers, whose pension plans range in size from about $50 million in assets to $7.5 billion in assets, with a median size of about $400 million in plan assets. ####  ##### Responses add up to more than 100% because some respondents who said they were considering making changes selected more than one approach. #### "

Companies reported selling more than 300 separate contracts under $100 million.” ####  ##### Among the buyouts announced in 2015 were Kimberly-Clark Corp., Dallas, which reduced its total liabilities by $2.5 billion with group annuity purchases from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Prudential; and Philips Electronics North America Corp., New York, which purchased group annuity contracts from Prudential, American United Life Insurance Co. and Banner Life Insurance Co. to cut pension obligations by about $1.1 billion. ####  ##### “With PBGC premium increases, market volatility and continued low interest rates, employers are becoming more interested in transferring their pension risk to an insurer … The institute expects this trend to accelerate in the next few years,” Mr. Ericson added. ####  ##### Meaghan Kilroy writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Senate Democrats urge revisiting multiemployer pension law","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee want Congress to take another look at a 2014 federal law that allows financially troubled multiemployer pension plans to cut participants' benefits after receiving regulatory permission, but the panel's Republican chairman is defending the law. ####  ##### Under that law, multiemployer plans, to prevent insolvency, can slash benefits. ####  ##### The driving forces behind the passage of the 2014 law were widespread predictions that the failure of massively underfunded plans would lead, in turn, to the collapse of the PBGC's insurance program. ####  ##### But in a letter released Tuesday, 12 Finance Committee Democrats said the multiemployer pension system “still is in crisis” and that new congressional action is necessary. ####  ##### Citing the PBGC's 2015 annual report, the Democrats' letter, sent to Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, noted that the PBGC's multiemployer pension insurance program has a $52.3 billion deficit and, even with the changes mandated  by the 2014 law, is projected to go broke in about a decade. ####  ##### “The only way to truly address this crisis is to do so on a bipartisan basis,” the letter said. “We need to make sure that we preserve pension benefits that people earned and are counting on to maintain their standard of living in retirement, while ensuring the solvency of the PBGC.” ####  ##### But Sen. Hatch, in a statement released Tuesday at the start of a Finance Committee hearing on the multiemployer pension problem, described the 2014 law as the best available legislative approach. ####  ##### Critics of the law “have to recognize that when dealing with the problem, there were only three choices: bad, worse and worst of all. In 2014, a bipartisan majority in Congress and the president went with bad.  No one is happy with that choice, I suspect, but it was the best option available to us at the time,” Sen. Hatch said. ####  ##### And to those who back a taxpayer-funded bailout of the PBGC's multiemployer insurance program, Sen. Hatch said the likelihood of Congress taking such action is low. ####  ##### “The idea of a PBGC bailout was proposed by unions, employers and multiemployer plans in 2010.  Back then, the House, Senate and White House were all controlled by Democrats, and the proposal got absolutely no traction. I have a hard time seeing how such a proposal could move forward in the current environment,” Sen. Hatch said. ####  ##### . #### "

"Student loan payback schemes attract millennial workers","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Voluntary Benefits"," ##### The small group of employers paying their employees' student loans continues to expand as mounting national student debt keeps workers from saving for retirement or reaching major life milestones, like buying a home. ####  ##### Fidelity Investments, the latest in a string of firms to announce an employee student loan payback program, this week said that 5,000 employees have signed up for the Boston-based financial services firm's student loan assistance program launched in January. ####  ##### New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.C. announced its student loan repayment benefit in September, and Boston-based Natixis Global Asset Management S.A. did so in December. ####  ##### The three financial services companies are a few of the only 3% of employers paying off their workers' student debt, according to the Society of Human Resource Management's most recent employee benefits survey. ####  ##### But some say the number may be set to grow. ####  ##### For one, Tim DeMello, founder and CEO of Boston-based startup Gradifi Inc., said the growth in the interest surrounding student loan repayment benefits is “sort of phenomenal.” ####  ##### “There is huge interest in this,” he said, adding that Gradifi, which helps employers make contributions toward workers' student loan debt, fields between 20 and 25 calls from interested employers each week. ####  ##### The company, which administers PwC's program, has about 100 employers signed up to launch a student loan repayment benefit this year, Mr. DeMello said. ####  ##### The employers Gradifi works with are a mix of sizes and industries, but usually employ a lot of millennial workers, Mr. DeMello said. “The human resources teams know that the workforce by 2020 will be 50% millennials, and they know (student loan debt) will be the No. 1 thing on their minds,” he said. These employers typically contribute about $100 a month toward eligible employees' student debt, he said. ####  ##### According to the Pew Research Center, millennials actually surpassed Generation X in 2015 to become the largest cohort in the U.S. workforce. ####  ##### “The employer gets the benefit of attracting and retaining the employee. So for instance, PwC — when they go out on college campuses they recruit 6,000 people. They are able to offer a program that is different than anybody else,” Mr. DeMello said. ####  ##### Outstanding debt for federal student loans currently stands at $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office. And about 70% of 2014 college graduates had student loan debt, with an average of $28,950 per borrower, according to the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success. ####  ##### Workers who are strapped with debt often have a difficult time saving for retirement in the company 401(k), sources have said. Others may delay major life milestones like buying a house or having a child, Jennifer Hanson, head of associate experience and benefits at Fidelity, said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### “As a financial services firm, this was really concerning to us, and we felt that providing a benefit like student loan repayment assistance helps us to address a very real financial concern that is impacting our employees directly,” she said. ####  ##### Fidelity's Step Ahead Student Loan assistance program provides employees who have been with the company for more than six months $2,000 per year toward their student loans. Eligible participants can receive up to $10,000, according to the company's statement. ####  ##### The benefit is paid monthly, and employees are not required to pay it back if they leave the company, Fidelity said. ####  ##### The firm partners with Santa Monica, California-based Tuition.io to deliver the benefit. ####  ##### “Never before has such a large percentage of the millennial workforce been burdened with levels of debt from their education that have a direct impact on their ability to pay their bills, save for retirement, and stay in the jobs they love,” Tuition.io CEO and founder Brendon McQueen said in an email. “Employers are recognizing that if they want to attract and retain the right talent, they need to start addressing a critical need that faces many of their employees.” ####  ##### Tuition.io works with fewer than 100 employers of different sizes, and employer contributions usually vary from $50 to $200 per month, Mr. McQueen said in the email. ####  ##### The growth at the company “has been incredible,” he said. ####  ##### “There is an inflection point wherein education costs have risen and incomes haven't kept up, which has created the perfect time to introduce a student loan contribution benefit,” he said. #### "
"Florida doctors push back on Aetna-Humana deal","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Insurers"," ##### Following Florida's February approval of the megamerger between Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc., three Florida physician groups on Monday called on the Florida attorney general to reject the merger. ####  ##### In a letter to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the American Medical Association, the Florida Medical Association and the Florida Osteopathic Medical Association said the reduced competition resulting from the merger would negatively affect health care access, quality and affordability in Florida, according to a statement released by the Chicago-based American Medical Association. ####  ##### The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in Tallahassee on Feb. 15 issued a consent order approving Aetna's proposed $37 billion acquisition of Humana on the condition that Aetna expand operations in underserved counties. The Office of Insurance Regulation had previously conducted a survey and found that there was no “strong evidence of an overall significant reduction in the competitive landscape of the private Florida health insurance markets resulting from this proposed merger,” according to the consent order. ####  ##### But the physicians groups say the office relied on “flawed arguments that regulation can substitute for competition,” according to the AMA statement. ####  ##### An AMA analysis released in September found that the proposed Aetna-Humana merger would conflict with federal antitrust guidelines in highly populated metropolitan areas across Florida. According to the AMA, 19 of Florida's metropolitan areas had two health insurers with at least a 50% share of the commercial health insurance market. ####  ##### “Competition, not consolidation, is the right prescription for Florida's health insurance markets,” AMA President-elect Dr. Andrew W. Gurman said in a statement announcing the letter. “Less competition in Florida's already consolidated health insurance markets will lead to price increases, not to greater efficiency or lower health care costs. Given the negative long-term consequences of the proposed merger, any remedy short of rejection would not adequately protect 2.4 million people in Florida,” he said, referring to the number of people covered by the four licensed Humana companies in the state. #### "

"Anthem suit over drug costs may start trend","Benefits Management","Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, General liability"," ##### Anthem Inc.'s lawsuit over pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.'s pricing practices sparks questions about transparency in the PBM industry and what the future may hold for stand-alone PBMs. ####  ##### Indianapolis-based Anthem last week filed a nearly $15 billion lawsuit against St. Louis-based Express Scripts alleging the nation's largest PBM breached its contract with the health insurer by charging higher-than-competitive prices for its services. ####  ##### According to the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Anthem also alleges Express Scripts breached its contract by not performing services in a “prudent and expert manner” and through system defects, inadequate training of workers and a lack of expertise. ####  ##### The suit is the culmination of a monthslong dispute in which Anthem claims it tried unsuccessfully to negotiate lower pricing. ####  ##### Anthem alleges that Express Scripts' pricing exceeds competitive benchmark pricing by more than $3 billion annually, or $13 billion for the rest of Anthem's 10-year contract with Express Scripts, plus $1.8 billion for the time it would take Anthem to ####  ##### transition PBM services once the contract ends in 2019, according to the lawsuit. The overpricing “has resulted in massive damages to Anthem and an obscene profit windfall to (Express Scripts),” Anthem alleges. ####  ##### Express Scripts, on the other hand, has “consistently acted in good faith and in accordance with the terms of its agreement with Anthem,” a spokesman said in an email. “We believe that Anthem's lawsuit is without merit.” ####  ##### PBMs help health insurers process claims, manage retail pharmacy networks and negotiate rebates with drugmakers. Many experts consider PBMs essential for health insurers to score the best prices for drugs. ####  ##### Analysts disagree on the outcome of the dispute. ####  ##### Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. senior research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said in a research note that he believes Anthem and Express Scripts will reach an agreement, as “Anthem's alternative PBM vendor choices are limited.” ####  ##### Meanwhile, Ana Gupte, New York-based managing director and senior research analyst at Leerink Partners L.L.C., said in a report that while “partial pricing relief” for Anthem is likely through the end of the contract, she expects the health insurer to look for another PBM partner beyond 2019. ####  ##### That partner could be OptumRx Inc., a unit of UnitedHealth Group Inc., she said. ####  ##### But losing Anthem could be costly for Express Scripts, said Randy Vogenberg, Greenville, South Carolina-based partner at Access Market Intelligence. ####  ##### “It's a lot of money, and Anthem's a big client for Express Scripts,” he said. ####  ##### According to Fitch Ratings Inc., Anthem accounted for 16.3% of Express Scripts' 2015 sales, or $16.6 billion. The suit also could prompt other Express Scripts clients to question if they're getting the best deal on PBM prices, sources said. ####  ##### “What's going to happen is you could see more of this kind of (legal) activity, where in the past they would just work it out because everybody was making money,” Mr. Vogenberg said. ####  ##### Now, rising health costs, thanks in part to costly specialty drugs, make it necessary to find savings anyway possible, he said. ####  ##### The fact that profits are getting squeezed also means there's a bigger spotlight on the lack of transparency in the PBM industry, Mr. Vogenberg said. ####  ##### The suit may be “the tipping point that will force transparency, certainly, but will also cause change in the way health plans and PBMs and probably (drug) manufacturers do business,” he said of a business that can be “convoluted.” ####  ##### “The lawsuit challenges a fundamental aspect of PBM-insurer relationships: the value of a PBM's negotiating power with pharmaceutical manufacturers,” Fitch said in its report. ####  ##### The increased scale that Anthem will derive from its proposed merger with rival health insurer Cigna Corp. could reduce PBMs' negotiating power relative to the scale of a combined Anthem and Cigna, Fitch said. If Anthem switches to another PBM, that could indicate a stand-alone PBM like Express Scripts isn't “best positioned to pass through cost savings to clients.” ####  ##### Other experts, however, see a future for stand-alone PBMs. ####  ##### “Most people in the industry will tell you that PBMs have staying power. Their clout and leverage will always make them a viable play for employers, regional health plans and even large multistate insurers,” Josh Golden, Atlanta-based practice leader of employer consulting at Pharmaceutical Strategies Group L.L.C., said in an email. ####  ##### Employers and other plan sponsors can learn lessons from the Anthem-Express Scripts dispute, said Craig Oberg, St. Paul, Minnesota-based managing consultant at PBM consultant The Burchfield Group Inc. ####  ##### “This should be an encouragement to all purchasers of PBM services that they should be cautious about long-term agreements and even renewing existing agreements without testing the market,” Mr. Oberg said. #### "

"Opposing sides in Supreme Court ACA contraception case suggest compromise ","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, General liability"," ##### The U.S. Supreme Court may be one step closer to reaching a compromise decision in a case brought by religious not-for-profits that object to helping their employees get contraception coverage as required by the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### The government and the petitioners agreed in briefs Tuesday that a new method could allow not-for-profits' employees to get contraception coverage without involving their employers. But the two sides still don't agree on all the particulars. ####  ##### The briefs were submitted in response to an unusual request from the justices last month to come up with ideas on the matter. ####  ##### The not-for-profits object to an Obama administration workaround that requires them to notify their insurers or the government if they don't want to comply with the contraceptive coverage mandate so other arrangements can be made for their employees. The not-for-profits say requiring them to provide such notification makes them complicit in helping employees get birth control, which violates their religious beliefs. ####  ##### The court's request for suggestions followed oral arguments last month in which the justices seemed divided on the case. If the justices were to split 4-4, the decisions of the lower courts would stand. Eight of nine federal appeals courts have sided with the government. ####  ##### Some experts have suggested that a compromise might be the only way to get a fifth vote at the Supreme Court. ####  ##### Debating alternatives ####  ##### The not-for-profits embraced the idea of an alternative to the workaround. ####  ##### “Yes, there are ways to do this without us,” said Mark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the petitioners in the matter. “If the government does this without us that would solve the religious liberty problem.” ####  ##### The groups suggested that the government could require insurance companies contracting with the religious not-for-profits to offer separate plans to the groups' employees that do include contraception coverage. Those plans could be individual or group and be sponsored by the government, they say. The insurers could contact the groups' employees directly to offer the coverage, keeping the not-for-profits, as organizations, out of it. ####  ##### The groups insist they were never trying to keep birth control out of their employees' hands. Rather, they just didn't want to be involved in helping their employees get such coverage. ####  ##### The groups' message to the government, Rienzi said, is, “You can do whatever you want, but you need to leave me out of it.” ####  ##### In its brief, the government also acknowledged — though less enthusiastically — that alternatives to the current workaround are possible. The government argued that the court should still rule in its favor, not requiring any changes to the current workaround, which it called a “minimally intrusive process that provides clarity.” ####  ##### Still, the government said, the process could change. Instead of requiring notification, the government could tell insurers to automatically offer contraception coverage whenever an employer chooses a plan that does not include such coverage for religious reasons. ####  ##### The court suggested the same strategy in its order last month for alternatives. ####  ##### Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia law professor, said in an e-mail the briefs show “grudging tendentious acceptance from both sides that the court's proposal could work for insured plans.” Mr. Laycock filed a brief in the case siding with the government on behalf of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. ####  ##### The two sides, however, disagree on whether alternative workarounds could be applied to self-insured organizations. ####  ##### The not-for-profits say individuals employed by such organizations that object to the mandate could get contraception coverage by enrolling in separate plans either directly through other insurers or the public insurance exchanges. The government could inform the not-for-profits' employees of the availability of such coverage, contacting them using information from IRS filings, for example. ####  ##### Or the government could require providers to tell the not-for-profit employees about their coverage options, the groups say. ####  ##### The government, meanwhile, says such an alternative would not work for self-insured plans. ####  ##### “This means the court will not be able to announce a solution that both sides will accept,” Mr. Laycock said. “It will actually have to decide the case.” ####  ##### Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois at Urbana, said the court seems to genuinely be searching for a compromise. ####  ##### “I think they're really trying to thread the needle down the middle and find a way for the religious objectors to be left off the hook without deeply upsetting the structure the government has come up with to accommodate those very same people,” Ms. Fretwell Wilson said. ####  ##### The sides are supposed to reply next week to the briefs filed Tuesday. A decision in the case may come as late as June. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Edison utility wins dismissal of lawsuit over 401(k) plan","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, Risk Management, Energy, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by Edison International employees in California who accused the utility of favoring higher-cost mutual funds over lower-cost ones in its retirement plan, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling backing the workers. ####  ##### The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said that while the Supreme Court in May 2015 ruled that federal law imposes an ongoing duty to monitor investments on fiduciaries like Edison, the workers failed to raise that argument in lower courts. ####  ##### The Supreme Court decision, which revived the Edison case and sent it back to the 9th Circuit, will likely make it easier for 401(k) plan participants to sue their employers for choosing investments that impose excessive fees, especially when those decisions were made years before lawsuits are filed. ####  ##### But the 9th Circuit on Wednesday said that before reaching the Supreme Court, Edison employees argued merely that changes to their plan triggered a duty to monitor, and not that the obligation was ongoing, so they could not make that claim now. ####  ##### The case concerned exactly when the role of a retirement plan administrator in monitoring a plan's performance can trigger liability under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. ####  ##### The plaintiffs and Edison agreed there was a duty to monitor, but disagreed over what that entailed. ####  ##### Employees filed suit against Edison subsidiary Southern California Edison Co., which said in a statement that Wednesday's ruling reflected the company's efforts to act in the best interests of 401(k) plan participants. ####  ##### Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### The employees argued the company breached its fiduciary duty by, among other things, offering higher-cost mutual funds to plan participants despite the fact that identical lower-cost funds were available. ####  ##### The main legal issue was whether some of the lawsuit's claims were barred by a six-year statute of limitations under ERISA. The Supreme Court said liability is triggered by the fiduciary's ongoing role monitoring the plan's performance, so the six-year clock routinely resets. ####  ##### In 2010, a federal judge in California said the claims against Edison were barred. The 9th Circuit agreed in a 2013 decision that the high court last year overturned. #### "

"Cost of common health care procedures vary widely by locale","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### The cost of more than 200 health care procedures, such as knee replacements and pregnancy ultrasound tests, varies enormously by geography, according to a new study ####  ##### The study, published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found huge price differences from state to state, as well as among cities in the same state. ####  ##### For example, in Sacramento, California, the average cost of knee replacement surgery in 2015 was $57,504. By contrast, in Riverside, California, the average cost for the same procedure was $30,261, a more than $27,000 difference. ####  ##### Big cost differences also were found for much less costly procedures. For example, pregnancy ultrasounds tests were the highest in San Francisco, averaging $661 in 2015. The lowest average cost for the procedure was in Orlando, Florida: $180, or $481 less than in San Francisco. ####  ##### While some of the cost variations may be the result of differences in rent or wages, “the remaining variation is most likely due to differences in underlying market dynamics, such as varying market power, a lack of transparency, or the availability of alternative treatments,” according to the study. ####  ##### But the study authors said more research is necessary to identify forces that drive prices. ####  ##### The study was conducted by researchers at the Health Care Cost Institute in Washington and Stephen Parente, an associate dean and professor of finance at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. #### "
"Express Scripts CEO open to drug pricing talks with Anthem — within reason","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### The CEO of Express Scripts Holding Co. on Monday said he is “confident” in the company's lawsuit against insurer Anthem Inc., but remains “open to conversations” with Anthem to solve the dispute over drug pricing. ####  ##### “We want to make clear that we are confident that we have negotiated in good faith, are fulfilling our contractual obligations, (and) are providing excellent service to both Anthem and its members,” Express Scripts Chairman and CEO George Paz said during a conference call Monday with investment analysts. ####  ##### Last month, Indianapolis-based Anthem filed a nearly $15 billion lawsuit against St. Louis-based Express Scripts alleging the pharmacy benefit manager's pricing exceeds competitive benchmark pricing by more than $3 billion annually. But last week, Express Scripts fired back with a lawsuit of its own claiming that Anthem in fact “has failed to negotiate in good faith,” the lawsuit reads. ####  ##### Mr. Paz told investment analysts that Express Scripts' “legal case is strong” and the company intends to continue working with Anthem long-term, but the lawsuit will likely be “a long, drawn-out situation.” ####  ##### “We believe we are Anthem's best PBM option, delivering great care, keeping drug costs in check and helping to grow their business. We are currently collaborating with them to implement solutions, and we are proud of the results we are helping Anthem to achieve,” Mr. Paz said. ####  ##### “We have nothing but intention to continue to do a great job for them, to position ourselves well to be a choice that they want to make at some period of time in the future when we get this behind us,” Express Scripts President and Director Timothy Wentworth said during the conference call. ####  ##### “The reality is, at any point we're always open to conversations,” Mr. Paz said. “If (Anthem) want(s) to come in and have a conversation that's reasonable in nature — nothing to do with $3 billion, that's pretty ludicrous, you've heard me say that before — we're open to that.” #### "
"Health insurer execs reap massive rewards in deal-heavy 2015","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### UnitedHealth Group Inc. CEO Stephen Hemsley earned $14.5 million in 2015, according to a filing Friday, but he wasn't the top-earning health insurance executive. ####  ##### The highest-paid CEO in 2015 was Michael Neidorff of Centene Corp., a national Medicaid insurer. He earned $20.8 million. That does not include the millions of dollars worth of unvested or unsold Centene stock that Mr. Neidorff owns. ####  ##### Mr. Neidorff and the heads of several other publicly traded health insurers recorded larger cash bonuses and richer stock awards in 2015, a time that was defined by massive mega-mergers but also tumult in the Affordable Care Act's new insurance exchanges. ####  ##### The pay packages for CEOs of seven of the eight largest insurers went up from 2014 to 2015, according to a review of the companies' annual proxy statements. Together, the CEOs of the eight major insurance companies made approximately $112 million in salaries, stock awards and options, bonuses and other compensation. The higher pay reflected the companies' rising stock prices that were fueled partially by a rush of mergers and acquisitions. ####  ##### Centene completed its $6 billion deal for Health Net in March after a protracted review from California regulators. The acquisition opened up Centene to bigger plays in Medicare Advantage and the ACA exchanges, and it fortified the company's position as one of the largest, most powerful Medicaid insurers in the country. The company cited Mr. Neidorff's role in the Health Net deal, along with Centene's increased profitability, as the major reasons for his $3.6 million cash bonus. ####  ##### After Mr. Neidorff, Cigna Corp. CEO David Cordani was the next highest in compensation, followed closely by Aetna Inc. CEO Mark Bertolini. Mr. Cordani made a little more than $17.3 million, and Mr. Bertolini made just less than that total. Mr. Cordani agreed to sell Cigna to Anthem Inc. last summer in a deal valued at more than $54 billion, making it the largest in the history of health insurance. Mr. Bertolini orchestrated Aetna's $37 billion purchase of Medicare-dominant Humana Inc. right before the Anthem-Cigna deal. ####  ##### Mr. Cordani could make $82 million if he leaves Anthem within two years of the merger closing, although he made it clear last year that he wants to be Joseph Swedish's successor at Anthem. However, Anthem has not guaranteed Mr. Cordani the corner office when Mr. Swedish retires. Mr. Swedish made $13.6 million in 2015, and his pay didn't suffer even though he was in charge during the nation's largest health care data breach, which was brought to light in February 2015 and has resulted in several legal cases. ####  ##### Mr. Hemsley, the longtime CEO of UnitedHealth, was the only one of the eight top insurance executives who recorded lower pay in 2015, albeit his compensation was down just slightly. UnitedHealth's proxy filing shows that Mr. Hemsley asked the board's compensation committee to revise his bonus and total pay downward, “even though the board believes his performance has been outstanding.” ####  ##### Mr. Hemsley still holds an immensely valuable portion of UnitedHealth. He has more than 3.2 million outstanding shares of UnitedHealth's stock, which was worth about $430 million as of April 22. ####  ##### UnitedHealth was pummeled by the ACA's exchanges, announcing last week that it expected to lose more than $1 billion in 2015 and 2016 and therefore would pull out of most of the 34 states in which it sells ACA plans. But Mr. Hemsley and the company still closed several acquisitions of its own, including a $13 billion takeover of Catamaran Corp., which significantly grew UnitedHealth's Optum Inc. pharmacy division. ####  ##### Molina Healthcare CEO Dr. J. Mario Molina recorded $10.3 million in total compensation, and WellCare Health Plans CEO Ken Burdick took home $7.8 million in his first full year at the helm. Both companies made a few small-scale acquisitions. ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Coalition seeks prescription to cure rising drug prices ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### A coalition of health care providers, employers, health insurers and consumer groups on Monday proposed several policy changes aimed at tackling the rising cost of prescription drugs. ####  ##### The proposed reforms to the “broken prescription drug market” focus on increasing transparency, encouraging competition in the marketplace, and driving greater value for patients and payers, the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing said in a statement. ####  ##### The Washington-based coalition is a project of the nonprofit National Coalition on Health Care Action Fund. ####  ##### The proposals come as U.S. spending on health care hit $3.0 trillion in 2014, driven in part by exorbitant prescription drug costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Prescription drug spending grew 12.2% in 2014 to $297.7 billion due to costly specialty drugs, like those used to treat hepatitis C, and brand-name drug price increases, according to CMS. ####  ##### The coalition proposed requiring drugmakers to disclose a drug's unit price, the cost of a full course of treatment and a projection of federal spending on the drug. The coalition also suggested requiring drugmakers to release the true cost of research and development for a drug, as well as annually report increases in the drug's price. ####  ##### In recent months, drugmakers' pricing practices have gone under the microscope, touched off by last year's news that drugmaker Turing Pharmaceuticals raised a decades-old generic drug's price overnight to $750 a pill from $13.50. Since then, a national debate has surged over whether the expensive prices set by pharmaceutical companies are arbitrary or necessary for innovation. ####  ##### One way to bring down drug prices is to increase competition in the market, the campaign said. The coalition called for speeding up generic drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, noting that the FDA has a backlog of nearly 4,000 generic drug applications while securing approval can take three years. ####  ##### Incentives should also be used to drive competition for expensive drugs that have no alternatives, the coalition said. ####  ##### The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing also urged that exclusivity protections should only be used for new and innovative drugs. ####  ##### Finally, the coalition said policymakers should increase funding for research on drug pricing and value, expand value-based pricing in public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and require drugmakers to provide comparisons of costs and outcomes with other similar drugs so doctors and patients can choose their treatments wisely. ####  ##### “The drug companies must recognize that they are part of this larger health system and that their pricing decisions affect individuals, families, governments and purchasers. The specific policy proposals put forward by the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing are important first steps towards lowering prescription drug prices in the United States,” Bernard J. Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente, said in the coalition's statement. ####  ##### “Everyone in the industry needs to work toward solutions that help people get the medicine they need at a price that is affordable and sustainable,” Jim DuCharme, president and CEO of Prime Therapeutics, said in the statement. “As the only pharmacy benefit manager that's a member of (the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing), Prime is working with coalition members to drive more competition, transparency, and value as those strategies can close the big gaps in today's health care system that are fueling out-of-control drug prices.” #### "
"Ruling on cost-sharing subsidies could rattle insurers in midst of rate-setting","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, UnitedHealth Group, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Another bombshell could soon drop on the Affordable Care Act insurance exchange market, and it might come at a highly vulnerable moment for the health care reform law. ####  ##### Rosemary Collyer, U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia, is expected to soon issue her ruling in U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, a case in which House Republicans claim the Obama administration is illegally funding the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies without a congressional appropriation. ####  ##### If, as some legal observers believe is possible or even likely, the George W. Bush-nominated Judge Collyer decides against the administration, it would further rattle insurers who are facing multiple difficulties in the exchange business. UnitedHealth Group Inc. announced last week that it was pulling out of most exchanges because of its financial losses. Such a ruling would be a shock, even though it surely would be appealed, and the case could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### Legal briefs in the case were filed in January, and observers say the ruling is already overdue. ####  ##### “I suspect it would be a pretty big perceived risk, and (insurers') stocks would be negatively affected,” said Jeffrey Loo, a health care equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. ####  ##### If Judge Collyer — who previously startled experts by finding that the plaintiffs had standing to sue over a political dispute — rules that the funding of the subsidies is illegal, it would inject major uncertainty into the market just as insurers and their actuaries are calculating 2017 premiums for the individual and small-group markets. Insurers have to file their rates for plans sold on the federal insurance exchange by May 11. Most state rate-filing deadlines also are in May, including deadlines for big states such as California, Florida, New York and Texas, although some state deadlines fall in April or June. ####  ##### “It would create more volatility, and it would thin out the chances of (the exchange business) being a profitable program for insurers,” said David Axene, president of Axene Health Partners, a consulting and actuary firm. ####  ##### “I worry that (Collyer) will release her decision right as the plans are filing their 2017 rates and further upset an already worried market,” said Tim Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee University who supports the ACA. ####  ##### Judge Collyer increased speculation that she will find the subsidy funding illegal when she recently overruled the administration's assertion of federal oversight of MetLife Inc., blasting regulators for using a process she called “fatally flawed.” ####  ##### The MetLife ruling “indicates a lack of deference to the administration,” Mr. Jost said. ####  ##### Under the ACA, the federal government is projected to spend $175 billion over 10 years to reduce deductibles, co-pays and coinsurance costs for people with incomes under 250% of the poverty level who enroll in silver plans. The law states that health plans must reduce cost-sharing for those enrollees, and that HHS must pay plans for the value of the cost reductions. ####  ##### Nearly 60% of exchange plan members receive cost-sharing reductions through silver plans. Without the subsidies, the exchange plans' high deductibles and cost sharing would make health care unaffordable for many low-income people, and some likely would drop coverage. ####  ##### A January report by the Urban Institute projected that if the government is required to halt its payments to insurers for the cost-sharing reductions, insurers would boost their premiums for silver plans by an average of $1,040 and exchange enrollment would decrease by 1 million people. Depending on the timing, insurers “may leave the marketplaces in response to the continued litigation and associated policy changes, the lack of predictability such changes create, and the costs such changes impose on insurers,” the authors wrote. ####  ##### Mr. Axene said if the House v. Burwell ruling causes premiums to go up, some healthier people would drop coverage, while sicker people would find ways to keep their coverage, creating a more expensive enrolled population. ####  ##### A ruling that would block the federal subsidy payments would come on top of a number of other tough challenges insurers and the exchanges face in 2017, Mr. Axene said. Those include sicker-than-expected enrollees, rising prescription drug costs, the termination of the federal-reinsurance and risk-corridor programs that buffer plans against high-cost enrollees, and insurance industry concerns that the CMS' risk-adjustment program is hurting them more than it's helping. Mr. Axene predicted that combination of factors could cause insurers to seek premium increases of 15% or more. ####  ##### “Everyone is frantically running around trying to produce rates,” Mr. Axene said. “I'm not sure (the House v. Burwell case) is what people are really worried about. But it's another thing eroding the effectiveness of the program.” ####  ##### Harris Meyer writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Costco changes stance on pension; Teamsters recommend new contract","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits"," ##### (Reuters) — Teamsters unions representing 16,000 workers of Costco Wholesale Corp. on Tuesday recommended their members approve a new contract offer from the retailer that they said would secure larger pension contributions throughout an employee's career. ####  ##### The new offer came after the union members, which represent about 8% of the retailer's global workforce, rejected an earlier proposal that would not have extended coverage in the defined benefit pension plan to non-participating employees. ####  ##### The new agreement allows those employees — about 4,000 on the East Coast on a 401(k) plan — to join the other roughly 12,000 in California in their defined benefit plan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said on Tuesday. ####  ##### The breakthrough comes as a tight U.S. labor market prompts retailers to improve pay and benefits. Reuters reported on Monday that Target Corp. was lifting its minimum hourly pay by $1 to $10, its second hike in a year and following a similar bump by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ####  ##### Without disclosing details, the Teamsters said that language and economic changes allowed it to reverse position and recommend the offer. Ratification would conclude a 12-year push to make the pension change, the head negotiator said. ####  ##### The new plan “means more money being contributed especially throughout an employee's career,” Rome Aloise told Reuters. “The way the Costco plan works is the longer you are there the more you get, which is what they believe in: That you get rewarded for your longevity.” ####  ##### Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### Costco has a reputation as a good employer with relatively high wages, standing out in a retail industry that faces criticism from labor activists for not paying workers enough to make ends meet. ####  ##### But Costco had characterized the initial, rejected proposal as its “last, best and final offer,” the union said last month. ####  ##### When asked why Costco changed its mind even though the new agreement could increase costs, Mr. Aloise said he believed the company came to understand how important the pension was to the workers. “Costco is a rare company,” he said. ####  ##### West Coast union members will likely vote on the contract in early May and East Coast members in June, Mr. Aloise said. ####  ##### In its latest annual report, Costco said it had 205,000 employees globally, all nonunion with the exception of those represented by the Teamsters. It said it considered its employee relations to be very good. #### "
"Treasury denies Central States' bid to cut pension benefits","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### In a major victory for multiemployer pension plan participants, the U.S. Treasury on Friday denied an application by the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund to slash benefits for hundreds of thousands of plan members. ####  ##### The move could spare 272,600 participants of the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund from proposed benefit reductions. ####  ##### “Today I notified the Central States Pension plan that its application to reduce pension benefits to hundreds of thousands of retirees was denied because the application that was submitted did not meet the requirements of federal law, the Kline-Miller statute, that governs Treasury's evaluation and analysis of all such private multiemployer pension plans,” Kenneth Feinberg, special master for the Treasury Department's implementation of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, said during a conference call with media on Friday. ####  ##### “We at Treasury have worked closely with the PGBC and the Department of Labor over the past many months to review the application in its entirety. It is unanimous that the application fails to meet the statutory prerequisites,” he said. ####  ##### In a statement Friday, the Central States Pension Fund said it is disappointed with Treasury's decision and will “carefully consider the most appropriate next steps.” Among them, the plan could reapply and propose larger cuts. ####  ##### “Although the decision by our trustees to file this application under provisions of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 was gut-wrenching, we are disappointed with Treasury's decision, as we believe the rescue plan provided the only realistic solution to avoiding insolvency,” the pension fund said. ####  ##### “While today's decision by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to deny Central States Pension Fund's rescue plan will temporarily spare many from cuts to their hard-earned benefits in the short-term, it also sentences participants to an insecure retirement where massive benefit cuts are inevitable,” Randy G. DeFrehn, Executive Director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, said in a statement Friday. ####  ##### The national Teamsters union applauded the decision. ####  ##### “On behalf of our union and the more than 400,000 retirees and participants in Central States Pension Fund, I would like to thank Mr. Feinberg and the Department of Treasury for denying these massive cuts that would destroy so many lives. We worked with thousands of retirees to educate Treasury and Congress on the devastating impact of the proposed cuts,” Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa said in a statement. “This decision means that there won't be any cuts to retirees' pensions this July or the foreseeable future. We will find a solution to this problem that will allow members and retirees to continue to retire with dignity.” ####  ##### The Central States' application was denied for three reasons, Mr. Feinberg said: It failed to show that the proposed benefit cuts would prevent the plan from becoming insolvent. It also failed to demonstrate that the reduction would be “equitably distributed among the retiree population,” Mr. Feinberg said. ####  ##### Finally, the notice sent to the pension plan participants announcing the proposed cuts was not “readily understandable,” but was instead “technical” and “overly complex,” Mr. Feinberg said. ####  ##### The Treasury on Friday sent letters to the Central States Pension Fund and members of the U.S. House of Representatives, announcing the decision. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg also cautioned that the Treasury's decision pertains only to the Central States' application, and “is not to say that other private multiemployer plans that might be submitted to Treasury pursuant to this law will meet a similar result.” ####  ##### Five additional applications by other pension funds seeking to reduce benefits under the Kline-Miller law have been submitted, according to the Treasury's website. ####  ##### In September, the Central States Pension Fund filed the proposal with the Treasury Department to cut the benefits received by 272,600 of the plan's more than 400,000 participants. ####  ##### If approved, the cuts would have been allowed under a 2014 federal law meant to prevent the collapse of financially troubled plans and a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. insurance program that guarantees a portion of participants' promised but unfunded benefits. ####  ##### At the end of 2014, the Central States pension plan had $35 billion in liabilities and just $17.8 billion in assets. ####  ##### The Treasury Department had until May 7 to act on the Central States plan to cut benefits. #### "

"Kroger, UPS sue over Central States reduction plan ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Regulation, Retirement Benefits, General liability"," ##### A pending plan to cut benefits to members as part of a rescue plan for the Teamsters Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Rosemont, Illinois, is facing challenges even before the U.S. Treasury Department acts on the fund's application. ####  ##### Current and former plan participants of Kroger Co., Cincinnati, last week sued the $17.8 billion Teamsters Central States over the rescue plan. And United Parcel Service Inc., a former participating employer, challenged the legality of the rescue plan, which would enable the fund to reduce benefits, including those of current retirees. ####  ##### The Treasury Department is expected to rule early this month on the rescue plan. ####  ##### Current and former Kroger participants sued Central States April 25 because the participants want to leave the plan and start a new one before the Treasury Department acts on the pension fund's benefit reduction proposal. ####  ##### UPS, Atlanta, argued in an April 28 earnings presentation that the benefit reduction application by the Teamsters Central States is not legal. ####  ##### The Kroger case plaintiffs, current and retired warehouse workers for Kroger Co., filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Chicago, arguing that Central States trustees' refusing to consider an additional plan is a breach of fiduciary duty because it harms participants. ####  ##### The Teamsters union negotiated a proposal to remove Kroger participants from Central States and create a new plan for Kroger employees, with the company agreeing to absorb the increased withdrawal liability, according to the federal court complaint. ####  ##### Because Central States trustees “flatly refused to consider” after deliberating for just five days, the plaintiffs are asking the court to order reconsideration of the proposal, to appoint an independent fiduciary to judge the idea and to negotiate an arrangement with Kroger. ####  ##### If that doesn't happen before the existing proposal expires June 15, “the Kroger participants will be trapped in a plan that is about to cut their benefits and still faces likely insolvency,” the court complaint said. ####  ##### Thomas Nyhan, executive director and general counsel at the Central States pension fund, said in an e-mailed statement that the claims by Kroger and the Teamsters union “are without merit. As fiduciaries, Central States' trustees have a duty to safeguard the retirement benefits of all of our 407,000 participants — not a select few from a particular employer. Central States is prepared to defend against this complaint, and we are confident that Central States will prevail by demonstrating that the trustees' actions are consistent with their fiduciary duties.” ####  ##### UPS, which in 2007 withdrew from the Central States pension fund as part of a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, might be required to pay $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion in benefit payments if the pending benefit reduction application is approved by the Treasury Department. ####  ##### A “backstop agreement” in the 2007 bargaining agreement stated that in the event “at some point in the future if Central States ever lawfully cut benefits to that group, UPS would provide a supplemental retiree benefit” only to its participants, UPS spokesman Steve Gaut said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### The Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 requires the Treasury Department to approve an application if a pension fund's potential claims would cost the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. $1 billion or more. The Central States pension fund applied for the rescue plan in September with the Treasury Department. The pension fund is projected to become insolvent in 2025. ####  ##### The Treasury Department's decision is expected on or before May 7. ####  ##### Mr. Gaut said UPS also believes the benefit reductions laid out in the application are not legal. The MPRA imposed a tiered benefit reduction process specifically for the Central States plan. UPS argues that the benefit reduction application disproportionally affects participants in the third tier, which comprises the UPS participants. ####  ##### “The ordering rule that's laid out in the (act) would indicate that there should be a progressive reduction of benefits starting at Tier I, then moving to Tier II then moving to Tier III,” Mr. Gaut said. ####  ##### According to UPS, the average benefit reduction for Tier III participants is 53%, compared to 34% for Tier I participants and 29% for Tier II participants. ####  ##### According to a January paper from the Congressional Research Service, Tier I includes benefits for participants that worked for employers that withdrew from the Central States fund without making the payments required to fully exit the plan and Tier III consists of the benefits for the UPS participants. Tier II consists of participants not in either other group. There are 100,377 Tier I participants, 322,560 Tier II participants, and 48,249 Tier III participants. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford and Rob Kozlowski write for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"It's back to the drawing board for multiemployer pension reform","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The result of the first test of a new multiemployer pension reform law has left trustees of the Central States Teamsters pension fund reeling, other troubled multiemployer pension fund officials uncertain about their options, and some politicians feeling the pressure to step in. ####  ##### The U.S. Treasury Department on May 6 denied the benefit suspension application of the $17.8 billion Teamsters Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Rosemont, Illinois, citing three unmet criteria of the Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, which created the suspension process and put Treasury in charge. ####  ##### “If there's one good thing that has come out of this, it is that Congress now knows they have to go back and roll up their sleeves. It really is going to define this country,” said Teamsters International Vice President John Murphy in an interview. ####  ##### Treasury Special Master Kenneth Feinberg, in a press call, said, “We found there were fatal flaws in this submission.” ####  ##### Treasury officials found that the Teamsters' suspension plan did not distribute benefit cuts equitably and did not provide participants with easily understood notices — but above all, it would not avoid insolvency. ####  ##### The top reason for that, Mr. Feinberg said in a letter to the pension fund's board of trustees, were the actuarial assumptions used to support the pension fund's claim. The plan's 7.5% rate of investment return and entry age assumptions were too optimistic for a plan that at the time of its September 2015 application was 53% funded, with $35 billion in liabilities and likely insolvency by 2026, Mr. Feinberg said in the letter. For a plan in that shape, he wrote, using a common return assumption of 7.5% over a 50-year time horizon didn't fly because it failed to give enough weight to near-term expected rates of return that would have led to “materially different results,” or to negative cash flow problems likely to reduce asset levels even further, among other reasons. ####  ##### The demographic assumptions, Treasury officials said, should likewise have been refined to reflect the plan's cash flow and current data. ####  ##### That could have a chilling effect on other distressed plans considering MPRA. ####  ##### Scrutinizing assumptions ####  ##### Treasury's denial of the Central States application “does make clear that they are going to scrutinize the assumptions. That might change the ability for plans to make the case,” said Jean-Pierre Aubry, associate director of state and local research with the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, which identified 100 plans that could be eligible to apply for MPRA reductions, based on 2013 plan data. ####  ##### Central States Executive Director Thomas Nyhan defended the plan's calculations, which he said were “middle of the road and reasonable,” noting the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called them too optimistic, and a major employer, United Parcel Service Inc., Atlanta, called them too pessimistic. ####  ##### “Treasury is demanding a measure of actuarial precision that is not available,” Mr. Nyhan said in a press call following the application's denial, which he called “heart- and gut-wrenching.” ####  ##### As Central States trustees regroup to decide whether to appeal the decision or prepare a new application, the only certainty for plan participants at this point is the money for benefits will run out by 2026 at the latest, he said. ####  ##### “We hope the people who urged rejection will come forward now and seek solutions,” said Mr. Nyhan, who puts members of Congress at the top of that list. “Now is the moment for them to step to the plate and provide the funds. The time for rhetoric has passed; the moment for action is now.” ####  ##### Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew echoed that call in a letter announcing the decision to leaders of the Senate Finance and Health Education Labor and Pension committees. Since Central States filed the first MPRA application, “many stakeholders, including members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, have recognized the harshness of the cuts needed,” Mr. Lew said, but the law does not allow Treasury to consider alternatives. ####  ##### With the ball now back in Congress' court, “finding a balanced solution will require painful choices,” said Mr. Lew. ####  ##### “There's a lesson for Congress here,” agreed Mr. Murphy of the Teamsters. “I know there is a recognition by a lot of members of Congress that the multiemployer pension system is in very serious trouble and there has to be some kind of solution that does not include reducing the income of senior citizens. If we can keep this issue on the front burner ... I think we can come up with some creative solutions. ####  ##### “For this problem to be solved, we have to come up with a new source of funding for financially stressed pension funds,” said Mr. Murphy, who predicted some ideas will come forth in the next few months. ####  ##### Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a critic of the MPRA, said in a statement supporting the decision by the Treasury that “there are no easy answers here, and Congress needs to work harder on a bipartisan basis to develop other solutions.” ####  ##### MPRA's co-author, House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minn., who is retiring this year, has pledged to continue working on legislation to strengthen the multiemployer system. Randy DeFrehn, executive director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, Washington, whose multiemployer pension reform ideas led to passage of the MPRA, supports the application process as a way to avoid deeper cuts in the long run for plans without options. ####  ##### Not betting on Congress ####  ##### Mr. DeFrehn is not betting on Congress right away. “Congress has had many opportunities to provide assistance (but) they have chosen not to do so and it is unlikely they will,” he said in an email. He is more optimistic about legislation now before Mr. Kline's committee that would revisit withdrawal liability and allow for composite plans with both defined benefit and defined contribution features, which he said has broad bipartisan support. ####  ##### “Chairman Kline has said that passing this is his top legislative priority. So barring any unforeseen legislative event, this may be one of the few pieces of legislation that can be passed this year,” Mr. DeFrehn said. “We hope that some way can be found to support the multiemployer defined benefit system and those who, through no fault of their own, now face a much less secure retirement than they had been promised.” ####  ##### Sweeping solutions are not expected in an election year, particularly one that could change the balance of power in Congress. MPRA critics, including the Pension Rights Center in Washington and AARP, realize their victory in the Central States decision is short-lived, as many troubled multiemployer plans head toward insolvency, along with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s multiemployer insurance program itself. ####  ##### Four other plans — the $92 million Iron Workers Local 17 Pension Fund, Cleveland; the $123 million Teamsters Local 469 Pension Plan, Hazlet, New Jersey; the $86 million Iron Workers Local Union 16, Towson, Maryland; and the $27.8 million Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, Hempstead, New York — also have filed for benefit suspensions. The Pension Rights Center identified 52 multiemployer plans that have notified the U.S. Department of Labor of their “critical and declining” status, which allows them to consider applying for MPRA relief. ####  ##### “It's not a rosy picture at all,” said Mr. Aubry with the Center for Retirement Research, who noted the funding deficits in multiemployer plans are collectively smaller than for public-sector plans, which are short by an estimated $1 trillion, and in the private sector. ####  ##### If the MPRA is not an option and Congress doesn't find the political will and significant sources of money to rescue ailing multiemployer plans or the PBGC, it will be up to pension fund trustees to figure out which painful steps to take, he said. “That's the conversation that has to be had now. It's a difficult conversation to have.” ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Justice Department will appeal decision in Affordable Care Act case ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Political Risk, General liability, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### The Department of Justice will appeal a judge's ruling that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally funding part of the Affordable Care Act, a department spokesman confirmed Friday. ####  ##### The announcement was expected. It follows a federal judge's decision Thursday to side with House Republicans in their lawsuit against the administration. ####  ##### House Republicans alleged in that lawsuit that the administration illegally spent money that Congress never appropriated for the ACA's cost-sharing provisions. Those provisions include reduced deductibles, copayments and coinsurance many Americans receive, depending on income, for plans purchased through the ACA's insurance exchanges. ####  ##### About 56% of Americans who receive coverage through ACA's insurance exchanges — about 5.6 million people — got cost-sharing reductions as of June 2015, according to the CMS. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who made the decision, stayed her ruling pending an appeal, so her decision won't go into effect as long as the matter is on appeal. ####  ##### That means the decision won't likely affect insurance rate-setting or participation for 2017, though it does create some uncertainty in the long run for insurers. Shares for four of the nation's major insurers and a number of large hospital chains all dropped Thursday. ####  ##### If the ruling were to be upheld by the appeals court and/or the U.S. Supreme Court, it might lead insurers to raise their premiums to compensate for the lost money. That, in turn, would likely trigger an increase in tax credits the government now allows Americans to help them afford their premiums. ####  ##### Another possibility if Congress refused to appropriate the money is that insurers would seek relief in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Yet another possible outcome is that Congress would start appropriating the money each year. That, however, could complicate insurers' annual rate-setting process because they often have to set rates before the appropriations process concludes, said Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. ####  ##### Legal experts agree that the appeals court will likely closely examine the issue of whether House Republicans even have standing to sue the administration. Judge Collyer surprised many last year when she ruled that House Republicans did have standing to sue. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Tennessee Valley Authority OKs partial freeze of cash balance plan ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The board of the Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement System, Knoxville, approved a compromise proposal from the TVA staff and its board of directors that would partially freeze its cash balance pension fund and move some current employees to the 401(k) plan effective Oct. 1, a TVA spokesman said. ####  ##### The TVA board of directors had issued the compromise proposal April 18 in response to a retirement system board counterproposal March 3 that altered an original December proposal to freeze the plan and move all participants to the 401(k) plan. The TVARS board’s March 3 counterproposal moves only participants with less than 10 years of service to the existing 401(k) plan. TVA would contribute 6% of an employee’s salary and then match 100% of employee contributions up to 6% of salary. ####  ##### The April 18 compromise proposal approved by the retirement system board Monday adopts those tenets of the counterproposal and also includes minor changes that do not alter basic components of the counterproposal. The board will now draw up the language of amendments to retirement system’s rules, which are scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1, and submit them to the TVA board of directors. ####  ##### The changes will take effect unless the board of directors vetoes them within 30 days of the receipt of the amendments. ####  ##### The cash balance pension plan was established for employees hired on or after Jan. 1, 1996, and closed to new hires on July 1, 2014. The original staff proposal in December froze the plan and moved all participants to the 401(k) plan. ####  ##### Those with 10 years or more of service would receive 3% of pay credits on future earnings to their cash balance accounts; they currently receive 6%. The participants would then receive a 3% automatic contribution to their 401(k) accounts in addition to the current employer match of 75% of employee contributions up to 6% of pay. Thus, the potential TVA contribution to their 401(k) accounts would rise to 7.5% from 4.5%. ####  ##### TVA will contribute the greater of $300 million per year or the minimum required contribution over the next 20 years to the cash balance plan or until it’s fully funded. ####  ##### As of Sept. 30, pension fund assets totaled $6.8 billion, and projected benefit obligations totaled $12.8 billion, for a funding ratio of 53.1%, according to TVA’s most recent 10-K filing. The 401(k) plan has $1.9 billion in assets. ####  ##### Rob Kozlowski writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Hospital agrees to funnel millions into pension plan to settle litigation","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Another hospital has agreed to settle for $107 million in what's become a growing list of cases over whether faith-based health systems have to follow federal rules meant to protect employee pensions. ####  ##### Carol Kemp-DeLisser, the pension participant who filed the class-action case, alleged that St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, owned by Trinity Health Corp., wrongly classified its pension plan as a ""church plan."" Church plans are not subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which protects employees by requiring that pension plans be insured and sufficiently funded. Kemp-DeLisser alleged that St. Francis failed to adhere to ERISAs minimum finding standards. ####  ##### St. Francis, however, argued that because it is associated with and controlled by the Catholic Church, its pension plan is a church plan, exempt from ERISA. ####  ##### As part of the settlement, the Hartford, Conn., hospital has agreed to pour another $17 million into its employee pension following settlement approval. It will then contribute another $10 million a year for nine years. St. Francis denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement and maintains that its pension plan is a church plan exempt from ERISA. ####  ##### St. Francis said in a statement that it, “remains committed to ensuring our retirees and their beneficiaries receive their benefits under all of our retirement plans.” It noted that its plan remains a church plan. ####  ##### “As intended, the plan has paid benefits in full to our retirees and will continue to do so into the future,” the hospital said in the statement. “The lawsuit was resolved by committing to fund the plan in a manner consistent with what St. Francis has done in the past and intends to do in the future.” ####  ##### St. Francis also noted in court documents that part of the rationale for exempting church-affiliated plans from ERISA was to separate church and state. ####  ##### The case is one of many similar across the country. As of March, about a dozen such cases had been filed and more are expected. ####  ##### Ascension Health settled after a district court judge sided with the health system, finding that “a plan need not be established by a church in order to qualify as a church plan.” ####  ##### And at least two federal appeals courts have weighed in on the issue. In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit ruled that Advocate Health Care's pension plan is not a church plan simply because the health system is religiously affiliated. In December, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against St. Peter's Healthcare System in New Jersey. ####  ##### District courts have been somewhat divided on the issue. For example, a district court judge recently partially granted a motion to dismiss a case filed against Trinity Health, saying an organization “controlled by or associated with a church or a convention of churches” is permitted to establish a church plan. ####  ##### Some experts have speculated that the issue may eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Disputes at top put Anthem-Cigna merger in doubt","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Cigna, Mergers & Acquisitions, E&O"," ##### Bickering between Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. executives signals that the health insurers' planned merger is looking less likely. ####  ##### Private letters between the insurers' executives obtained by the Wall Street Journal show several disagreements in their pending $54 billion merger. ####  ##### “The lack of progress and the issues that we see come to surface do put less of a probability in place as far as getting the deal done,” Vishnu Lekraj, senior equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said Tuesday. ####  ##### The discord “obviously makes it more difficult,” said Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc. “When you combine two cultures, you need a lot of cooperation.” ####  ##### According to the Journal report, leaders of both insurers have been bickering about missing deadlines to submit data to antitrust regulators, violating their merger agreement, and falling behind the merger of rivals Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. in the regulatory approval process. ####  ##### Cigna is wary of Anthem's March lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., which Cigna Chairman Isaiah Harris Jr. said in an April 9 letter could hurt the merger's chances of winning regulatory approval, the newspaper reported. ####  ##### Other issues ####  ##### Other signs also point to a growing disconnect between the insurers. ####  ##### Cigna earlier this month said in a regulatory filing that the merger may not close in the second half of 2016. But Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish said at the UBS Global Healthcare Conference on Tuesday that the insurer expects to hear a decision from antitrust regulators in July, Reuters reported. ####  ##### Cigna and Anthem representatives declined to comment on the letters. A Cigna spokesman also declined comment on the merger timeline, while an Anthem spokeswoman reiterated that the deal is expected to close in the second half of this year. ####  ##### “Since the deal was initially struck, there have been issues of culture clash, especially among management teams as far as who is going to run what part of the business and who is going to be in charge, and which firm is going to take over for the most part moving forward,” Mr. Lekraj said. ####  ##### Anthem proposed acquiring Cigna in June 2015, but it took several rounds before a deal was struck in late July. One sticking point was who would lead the company. Cigna found it “risky” for Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish to become chairman, president and CEO, Cigna said in a letter to Anthem's board of directors during June 2015 negotiations. ####  ##### The July agreement said Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, while Mr. Swedish would become chairman and CEO. ####  ##### The Anthem-Express Scripts dispute is another roadblock. ####  ##### “You really don't want to be tied up into large-scale, high-profile litigation when you are trying to get a major merger acquisition through the door of regulators,” Mr. Lekraj said. ####  ##### With the lawsuit, uncertain timeline and Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne S. DeVeydt's unexpected resignation earlier this month, “all of these things together paint a picture that there are troubles and concerns, and the very tough road that we expected has become tougher,” Mr. Zaharuk said. ####  ##### At this point, analysts said, the Aetna-Humana deal is more likely to obtain regulatory approval and that merger looks to be going much more smoothly. ####  ##### An Aetna spokesman said Tuesday that the insurer has obtained 15 of the necessary 20 state approvals. The U.S. Justice Department also must approve the combination. ####  ##### “It seems like they are ahead of the game,” Mr. Zaharuk said of the Aetna-Humana deal. ####  ##### Ana Gupte, New York-based managing director and senior research analyst at Leerink Partners L.L.C., said in a research note Friday that the Anthem-Cigna merger also is at risk due to “meaningful opposition from Fortune 500 employer customers.” ####  ##### Ms. Gupte reduced the odds of the Anthem-Cigna deal closing from 70% to “under 50%,” but still was positive that the Aetna-Humana deal would close. ####  ##### “If the managers' teams can put their egos aside, I believe the deal would pass the Justice Department review,” Mr. Lekraj said of the Anthem-Cigna merger. #### "
"Family of four health insurance tops $25,000 a year in costs ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### The cost of family coverage offered through employers' health plans is expected to rise only modestly this year, but that still will push the average cost past $25,000, Milliman Inc. said Tuesday. ####  ##### The total cost of coverage for a family of four under an employer-sponsored preferred provider organization plan — including premiums and employees' out-of-pocket expenses — rose 4.7% to an average of $25,886, Seattle-based Milliman said it in its annual “Milliman Medical Index” report. ####  ##### While that is the smallest percentage gain in the history of the analysis that began in 2001, the $1,155 increase is the 11th consecutive year that the annual increase has exceeded $1,100, according to the consulting and actuarial firm. ####  ##### Surpassing $25,000 a year for family coverage is “a significant and somewhat unsettling milestone,” Chris Girod, a San Diego based Milliman principal and consulting actuary, said in a statement. ####  ##### The report attributed much of this year's increase in overall health plan costs to a 9.1% jump in prescription drug costs. At an average of $4,270 per family, prescription drugs account for about 17% of the total cost of coverage. In contrast, all other health care services increased just 3.8%, Milliman said. ####  ##### Employers paid just over 57%, or $14,793, of health plan costs this year, according to the analysis. Employees paid an average of $6,717 in premium contributions and $4,316 in out-of-pocket expenses, such as for health care services that fall under their plans' deductibles. #### "
"Supreme Court kicks Verizon pension derisking back to lower court","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Regulation, Retirement Benefits, General liability"," ##### The U.S. Supreme Court Monday asked a federal appeals court to review the panel's earlier decision upholding the right of communications firm Verizon Communications Inc. to “derisk” the pension plan offered to management employees. ####  ##### Under that arrangement, New York-based Verizon in 2012 transferred about $7.5 billion in benefit obligations to Prudential Insurance Co. of America by purchasing a group annuity. The agreement covered about 41,000 management participants who retired and began receiving benefits before Jan. 1, 2010. ####  ##### Soon after that action, a group of Verizon retirees challenged that the transaction — one of the first in the pension derisking realm. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Dallas, alleged that that Verizon violated a provision in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by not disclosing in its summary plan description that it retained the right to remove participants from its pension plan by transferring benefit obligations to an insurer. ####  ##### The suit argued that ERISA regulations require a summary plan description to include a statement detailing the circumstances that could result in participants losing benefits they would reasonably expect the plan to provide. ####  ##### That suit was later dismissed by a federal judge who said the plaintiffs incorrectly interpreted that regulation as requiring that summary plan descriptions include when benefits will not be provided by a pension plan. ####  ##### In 2015, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling. ####  ##### But in a one-sentence decision, the Supreme Court vacated the appeals court ruling, saying that the court now must review its ruling in light of the high court's decision earlier this month — Spokeo Inc. v. Robins — in which the justices said an injury must be concrete for a plaintiff to sue. ####  ##### A Verizon spokesman said the company doubts the remand will impact the case. ####  ##### “We don't believe the Supreme Court's remand of the case back to the 5th Circuit on the narrow Constitutional standing issue will change the outcome of our case,” the spokesman said in an email statement. ####  ##### But a group representing Verizon pension plan participants welcomed the Supreme Court order. ####  ##### “The order by the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the lower court decision and send it back to be completely re-evaluated is a huge vindication of our argument,” Jack Cohen, chairman of the Cold Spring Harbor, New York-based Association of BellTel Retirees Inc., said in a statement. ####  ##### “The court has sent a powerful message that Verizon retirees — and, by extension, millions of others whose pensions have been de-risked — cannot simply be dismissed. When our assets were sold off without our consent we sought relief through the judicial system and today the highest court in the land said that we must continue to be heard,” Mr. Cohen added. ####  ##### Several dozen companies in recent years have taken actions similar to Verizon's by shifting pension plan liabilities to insurers through the purchase of group annuities. ####  ##### For employers, the appeal of such an approach is that they no longer are exposed to higher than expected contributions to their pension plans, if, for example, investment returns are less than expected and/or interest rates decline, boosting the value of plan liabilities. ####  ##### In addition, through derisking, employers, by reducing the size of their pension plans, also reduce premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. The so-called flat rate PBGC premium is based on the number of participants a company has in its pension plan, while plan sponsors are liable for an additional so-called variable rate premium if their plans are underfunded. #### "
"Lawmakers override Illinois governor's veto on Chicago police, fire pensions ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Regulation, Retirement Benefits, Political Risk"," ##### Chicago's police and fire pension fund contributions will be reduced in the near term after the Illinois General Assembly overrode Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto of the measure. ####  ##### The House and Senate voted Monday to override Mr. Rauner's Friday veto of the bill, which reduces Chicago's required pension payments to the $2.4 billion Chicago Policemen's Annuity & Benefit Fund and the $1 billion Chicago Firemen's Annuity & Benefit Fund over five years, starting in 2016, and extends the deadline for the fire and police pension funds to reach 90% funding to 2055 from the current 2040 deadline. The General Assembly originally passed the bill in May 2015. ####  ##### The measure is expected to reduce Chicago police and fire pension contributions by $220 million in 2016 and $843 million total over the next five years. ####  ##### “In his veto letter to legislators on May 27, Mr. Rauner wrote that the bill continues the “irresponsible practice” of deferring pension funding decisions and sticks taxpayers with higher future pension contributions. ####  ##### “By deferring responsible funding decisions until 2021 and then extending the timeline for reaching responsible funding levels from 2040 to 2055, Chicago is borrowing against its taxpayers to the tune of $18.6 billion,” Mr. Rauner wrote to legislators on May 27. “This practice has to stop. If we continue, we've learned nothing from our past mistakes.” ####  ##### Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rauner, maintained Monday that the bill is another example of politicians “kicking the can down the road” and instead, local and state governments should “focus on reforms that will grow our economy, create jobs and enable us live up to the promises we've made to police and firefighters.” ####  ##### Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel praised legislators on Monday for overriding Mr. Rauner's veto. “On Memorial Day I particularly want to thank the Democrats and Republicans in the General Assembly for putting politics aside and doing the right thing for Chicago taxpayers, and for our first responders,” Mr. Emanuel said in a statement. “We in the city agreed to step up and finally do our part to and responsibly fund these pensions. … While for the first time in history our police and fire pensions will be funded appropriately, I will not rest until and municipal and laborers' pensions are fully secured as well.” #### "

"Participants sue over church-plan status for hospital pension fund ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, General liability"," ##### Holy Cross Hospital and Sinai Health Systems, Chicago, are being sued by participants of a terminated defined benefit plan who are challenging its church-plan status. ####  ##### The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago alleges that Holy Cross Hospital transferred plan sponsorship and liabilities to an order of nuns, Sisters of Saint Casimir, the day before completing a merger with Sinai Health System in 2012. At the time, the plan had $31 million in liabilities after Holy Cross stopped making contributions in 2007, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### When SSC terminated the plan two years later, participants were informed that lump-sum benefits would be calculated using a termination discount rate of 13.5%, instead of the 4% rate applied under ERISA, causing some participants to receive less than half the original benefits promised, according to the lawsuit, which claims that Holy Cross’ conduct “was even more egregious” because the pension plan complied with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for 19 years. In 1993, it won approval from the IRS to qualify as a church plan retroactively as of March 1974. That made it exempt from ERISA funding and reporting rules, and benefit guarantees from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### The lawsuit notes that in March, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago denied a bid by Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan, Downers Grove, Illinois, to be considered a church pension plan on the grounds that it was not established by a church or association of churches. ####  ##### Plaintiffs are asking for joint and several liability for Holy Cross and Sinai Health Systems, payment of the unfunded liabilities plus interest, civil penalties per day per plaintiff, court costs and the appointment of an independent fiduciary. ####  ##### Rachel Dvorken, executive vice president and general counsel for Sinai Health System, declined to comment on the new lawsuit. ####  ##### Karen Handorf, a partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll representing the plaintiffs in Butler et al. vs. Holy Cross Hospital et al., said some former employees have been forced to find additional work and live on reduced incomes. “Holy Cross is an example of why the wrongful claim to church-plan status has serious consequences for retirees who have been denied the benefits that they earned through their years of employment,” Ms. Handorf said in an e-mail. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Will health insurers win reimbursement of public exchange losses? ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### A stream of health insurer lawsuits over the government's failure to make promised risk corridor payments under the health care reform law faces an outcome that is far from certain. ####  ##### At least five health insurers and co-operatives have sued the government for failing to make payments through the program meant to offset insurers' losses in their public exchange business. ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina sued last week in the Washington-based U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging it is owed $129 million through the risk corridor program established under the Affordable Care Act for its losses in 2014. ####  ##### Fellow Blues affiliate, Pittsburgh-based Highmark Inc. and several subsidiaries, sued in the same court in May, demanding $222.9 million for 2014 public exchange business. ####  ##### Portland, Oregon-based insurer Moda Health Plans Inc. along with failed co-ops Iowa-based CoOportunity Health and Oregon-based insurer Health Republic Insurance Co. of Oregon have filed similar suits. ####  ##### The issue began last year when the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it would pay only 12.6% of the money insurers requested for 2014 losses, with the rest paid in 2015 and 2016 if necessary. CMS has not yet announced the payments it will make for 2015 losses. The program sunsets after this year. ####  ##### Some insurers demand that CMS make those 2014 payments now, but it's unclear whether the lawsuits will succeed. ####  ##### Opposing views ####  ##### Nicholas Bagley, professor of law at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said the insurers have a strong claim. ####  ##### “It's likely that they will prevail in these lawsuits, and they will end up recovering what they are owed,” Mr. Bagley said. ####  ##### But this is an unusual situation, he said. Congress typically appropriates funds to cover obligations under ACA, but refused to do so for the risk corridor program. That, he said, puts the administration, which would like to pay up, in a strange position. ####  ##### “It's not clear how the administration will approach these lawsuits,” he said. ####  ##### Cynthia Borrelli, a principal at New Jersey-based law firm Bressler, Amery & Ross P.C., said in an email that she does “not believe the constitutional arguments have credibility” because funding is “always subject to appropriation” by Congress. ####  ##### Mr. Begley said an argument could be made that the insurers should have waited to sue until the risk corridor program concludes to “find out if it's in the red,” which would be 2017 when CMS calculates 2016 loss payments. ####  ##### Insurers have lost money through public exchange plans primarily because they priced the plans too low in 2014 and 2015, experts say. For example, Highmark said in April that it lost $590 million on its public exchange business in 2015. ####  ##### But while some insurers had factored future risk corridor payments into their exchange plan pricing, that's not a major reason some have lost so much on the exchanges, sources said. They priced poorly with the limited data they had available, source said. ####  ##### Plus some large health insurers were skeptical of the risk corridor program early on, said Chris Sloan, Washington-based senior manager at consultant Avalere Health. Still, co-ops relied heavily on the payments as they had no other lines of business to help offset losses, he said. ####  ##### If the lawsuits fail and insurers don't receive the risk corridor payments they are owed, it could affect their bottom line and “make it harder for them to continue to participate” in the exchange market, Mr. Bagley said. ####  ##### Despite the insurer lawsuits, I don't think these risk corridor payments will affect insurer participation going forward,” said Larry Levitt, Menlo Park, California-based senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ####  ##### Suing for the risk corridor payments is “more about trying to rebuild their surpluses,” Mr. Levitt said. ####  ##### Some said they expect more insurers to sue over the payments. ####  ##### “There's money on the table, Mr. Bagley said. “Why wouldn't you file suit?” #### "
"Health insurance mega-deals aren't winning over large employers ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Federal and state insurance regulators are determining the fate of the pending health insurance mergers, and many large employers won't be disappointed if officials torpedo the deals. ####  ##### Several surveys of Fortune 500 companies and other big employers reveal nervousness that the reduced competition among health insurers will mean higher health care costs for them. ####  ##### “Anytime you have a limited market and limited number of key players and they come together, that's not a great thing for a purchaser,” said Larry Boress, CEO of the Midwest Business Group on Health. His coalition surveyed employer members this past December, and 95% of respondents viewed the loss of competition as negative. ####  ##### The tone is especially problematic for Anthem's $53 billion acquisition of Cigna Corp., which recently has faced behind-the-scenes disputes. Both insurers deal a lot with large, self-insured employers — companies that decide to pay for the medical costs of their employees but outsource the provider networking, claims processing and care management functions to insurers. Many of these contracts between self-insured employers and insurance companies are called administrative services only, or ASO. ####  ##### Aetna Inc.'s $37 billion takeover of Humana Inc. has less to do with employer coverage and more to do with Medicare Advantage. ####  ##### Mr. Boress said employers are “quite concerned” the health plan mergers will lead to higher ASO contract fees and worse customer service. Often times, employers will want their own benefits service center for their workers, but merged plans could easily close those sites to avoid duplication and cut costs. ####  ##### Employers that participate in the Pacific Business Group on Health found problems with the rationale that health plans will pass along savings to consumers and the employers, said Bill Kramer, the organization's executive director of national health policy who has had several discussions with top member executives. ####  ##### “I think larger employers are skeptical that will occur,” Mr. Kramer said. “We haven't seen any evidence that will be the case.” ####  ##### Two investment banks, Leerink Partners and J.P. Morgan Securities, also surveyed several high-ranking health benefits executives at self-insured employers and asked them specifically about the Anthem-Cigna deal. J.P. Morgan analyst Gary Taylor summed up the overarching theme: “The survey findings were less positive than we expected.” ####  ##### Thirty percent of J.P. Morgan employer respondents did not believe a combined Anthem-Cigna, Aetna, UnitedHealth Group and state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans offered sufficient competition for the self-insured business. That 30% also believed Anthem and Cigna “would be able to raise ASO fees in an anti-competitive fashion.” J.P. Morgan surveyed 24 benefits executives at large, self-insured companies. ####  ##### “Large employers' views on this question will be a very important source of information for the DOJ, and antitrust attorneys assure us that DOJ is contacting large corporate customers to ask this question,” Mr. Taylor wrote in a synopsis of the survey. ####  ##### Both banks downgraded their admittedly arbitrary probabilities of the U.S. Justice Department approving the Anthem-Cigna deal following the employer reaction. Leerink believes the transaction has a less than 50% chance of surviving, while J.P. Morgan is somewhat more optimistic at 60%. Anthem executives have reiterated confidence the deal will get approval this year. ####  ##### However, employers are also sounding the alarms on other health care pressures, said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health. He believes the traditional structure of paying for every service, treatment or drug without any tie to quality is the main element that needs reform. ####  ##### “The bigger problem is the delivery of services and the way we pay for it,” he said. Mr. Wojcik also noted employers in the National Business Group on Health believe “the rapid consolidation among health systems” is just as troublesome. ####  ##### Anthem and Cigna are both members of the National Business Group on Health. ####  ##### Anthem and Cigna are not members of the Midwest Business Group on Health, but Aetna and Humana are. None of the merging health insurers is part of the Pacific Business Group on Health. ####  ##### Experts testifying to Congress last year used the “sumo wrestler theory” to illustrate why allowing large insurers to grow in size to compete with expanding local and national health systems won't necessarily lead to better prices and lower premiums for employers and consumers. ####  ##### “Experience suggests that a showdown between the sumo wrestlers may well result in a handshake rather than an honest wrestling match,” St. Louis University law professor Thomas Greaney testified to the House last year. ####  ##### Indeed, each business coalition expressed concern that employers are caught in the middle of health care's wide-ranging merger and acquisition frenzy. ####  ##### “The concern about consolidation is that you want to make sure the value and quality of health care doesn't erode,” Mr. Kramer said. “This will be a challenge.” ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"New health reform bill shows why Republicans struggle with replacing ACA","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Sweeping new legislation unveiled by two congressional Republicans to partly repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act highlights the formidable political and policy challenges the GOP faces in taking on a law that has significantly expanded coverage and made popular changes in insurance practices. ####  ##### The 117-page Health Empowerment Liberty Plan, or HELP, authored by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., offers libertarian-leaning proposals to help Americans buy health insurance or self-insure, guarantee they aren't discriminated against by insurers based on pre-existing medical conditions, equalize tax benefits for buying coverage, and create a more competitive health care delivery system. ####  ##### With most Republicans demanding total repeal of the ACA, what's unusual is that the bill would allow people in ACA exchange plans to keep their plans and premium subsidies or switch to a new system under which everyone is eligible to receive a $2,500-per-person refundable tax credit for buying coverage. ####  ##### “Someone who repeals (Obamacare) is left with nothing,” Rep. Sessions said at a recent news conference to discuss the bill. ####  ##### But the bill would abolish the ACA's requirements that nearly everyone must have insurance and that larger employers must offer coverage to their workers. And in a provision that's likely to prove controversial, it would limit the tax exclusion for employer health plans to $2,500 per employee, exposing companies and workers to taxes for insurance benefits above that threshold. That's interesting because Republicans in Congress have railed against the ACA's Cadillac tax on higher-value employer plans. ####  ##### “Someone who dislikes the Cadillac tax seems to be offering a proposal that functions very similar to the Cadillac tax,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a key figure in helping pass the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### But Joe Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, praised Rep. Sessions and Sen. Cassidy for addressing the health plan tax exclusion issue. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize the exclusion needs to be narrowed or eliminated to control national health care spending, he said, but everyone fears fierce blowback from large employers and labor unions, just as happened with the Cadillac tax. In December, with bipartisan support, Congress postponed the tax for two years, until 2020. ####  ##### “Sessions and Cassidy are pointing to where we ought to go,” Mr. Antos said. “What they're talking about is potentially the first step in a negotiation that might take place next year, (whether presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald) Trump or (presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary) Clinton wins the election.” ####  ##### The Sessions-Cassidy legislation comes as a House Republican task force convened by Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is set to release a health care reform proposal next month, which is expected to include full repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and restructuring of Medicare and Medicaid. ####  ##### It's not clear whether the task force members — or Mr. Trump — will consider including elements of the Sessions-Cassidy bill in their proposals. Unlike the Sessions-Cassidy bill, the House task force proposal won't be presented in legislative form, meaning that the Congressional Budget Office won't be able to score it for its budget impact or how many people would gain or lose insurance. ####  ##### A recent Modern Healthcare survey of 86 top health care industry leaders found that more than two-thirds opposed repealing and replacing the ACA. “I wish that the rhetoric about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act would just cease,” said Dr. Penny Wheeler, CEO of Allina Health System in Minneapolis. “It's wasted noise that our country doesn't need. Focusing attention on what actual aspects of the (law) need to be improved upon would be more of what I'd like people to focus on.” ####  ##### The HELP Act would offer every adult a refundable tax credit averaging $2,500, adjusted by age and geography but not based on income; every child would be eligible for a tax credit averaging $1,500. People could use the tax credit to buy coverage on their own or have their employer apply it to their health plan at work. Alternatively, they could deposit the money in a health savings account and pay directly for their medical expenses. ####  ##### People currently enrolled in ACA exchange plans could keep those plans and their premium subsidies. But those who aren't currently enrolled would only be eligible for the bill's new flat-dollar tax credits. These credits would provide less assistance to lower-income people and more to higher-income people, according to John Goodman, a libertarian health economist who helped Rep. Sessions and Sen. Cassidy develop the plan. ####  ##### Mr. Pollack said replacing the ACA's mean-tested premium subsidies with tax credits for everyone regardless of income would be a poor use of government funds. The ACA subsidy system “ensures that taxpayer help isn't wasted on people who don't need that help,” he said. “This is a major step in the wrong direction.” ####  ##### Sen. Cassidy said at a recent news conference that states could opt for a system with automatic enrollment that would cover everyone through the new tax credit rather than having people sign up for insurance. ####  ##### The bill would abolish federal minimum essential benefits, though it would allow states to regulate coverage. People could buy cheaper limited-benefit plans with an annual cap on benefits. Those who buy such plans would receive asset and wage protection if their medical bills exceeded certain thresholds. ####  ##### It also includes a number of measures to increase transparency and competition, including limits on out-of-network charges, requirements for providers and plans to disclose prices, and deregulation of physician-owned facilities, freestanding surgery centers, and retail clinics. ####  ##### While it wouldn't touch Medicare, the bill would establish a system of federal block grants to the states for each of four Medicaid populations, based on the number of beneficiaries. ####  ##### One observer found the HELP Act intriguingly unconventional but confusing. “It seems far more complicated than the ACA, which is far too complicated to begin with,” said Tim Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee University who is an expert on the reform law. “I credit them with courage for putting an actual proposal out there rather than platitudes. But if the idea is to come up with a simpler way, it's heading in exactly the wrong direction.” ####  ##### On top of that, he warned, the bill could severely disrupt the employer-based insurance system that covers most working-age Americans. Faced with sharp new limits on the deductibility of health benefits, employers could terminate their plans and tell their workers to take their new tax credits to the individual insurance market. ####  ##### “It might be the kind of offbeat thing Trump would like, but I can't imagine mainstream Republicans signing on to anything that looks like actual legislation,” Mr. Jost said. ####  ##### Mr. Antos also doubted the House Republican task force would adopt any of the more controversial elements of the Sessions-Cassidy bill. “I don't think the task force wants to cut off communications with other Republicans,” he said. “But I don't think they'll embrace it or say 'Hell no' either.” ####  ##### Harris Meyer writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"PBGC outlook brightens but not for multiemployer pensions","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Financial Results, Voluntary Benefits"," ##### The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. projects in reports issued Friday that the deficit in its single-employer insurance program eventually will disappear, but paints a very different and gloomy picture for its multiemployer insurance program, even with sweeping reform legislation Congress passed in 2014. ####  ##### In its fiscal year 2015 Projections Report, the PBGC projects that by 2025 its single-employer program, which is funded in part by premiums paid by employers with pension plans, will have a $2.6 billion surplus. ####  ##### That is a big change from last year's report, which projected a $4.9 billion deficit in 2024. ####  ##### That future surplus projection for the single-employer insurance program is in stark contrast to the program's current financial position: In 2015, the PBGC reported a $24.1 billion deficit for the insurance program, which guarantees participants' benefits up to certain limits in failed plans the agency takes over. ####  ##### In its report, the PBGC says its projection of an improving financial position for the single employer insurance program is based on several factors, including provisions in legislation Congress passed last year that boosts PBGC insurance premium rates over the next three years. The current $64 per plan participant rate will hit $80 by 2019. ####  ##### In all, the 2015 law will generate an additional $4 billion in premium income for the agency between 2016 and 2025. Last year, employers paid the PBGC about $3.8 billion in premiums. ####  ##### However, the report paints a different and dismal picture for the agency's multiemployer pension plan insurance program, even with the passage of 2014 legislation that allows financially distressed multiemployer plans to cut benefits already earned by participants. ####  ##### The PBGC projects in its report that the multiemployer insurance program deficit will hit $55.5 billion in 2025. At the end of 2025, the PBGC's multiemployer insurance plan is likely to run out of money in 57% of scenarios the agency ran, according to the report. ####  ##### The agency's multiemployer insurance fund is on a “trajectory to become insolvent within 10 years,” Secretary of Labor and PBGC Chair of the Board Thomas Perez wrote in a letter sent Friday to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. ####  ##### And the provision in the 2014 law allowing financially troubled plans to cut benefits to avoid insolvency and the shifting — up to certain limits — of plan liabilities to the PBGC, may not protect the PBGC from big losses. ####  ##### Last month, Treasury Department regulators rejected a proposal by the massively underfunded Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund to cut benefits to avoid failure. ####  ##### The Central States plan is so underfunded — it reported a $17.2 billion deficit in 2014 — that its collapse would completely drain the PBGC multiemployer insurance program, ending the “federal backstop” for benefits earned by multiemployer pension plan participants, Thomas Nyhan, the plan's executive director said earlier. ####  ##### “We must address the funding and other challenges of the multiemployer insurance program before it is too late,” Mr. Perez said. #### "
"Captive insurers' data, greater control help rein in benefits costs ","Benefits Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Management, Risk Management, Marsh & McLennan, MetLife, Bermuda"," ##### SOUTHAMPTON, Bermuda — Spotting trends and centralizing monitoring and management of global health care costs are advantages that captive insurers can bring to multinational companies that use a captive to fund employee benefits, industry experts say. ####  ##### Managing risk on a global basis is challenging.

Benefit designs vary by country, said Marc Reinhardt, Parsippany, New Jersey-based head of sales and distribution at director of the Americas at Generali Employee Benefits Network, a unit of Italy-based Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. ####  ##### “Multinational companies that are looking for ways to manage the costs of employee health benefits are shifting their focus from financial savings through driving down rates or higher benefit limits to data analytics and service management and aggregation,” Mr. Reinhardt said Tuesday during the 2016 Bermuda Captive Conference in Southampton, Bermuda. ####  ##### “Data is an important component of managing health care benefits,” said Eric Butler, New York-based vice president of global health care at MetLife Inc. “An aging population, changes in technology, drugs or surgeon tools — these medical trends are the big changes in health care costs.” ####  ##### Serving 480,000 employees in 220 countries, the employee benefits captive at Deutsche Post DHL, a mail and package delivery company, is one of the largest in the world, said Bill Fitzpatrick, its London-based vice president of global insurance and risk management. ####  ##### “Instead of having DHL individual business units buying local contracts, we consolidate those and bring them into a central network. We are seeing significant cost savings of 18% to 20% in premiums over local market product offerings,” he said of the captive that provides health insurance for each of its businesses and other coverage  including marine cargo, aviation and workers compensation. ####  ##### “The average health care costs are increasing 8% to 10% per year,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “How long can these benefits plans be sustainable? By 2020, our spending will have doubled if we do nothing. To bend that trend line, we would have to cost shift to the employees or eliminate benefits, which is why we turned to the captive program” established in  1996 with benefits added in 2011. ####  ##### Multinational employee benefits were the fastest growing risk placed in captive insurers last year, insurance brokerage Marsh L.L.C. said in a May report. #### "
"FTC loses bid to block Advocate, NorthShore merger","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### A federal judge on Tuesday handed another loss to the Federal Trade Commission, denying its request to temporarily halt a merger between Chicago-area hospital systems Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University HealthSystem. ####  ##### The proposed merger is one of the largest healthcare deals to be challenged by the FTC in years. The decision is the second loss in a row for the FTC, after years of scoring victories in such cases. ####  ##### Advocate CEO Jim Skogsbergh praised the decision in a statement. ####  ##### Judge Alonso's decision reaffirmed what we have wholeheartedly believed since day one—this merger is a big win for consumers and for healthcare in our country as the shift to value takes hold,”Skogsbergh said. ####  ##### Debbie Feinstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, in a statement Tuesday called the ruling ""disappointing"" and said the FTC will consider its options. ####  ##### The FTC alleged that a combined NorthShore and Advocate would have enough bargaining leverage with insurers to increase prices because insurers would be hard-pressed to build marketable networks without Advocate and NorthShore hospitals. The FTC said a merger would lead to an 8%, or $45 million, price increase and the systems would control 60% of general-acute inpatient hospital services in Chicago's north suburbs if they combined. ####  ##### The systems, however, said that if their market were properly defined that figure would be closer to 28%. Advocate has 12 hospitals and NorthShore has four. The systems also promised, that if allowed to unite, they'd offer a new insurance product that would cost 10% less than the lowest-priced comparable product available, saving consumers $210 million to $1.1 billion a year. ####  ##### Many have been watching the case closely as healthcare systems across the country continue to merge in what they say is an effort to improve quality and lower costs but others claim is an attempt to increase their negotiating power with insurers. ####  ##### The decision Tuesday follows another recent, relatively rare loss for the FTC. In May, a federal judge in Pennsylvania refused to grant the FTC a preliminary injunction to stop a merger between Penn State Hershey (Pa.) Medical Center and PinnacleHealth System in Harrisburg. The FTC is appealing the decision. ####  ##### In the Advocate/NorthShore case, the FTC may now appeal the matter to a higher court or continue its own administrative proceedings against the merger, though it doesn't typically continue those proceedings on its own without first getting an injunction. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Big players dropping HSA business despite growth potential","Benefits Management","Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits, Wells Fargo Insurance Services"," ##### Some big-name financial institutions recently exited the health savings account business despite the market's steady growth. A main reason: The prospects and potential profits aren't big enough compared with their other businesses. ####  ##### The latest to leave is Wells Fargo & Co., which confirmed in late May it is selling its HSA business. ####  ##### U.S. Bancorp, Huntington Bancshares Inc., M&T Bank Corp. and The Bancorp Inc., as well as insurer Assurant Inc., all sold their HSA management businesses and/or their HSA accounts within the past 12 months. JPMorgan Chase & Co. sold its HSA business in early 2015. ####  ##### As Pensions & Investments reported May 16, HSA deposit assets and the investment assets within HSAs have grown consistently — although their sizes are small compared with retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. ####  ##### Large financial institutions with many lines of business are getting out of HSAs to concentrate on bigger and more profitable businesses, said Roy Ramthun, president of HSA Consulting Services, Silver Spring, Maryland. ####  ##### “They have other priorities, and this (HSA management) is too small a piece,” Mr. Ramthun said. HSA management requires investments in technology that executives at large institutions might decide are not worth the effort given their expected return on investment. ####  ##### “The more the HSA market matures, the more consolidation you will see,” said Eric Remjeske, president of Devenir Group L.L.C., a Minneapolis-based investment adviser and consultant in the HSA business. ####  ##### Total HSA assets reached $30.2 billion in 2015, about triple the amount in 2009, said the latest annual survey by Devenir. Investments accounted for $4.2 billion, or 14% of last year's total, according to the survey based on the 100 largest HSA managers. ####  ##### Pursued by giants ####  ##### The potential for growth in HSA assets has prompted giants such as Fidelity Investments, Boston, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, New York, to continue pursuing their HSA management strategies. ####  ##### However, for the dropouts — at least those willing to comment — HSAs no longer fit their long-term strategies. ####  ##### “Wells Fargo periodically reviews its businesses and determined that the sale of (our) Health Benefit Services to an industry leader would provide our customers with a better platform for the future,” the company said in a statement. ####  ##### “Health Benefit Services has been a well-managed business for our company,” the Wells Fargo statement continued. “This decision was not an easy one to make. However, we believe that it allows us to focus on businesses that are more core to Wells Fargo's future.” ####  ##### Wells Fargo is selling its HSA business to Optum Bank Inc., part of United Health Group Inc., Minnetonka, Minnesota. A May 31 notice on the Optum website welcomed Wells Fargo HSA account holders, noting the transaction is awaiting regulatory approval. ####  ##### Representatives of Optum and Wells Fargo didn't provide transaction details, the number of HSA participants or the HSA assets that Optum was acquiring. Sources estimated Wells Fargo's HSA business covers 650,000 participants and $1.9 billion in assets. ####  ##### “By and large, the acquirers' (investment) offerings tend to be broader than those of the sellers,” said Devenir's Mr. Remjeske, referring to the recent HSA deals. ####  ##### Each of the buyers has an array of open architecture mutual fund choices for their HSA account holders. Some also offer self-directed brokerage accounts. ####  ##### According to Optum's website, HSA participants can choose among 26 mutual funds. The mutual funds are offered through Devenir. ####  ##### Optum has been an active buyer. In December 2015, it bought the HSA deposits of U.S. Bancorp, Minneapolis. Optum spokeswoman Lauren Mihajlov declined to provide any information. ####  ##### Not wanted ####  ##### Richard Davis, chairman, CEO and president of U.S. Bancorp, told securities analysts Jan. 15 that HSA management wasn't part of his long-term strategy. “We are in every business line that we're in that we want,” according to a transcript of the company's quarterly earnings call. ####  ##### “We're not in anything we don't want to be in,” Mr. Davis said. “We don't covet anything we don't have. We just want to be better at what we're doing and do it better, deeper, wherever we are.” ####  ##### Dana Ripley, a U.S. Bancorp spokesman, declined to offer additional comment. ####  ##### In June 2015, Optum acquired the HSA deposits of Huntington Bancshares. Optum's Ms. Mihajlov didn't provide any information. William Eiler, a spokesman for Huntington, declined to discuss the HSA business or the reason for selling it. ####  ##### JPMorgan sold its HSA business in January 2015 to Webster Financial Corp., Waterbury, Connecticut, whose HSA Bank unit, based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, administers the accounts. The transfer of all accounts was completed March 1, 2016, said Bob Guenther, a Webster Financial spokesman. ####  ##### Mr. Guenther said HSA Bank administers 2 million HSA accounts, with $4.08 billion in deposit assets and $728 million in investments. The JPMorgan business contributed about 700,000 accounts, $1.3 billion in deposits and $175 million in investments, he said. Kristen Chambers, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. ####  ##### The HSA Bank website said participants can choose from 19 mutual funds, offered through Devenir, and a self-directed brokerage account from TD Ameritrade. ####  ##### Another recent buyer of HSA accounts from banks is HealthEquity Inc., Draper, Utah. HealthEquity is an HSA custodian firm with 2.2 million members as of April 30, up 51% from 12 months earlier. ####  ##### The company's HSA assets under management rose to $4.1 billion by April 30, an increase of 61% from a year earlier. The AUM includes $488 million in investments, up 41%. ####  ##### HealthEquity offers 41 mutual funds, which are selected by HealthEquity Advisors L.L.C., its investment subsidiary, the company website said. ####  ##### HealthEquity also offers a group of 26 “optional choice” mutual funds for additional fees. ####  ##### “You need specialized capabilities in function and distribution” to manage HSA accounts profitably and effectively, said Jon Kessler, president and CEO of HealthEquity. Without a willingness to invest in technology and distribution, an HSA account manager might choose to exit the business, he added. ####  ##### HealthEquity bought about 35,000 HSA accounts with $63 million in assets from M&T Bank Inc., Buffalo. The deal was announced in January and closed in March, Mr. Kessler said. ####  ##### Chet Bridger, an M&T spokesman, declined to comment. ####  ##### Closed its purchase ####  ##### HealthEquity in December 2015 closed its purchase of about 160,000 HSA accounts representing about $390 million in deposits from The Bancorp Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, Mr. Kessler said. ####  ##### John Chrystal said the HSA sale “was a strategic decision that was accretive to our earnings and capital,” according to a transcript of a Feb. 1 earnings conference call with analysts. At the time of the conference call, Mr. Chrystal was interim CEO of The Bancorp; he remains a director. ####  ##### In another recent HSA deal, SelectAccount, St. Paul, Minnesota, acquired HSA assets and other medical-account assets from Assurant Inc., a New York-based insurance company. SelectAccount administers HSAs and other medical spending accounts. ####  ##### Assurant wanted “to sharpen our focus on the housing and lifestyle markets,” and the HSA deal was part of its effort to “wind down our health insurance business,' said Alan Colberg, the company's CEO and president, in a March 15 news release. ####  ##### In an interview, David Cantu, chief marketing officer of SelectAccount, said the deal closed April 1, enabling his company to acquire 10,000 HSA accounts with $59.8 million in assets. ####  ##### SelectAccount now has more than 250,000 HSA accounts with $700 million in deposit assets and $105 million in investment assets. Its HSA program offers 26 mutual funds; Devenir is the investment adviser.

"Retirees sue Weyerhaeuser over terminated health benefits ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Regulation, General liability"," ##### Forest-products manufacturer Weyerhaeuser Co. violated earlier promises to its retired employees by first cutting and then terminating health benefits for several thousand retirees, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. ####  ##### Four retired Weyerhaeuser employees charged in the suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon, that Weyerhaeuser's action in 2011 to replace its retiree medical plan with a health reimbursement arrangement in which the company contributed just over $1,300 a year to retirees' HRAs, followed by its decision in 2015 to eliminate the HRAs, clashed with earlier commitments to provide coverage. ####  ##### In 2009, for example, according to the suit, the company's top executive, wrote in correspondence outlining a new health care plan, that the company remained “committed to offering medical benefits to retirees.” ####  ##### The suit, filed by the law firm Haglund Kelley L.L.P. in Portland, seeks reinstatement of the benefits consistent with those promised in a 1979 summary plan description document. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for Federal Way, Washington-based Weyerhaeuser said the company does not comment on pending litigation. #### "

"Health insurer joins stampede to narrow networks","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is cutting back its participation in the state's Affordable Care Act insurance exchange next year after losing nearly $300 million in the individual market in 2015. ####  ##### However, the large Blues insurer is not completely exiting the state-based marketplace. Fully withdrawing has its consequences: Federal law bars insurers from re-entering the marketplaces for five years, assuming they discontinue all types of individual policies. ####  ##### Instead, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is dropping health plans with the broadest networks sold on and off the exchange and will push people toward its narrower HMO option called Blue Plus, according to the Star Tribune. ####  ##### Plans with more limited networks of doctors and hospitals usually offer cheaper monthly premiums, which has been appealing to the price-sensitive exchange crowd, but they have also created some confusion for members unfamiliar with the products. ####  ##### “The premiums will be lower, but (consumers) may not get the same choice of doctors and hospitals that they had before,” said Roger Feldman, a health economist at the University of Minnesota. “It's one of the hard choices that's being increasingly faced in health insurance more generally.” ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota's decision is not unprecedented and has been embraced by other insurers around the country. The Blues plans in Illinois, New Mexico and Texas — all of which are owned by Health Care Service Corp., a giant Chicago-based company that has lost billions of dollars on ACA plans — abandoned their broad-network exchange plans in favor of the narrow-network HMOs. ####  ##### “Some of these Blue plans are not able to tolerate these significant losses,” said Cynthia Cox, an associate director and health insurance researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ####  ##### Ms. Cox also said Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota's emphasis on its HMO subsidiary is similar to what UnitedHealth Group Inc. has done in some exchange states. Although UnitedHealthcare Inc. is only staying in a handful of ACA marketplaces, its Harken Health subsidiary is ramping up in Florida, Georgia and Illinois. Harken is a clinic-based health plan built on the premise of providing primary care at no charge. ####  ##### Dropping broad-network plans can also be seen as a controversial risk dump for insurers. The sickest people who cost the most to insure often chose plans with higher monthly premiums to gain access to broader provider networks and fewer out-of-pocket costs. In Minnesota next year, those people may opt to buy those plans with other carriers, immediately benefiting the Blues' bottom line while redirecting the insurance risk elsewhere. ####  ##### Mr. Feldman said what Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and other insurers are doing reminds him of when HMOs became the default health policy a couple decades ago, and when individuals and employees revolted at the restricted choice of providers. ####  ##### “Almost everything has been tried at least once,” Mr. Feldman said. “This does represent a return to the model we had in the 1990s, and we went away from it because people were not willing to make the trade-off at that point.” He sees the employer market eventually making its way down this path as well, considering the ACA's “Cadillac” tax on high-cost health plans goes into effect in 2020. ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota ended 2015 with a $178 million net loss on $3.76 billion of revenue from its fully insured lines of business, according to financial documents. Those totals don't include business from self-insured employers. The company's underwriting losses just on individual-market plans — which don't include administrative expenses or taxes — totaled $280 million. ####  ##### However, its Blue Choice subsidiary posted a $52 million net surplus on $895 million of revenue in 2015, according to separate financial filings. ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota did not respond to interview requests. ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Will Trump embrace controversial House GOP health proposals?","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### After promising for six years to offer a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, House Republican leaders last week presented a white paper that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called “a real plan, in black and white” to “make health care actually affordable.” ####  ##### But several health policy experts questioned that description, given that the 35-page document contains few details and no numbers describing how much the proposal would cost, how it would be financed or how many Americans would gain or lose health insurance. ####  ##### Past presidential candidates including President Barack Obama have laid out similarly vague campaign blueprints. Now, however, Rep. Ryan and his colleagues want to replace a law that has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans and helped slow spending growth. ####  ##### “The difference between putting down principles and writing legislation is that when you write legislation, you have to commit to numbers and details,” said John Goodman, a veteran GOP health policy adviser who helped draft a recent ACA replacement bill sponsored by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. He nevertheless praised parts of the House GOP package. ####  ##### Several experts called the House GOP manifesto a rehash of old conservative ideas that Republicans have never seriously tried to implement. “It's no more a plan than saying, 'I'm going to build a house. Here's a stick-figure picture of it, and I can get it for you for next to nothing,'” said Norm Ornstein, a veteran political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. ####  ##### There was skepticism about whether presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would embrace it, particularly its politically volatile calls to cap Medicaid spending and turn Medicare into a defined-contribution program, exposing future retirees to higher out-of-pocket costs. During the primaries, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Rep. Ryan's past efforts to restructure and cut those programs, and blamed his proposals for Mitt Romney's loss in the 2012 presidential election. Some think Mr. Trump is likely to repudiate the Medicare part of the GOP plan, though other parts overlap with his own brief seven-point proposal. ####  ##### “Ryan's Medicare voucher plan has been shown to be extremely unpopular in polls among people age 50 and older,” said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. ####  ##### The plan, which lacks details and numbers, would make big changes in Medicare and Medicaid. ####  ##### After repealing the ACA and its coverage mandates, the House GOP plan would offer people who lack public or employer coverage a refundable tax credit in an unspecified amount — adjusted by age, not income — to help them buy insurance. It would limit the tax exclusion for employer health plans; convert Medicaid into a program of capped federal contributions to the states, rolling back the coverage expansion to low-income, able-bodied adults; change Medicare into a “premium support” model while gradually raising the eligibility age to 67; and implement a wide array of standard conservative proposals, such as interstate sales of health plans, expansion of health savings accounts and limits on medical malpractice suits. ####  ##### It seeks to make the individual market more financially viable for insurers by allowing them to charge older and sicker customers at least five times more than younger and healthier members, rather than the ACA's maximum of three times more. ####  ##### Mr. Goodman said Rep. Ryan's group dodged the tough trade-offs. By repealing the ACA's hundreds of billions in taxes, GOP lawmakers would be left with little revenue for funding adequate tax credits to make coverage affordable to those without employer-based plans. “The brutal reality that Republicans have been reluctant to discuss is if you repeal all of Obamacare, there is no money to insure all of the uninsured,” he said. ####  ##### That may be all right with Rep. Ryan, because universal health care is not necessarily his goal. “Obamacare is all about quantity, with the goal to get as many people insured as possible,” he said at the plan's rollout Wednesday. “Our plan is about quality. We'll give (consumers) the tools to get the best care possible. We give you a choice and put you in charge, not the bureaucracy.” ####  ##### But repealing the ACA taxes would force Republicans to rely on imposing a tax on employer health plans that's more onerous than the ACA's so-called Cadillac plan tax, which Congress postponed with bipartisan support in December. ####  ##### While the GOP white paper says that “most Americans' plans would not be affected,” Mr. Goodman thinks otherwise. “If that tax isn't big, they won't have the money to have a reasonable tax credit,” he said. “And if it's big, it will hit the average worker.” ####  ##### That could cause political headaches for Republicans in the November elections, and afterward, if they win and try to cap the tax exclusion for employer health plans. Business groups including the National Business Group on Health have already come out against the GOP plan to tax employer health plans. ####  ##### Another potential political problem for Republicans is their plan would roll back the ACA's popular guarantee that consumers can obtain insurance during an annual open enrollment despite pre-existing medical conditions. ####  ##### Under the GOP plan, individuals would have a one-time opportunity to enroll without regard to pre-existing conditions, and would be able to keep that coverage as long as they stayed continuously enrolled. But if they discontinued coverage for any reason, insurers could base their premiums on health status. Alternatively, people could receive coverage in state high-risk pools, which the Republican plan would fund with at least $25 billion over 10 years. Experts say that probably wouldn't be enough to provide decent, affordable coverage to the sickest Americans. ####  ##### “What happens to a working-poor person who loses a job and has to go off insurance for a month or two?” Mr. Ornstein asked. “You are putting them back into the situation where for the rest of their lives insurers can deny them coverage.” ####  ##### Harris Meyer writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Court rules UnitedHealthcare can be sued for millions in unpaid bills ","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, UnitedHealth Group, General liability, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### A federal court has ruled that an out-of-network Texas hospital system can sue UnitedHealthcare Inc. for $104 million in unpaid hospital bills. ####  ##### In an opinion filed Tuesday, the U.S. District Court in Dallas said Texas General Hospital can bring multiple claims under federal and state law to recover reimbursements that UnitedHealthcare failed to make over a three-year period. ####  ##### Texas General Hospital, based in Grand Prairie, Texas, provided health care services to nearly 2,000 UnitedHealthcare plan members between February 2012 and June 2015, for which the hospital billed the insurer $139.2 million, according to Texas General Hospital L.P. and Texas General GP L.L.C. v. UnitedHealthcare Services Inc. and UnitedHelathcare Insurance Co. ####  ##### Texas General is not included in UnitedHeathcare's provider network, so patients were required to assign their benefits to Texas General prior to getting treated. The hospital also received coverage verification and pre-certification from UnitedHealthcare before services were rendered. ####  ##### But UnitedHealthcare never fully paid up. The health insurer to date has only reimbursed Texas General for $30.1 million of the total amount billed, according to court documents. ####  ##### With patient co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles factored in, Texas General was paid only $35.1 million total for its services, according to the documents. ####  ##### Texas General filed its original suit on June 19, 2015, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, alleging that UnitedHealthcare led the hospital to believe the provided health care services would be covered, then wrongfully denied or reduced coverage and significantly underpaid the hospital. ####  ##### The insurer filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the District Court's chief judge, Barbara M. G. Lynn, said Texas General has made several “plausible” claims to recover benefits. ####  ##### While UnitedHealthcare argued the hospital did not exhaust all administrative remedies, the court said the insurer failed to “provide meaningful access to administrative remedies” and further efforts by the hospital would be futile. ####  ##### The court also found that Texas General can sue for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and promissory estoppel. ####  ##### However, it dismissed the claim that UnitedHealthcare breached fiduciary duty under ERISA, finding that the benefits assignment Texas General received from UnitedHealthcare plan members did not give the hospital standing to sue. #### "

"Cost-conscious employers revisit HMOs","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Health insurers and employers are limiting plan members' choice of doctors and hospitals in a revamp of the once-popular health maintenance organization model that focused on runaway health costs. ####  ##### Now, however, provider networks are being tightened to include only those lower-cost doctors and other providers who also produce better outcomes and improve patient satisfaction. ####  ##### In late June, citing high costs and massive projected losses, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota said it will offer only a narrow-network HMO to state residents who don't have employer-sponsored coverage. More than 100,000 people will have to find new coverage for 2017, according to the insurer. ####  ##### BCBS has company in shifting to narrower networks, which limit the doctors patients can see and hospitals they can use without paying higher out-of-network charges. On public insurance exchanges established under the health care reform law, about half of plans had a narrow network in 2015, and median premiums for narrow networks were as much as 23% less than those for broad-network plans, according to a McKinsey & Co. study. ####  ##### Employers are showing greater interest as well. In 2015, 26% of large employers offered “high-performance networks” — or narrow networks based on quality and cost — in some or all of their plans, according to the Washington-based National Business Group on Health. ####  ##### “We think that there's going to be a strong future,” for high-performance networks, said Steve Wojcik, NBGH vice president of public policy. ####  ##### The tactic, which sources say limits wasteful use of health care services, is not without its controversy. ####  ##### Narrow networks, made popular by HMOs that became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, resulted in consumer rebellion against the limited choices of doctors and hospitals. Some critics say the approach often requires patients to travel farther to get care, and others argue many narrow networks lack enough specialists. ####  ##### “Consumer choice was extraordinarily high on the consumer preference list” a few decades ago, said Dr. A. Mark Fendrick, director of the Center for Value-based Insurance Design at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a professor of internal medicine and health management and policy. ####  ##### But as health costs have risen and individuals' share of the costs increased, there's been “a shift in terms of consumers willing to give up ultimate unlimited choice to be able to save some out-of-pocket expenses,” he said. ####  ##### For example, out-of-pocket spending for hospitalizations of patients with private health coverage rose 37.3% from 2009 to 2013, when it reached $1,013 on average, according to a study published in June by JAMA Internal Medicine and conducted by researchers with the University of Michigan. ####  ##### “This is a much more blunt instrument to try to control demand by the employees,” versus high-deductible health plans, which attempt “to get employees to use less of all care,” he said. ####  ##### “A narrow network to us from a design standpoint is if we could have certain hospitals that we steer our employees to that says this is a good hospital for this type of procedure, we know your procedure is going to be even better … so we will incent you to go to those good hospitals,” said Carol Partington, employee benefits and compensation manager at Oak Brook, Illinois-based Elkay Manufacturing Co., a maker of stainless steel sinks. ####  ##### Elkay introduced a narrow network for specialty surgeries, such as heart or knee surgery, in January. For employees who use one of the in-network hospitals, determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield based on outcomes data, Elkay will pay 90% of the employee's cost after the deductible, rather than the usual 80%. ####  ##### Elkay, however, does not have a narrow network for primary care visits. ####  ##### “It made more sense for the specialty surgeries because those are where your costs are,” Ms. Partington said. ####  ##### But few other employers use narrow networks because “there are not a ton of high-performing networks out there that have demonstrated over time that they are effective,” said Dan Graovac, Boston-based principal of health exchange solutions with Xerox HR Services. ####  ##### For a large employer with employees across the country, the narrow network strategy is more difficult to pull off. ####  ##### “They need coverage across many states, and so oftentimes these broad networks are still the general preference of the employers that we work with,” said Trevis Parson, Philadelphia-based chief actuary of health and group benefits at Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. ####  ##### Even so, experts expect high-performance networks to grow in popularity, especially as employers remain cost-conscious. ####  ##### “There's a cost gap that employers are still continuing to have to solve, and they are not just looking at the dollar side of the cost equation anymore; they are also looking at the use side of the cost equation,” Mr. Parson said. “Where do we avoid unnecessary readmissions? How do we manage our message to employees and our contracts with providers in a way that puts programs in place that push away unnecessary use of services and drive better outcomes?” ####  ##### And as HDHPs have become more widespread — 83% of large employers said they would offer an HDHP in 2016, according to the 2015 NBGH study — it's likely narrow networks also will become more common, said Sandra Morris, former senior manager of U.S. benefits design at Procter & Gamble Co. and now the owner of consulting firm About Quality Benefits Design L.L.C. in Cincinnati. #### "
"Employers look to public exchanges for pre-Medicare retiree benefits ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers, Willis Towers Watson"," ##### Amid continuing cost increases, a sizeable majority of employers offering health care coverage to pre-Medicare-eligible retirees expect to change those plans, according to a survey released Tuesday. ####  ##### The Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. survey of 467 employers found that 72% of employers plan to make moderate to significant changes in their pre-65 retiree health programs over the next four years. ####  ##### Just over half — 56% — of surveyed employers are optimistic that the public health insurance exchanges authorized by the 2010 health care reform law and which began operating in 2014 will be an alternative to coverage they now offer their pre-Medicare-eligible retirees by 2018. ####  ##### An advantage to that approach: Lower-income pre-Medicare eligible retirees — those with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level — are eligible for federal premium subsidies for plans purchased in the public exchanges. For example, subsidies are available in 2016 for a family of four collectively earning up to $97,000. ####  ##### The public exchanges are not available to Medicare-eligible retirees. ####  ##### With Medicare not available to younger retirees, “Employers are looking elsewhere for a solution,” John Barkett, Willis Towers Watson’s senior director of policy affairs in Washington, said in a statement. ####  ##### That employer interest in moving pre-Medicare eligible retirees to public exchanges is being fueled by health plan cost increases. For example, employers offering coverage to pre-age 65 retirees expect that without plan changes, cost increases will average 5.7% in 2016, according to the Willis Towers Watson survey. Employers making plan changes expect costs to increase an average of 4.1%. ####  ##### Those expected cost increases are substantially higher than for those offering coverage to older retirees — those at least age 65 — who are eligible to receive the bulk of their coverage through the federal Medicare program. Employers making plan changes for those retirees expect costs in 2016 to increase an average of 2.7%, or 3.3% for those not making changes. ####  ##### The Willis Towers Watson 2016 Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey was taken in January and February of this year. #### "
"Proposal adds twist to health plan opt out rules","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### Proposed IRS regulations that could penalize employers offering financial incentives to certain employees to opt out of company-provided health insurance plans also would shield employers from a health reform law affordability penalty in some cases. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, employers face a $3,240 penalty for each employee whose single-coverage premium exceeds 9.66% of household income — if the employee enrolls in a public exchange health plan and receives a federal premium subsidy. ####  ##### While few employers require employees to pay premiums that would trigger the ACA affordability penalty, rules the IRS proposed earlier this month and effective in 2017 would significantly increase the likelihood of triggering the affordability penalty. ####  ##### Under the rules, employers running the affordability test would have to count the payments they offer to employees who opt out of their health plans, as well as premiums employees are required to make to receive employer coverage. ####  ##### In explaining how the health plan affordability test is to be run, the IRS said the opt-out offer is comparable to pretax contributions employees use to pay their share of the premium for employer-provided health insurance. ####  ##### “In both cases, the employee may purchase the employer-sponsored coverage only at the price of forgoing a specified amount of cash compensation that the employee would otherwise receive — salary, in the case of a salary reduction, or an equal amount of other compensation, in the case of an opt-out payment,” the IRS said. ####  ##### “The economic cost to the employee of the employer-sponsored coverage is the same under both arrangements. Accordingly, the employee's required contribution generally should be determined similarly regardless of the type of payment that an employee must forgo,” the IRS said. ####  ##### Take the case of an employer that requires its employees to pay $100 a month for coverage and gives $200 a month to employees that opt out of company coverage. In that example the employee's cost of coverage, under the IRS rules, would be $300 a month or $3,600 a year, an amount that could, depending on employee income, significantly increase the likelihood of triggering the ACA affordability penalty. ####  ##### “That certainly would have an impact on employers with opt-out arrangements,” said Leslie Anderson, a Mercer L.L.C. partner in Minneapolis. ####  ##### But the IRS also said there's a simple way for employers to avoid the affordability penalty: have employees attest that they and their dependents have coverage through another group health plan, which typically would be through the employee's spouse. ####  ##### “It is a relatively easy fix. Employees would just have to attest that they and dependents have group coverage and then the opt-out payments are excluded in running the affordability test,” said Rich Stover, a principal at Xerox HR Services in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### The IRS' proposed rules “will not adversely affect employers' affordability test as long as employers do some upfront work,” said Molly Iacovoni, an Aon Hewitt partner in Lincolnshire, Illinois. ####  ##### Still, with a 2017 effective date, employers will have to move quickly to obtain the required health plan coverage attestation forms from employees, said Ed Fensholt, senior vice president and director of compliance services at Lockton Cos. L.L.C.'s benefit group in Kansas City, Missouri. ####  ##### A small but still substantial number of employers offer opt-out arrangements. For example, a 2015 Mercer survey found that 13% of employers with at least 500 employees offered opt-out arrangements with an average payment of $1,879 per year. ####  ##### Such arrangements are a “win-win for all,” said Lockton's Mr. Fensholt, since employers reduce their health plan costs by having fewer participants and employees who are typically getting coverage through a spouse's employer plan are also getting a cash payment. ####  ##### Based on health care reform law formulas, benefit consultants project the employer penalty for not offering affordable coverage will rise to $3,390 in 2017, while the premium affordability income trigger will rise to 9.69% of family income. #### "
"Justice Department nearing decision on health insurer mergers ","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### Roughly a year since four major U.S. health insurers struck deals to merge, federal antitrust regulators are close to issuing a decision. ####  ##### Proposed deals to combine Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc., as well as Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. are nearing the tipping point: Aetna this week secured its 18th of 20 approvals needed to take over rival Humana, an Aetna spokesman said. ####  ##### New York state insurance regulators gave conditional approval of the merger, Bloomberg reported Monday. A spokesman for the New York Department of Financial Services declined to confirm the approval. ####  ##### Next up, Georgia is scheduled to hold a public hearing July 26 on the proposed $37 billion Anthem-Cigna deal. The $54.2 billion Anthem-Cigna deal is farther behind with 12 of 26 necessary state approvals. ####  ##### However, the U.S. Justice Department is expected to make a decision in both deals as soon as mid-July. ####  ##### Aetna on Friday reportedly met with Justice Department officials to make its case, just two weeks after a similar meeting between regulators and Anthem and Cigna executives, according to Bloomberg. ####  ##### Aetna-Humana more likely ####  ##### Generally, analysts agree that the Aetna-Humana deal is more likely to win approval than the Anthem-Cigna merger, but most observers caution that the deals are unprecedented and make predictions difficult to make. ####  ##### “I don't see it happening,” said Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc., referring to the Anthem-Cigna deal. As for Aetna's merger with Humana, “I'm more confident.” ####  ##### “We still see this deal getting done,” Thomas A. Carroll, analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., said of the Aetna-Humana deal in a research note last week. ####  ##### Analyst Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners L.L.C. estimates that the Aetna-Humana deal has an 80% chance of closing, while the Anthem-Cigna merger has a less than 50% chance, according to recent research notes. ####  ##### The Justice Department's review focuses on the impact of the proposed mergers on competition, and whether certain divestitures could maintain competition, antitrust experts say. ####  ##### Concerns about the Aetna and Humana merger largely revolve around its impact on competition in the Medicare Advantage market. Aetna and Humana combined would cover about 4.5 million out of a total 17.6 million individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans — nearly a quarter of the market. But the combined organization would cover only 8% of the entire Medicare market, including traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage, according to the Center for American Progress. ####  ##### Aetna's position has been that Medicare Advantage and Medicare compete, thus lessening post-merger competition concerns. Historically, however, the Justice Department has considered them to be two distinct markets that don't compete, said Thomas Greaney, an antitrust expert formerly with the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now co-director of the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University School of Law. ####  ##### Anthem and Cigna deal mainly with the employer market and cater to many self-insured employers who contract only for administrative services. Analysts say there are few administrative services providers to absorb divestitures. ####  ##### If the Justice Department were to sue and a judge block the mergers, Anthem would owe Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee, and Aetna would owe Humana $1 billion, according to their merger agreements. ####  ##### Both Anthem and Aetna should be able to stomach those losses, as they've been building cash this year to subsidize the mergers, said James Sung, associate director and insurance credit analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. ####  ##### Even without Humana, Aetna will remain stable, Mr. Zaharuk said. ####  ##### “It was a nice strategic move to buy Humana, (but) I don't think it's necessary for Aetna in its overall strategic plans,” he said. ####  ##### On the other hand, Anthem was looking to become “more of a national company” beyond the 14 states where it sells insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield name, he said. Without the Cigna deal, Anthem will have to go “back to the drawing board, and they are going to have to reset their strategy.” #### "
"Health insurer mergers in jeopardy after suit cites competitive concerns","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### The U.S. Justice Department's strong objections to merging Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc. with Humana Inc., outlined in federal litigation filed last month, have left significant doubt about either deal being completed. ####  ##### Many analysts hold that the $37 billion Aetna-Humana tie-up has a stronger chance of winning approval than the $54 billion Anthem-Cigna union. ####  ##### “We believe that a settlement including divestitures is still probable, and in fact, we think that Aetna has a relatively strong case should this eventually make it to court,” Barclays P.L.C. analysts said in a research report. ####  ##### However, Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc., said “the deck seems to be stacked against” the Anthem-Cigna combination. ####  ##### “We see the likelihood of any settlement or win for the companies in court as slim given the political nature of the outcome and the tone of the communication” from the Justice Department, Leerink Partners L.L.C. Managing Director and Analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note after the Justice Department litigation. ####  ##### In lawsuits filed July 21 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department objected to the potential deals on anticompetitive grounds and suggested that there were no circumstances in which it would change its mind. ####  ##### If allowed, the mergers that are “unprecedented in their scope and in their scale” would likely “threaten to increase insurance premiums, to reduce benefits, to lower the quality of health care and to slow innovation,” Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General William Baer said during a news conference about the litigation. ####  ##### Aetna, Humana and Anthem quickly responded to the Justice Department's decision with vows to fight (see related story), each arguing that the mergers would benefit consumers and not harm competition. ####  ##### Cigna, on the other hand, seemed less enthusiastic in its initial response, stating that it would evaluate its options and that it expected the transaction to close in 2017, “if at all.” ####  ##### On Friday, however, Cigna President and CEO David Cordani attempted to dispel concerns about the insurer's commitment, saying it is “fully engaged” in the merger process with Anthem. He also said that in case the merger is blocked, Cigna will have significant capital to seek growth opportunities elsewhere. ####  ##### As of late last Friday, Anthem was the only insurer to file a response to the Justice Department's litigation. Anthem also has asked for a speedy antitrust trial, though government attorneys late last week urged the court not to rush the complex case. Aetna and Humana also motioned for an expedited trial due to merger agreement deadlines, according to court documents. ####  ##### Competition objections ####  ##### The Justice Department's objections to the Aetna-Humana combination center largely on reduced competition in the Medicare Advantage market that would result from the merger. Humana, the second-largest Medicare Advantage provider by covered members, competes with Aetna, the fourth-largest, in nearly 90% of the counties where Aetna offers Medicare Advantage. ####  ##### The Justice Department holds that Medicare Advantage does not compete with traditional Medicare. Aetna and Humana disagree. ####  ##### Barclays analysts said in a research note after the Justice Department suit that the federal agency did not make a compelling argument why the two markets don't compete, adding that both cater to seniors and offer the same base benefits. ####  ##### However, the fact that seniors have the choice between the two products “doesn't mean they are substitutes,” said Thomas Greaney, an antitrust expert formerly with the Justice Department's antitrust division who now is co-director of the Center for Health Law Studies at St. Louis University School of Law. ####  ##### Medicare Advantage has distinct characteristics, such as greater benefits, lower premiums and a cap on annual out-of-pocket costs, according to the Justice Department's lawsuit. ####  ##### At the heart of the Justice Department's objections to the Anthem-Cigna union is reduced competition for health insurance and administrative services in the national and local employer markets. ####  ##### The Justice Department also argues that eliminating Cigna as a competitor to Anthem would reduce innovation in moving toward value-based care in the health insurance industry — a major movement today to reduce health care costs. ####  ##### “That's been a factor in some antitrust merger cases, the fact that one company that's merging ... is a maverick,” Mr. Greaney said. In that case, “you're losing the one that puts price and innovation pressure on the others.” ####  ##### The Justice Department also argued that the mergers would harm competition that holds down prices on public health insurance exchanges, and Mr. Baer said divestitures proposed until that point were “incomplete and impractical” and unlikely to solve any antitrust concerns. ####  ##### Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini countered during a CNBC interview July 21 that Aetna has provided “two separate bidders with complete bids, signable contracts that would buy the whole business from us” in each of the problem markets the Justice Department pinpointed. ####  ##### Even so, sources said post-merger divestitures often fail to restore competition. ####  ##### Decided in the courts ####  ##### Ultimately, it's not the Justice Department's call whether the five largest national health insurers become three, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. being the largest and not involved in the mergers, said Andrea Murino, a Washington-based partner and co-chair of the antitrust group at Goodwin Procter L.L.P. ####  ##### It's unclear how U.S. District Court Judge John D. Bates, who has been assigned to the cases, will rule. ####  ##### However, federal antitrust enforcers have “been on a hot streak” of winning antitrust cases lately, Ms. Murino said. ####  ##### In the past two years, several large companies have abandoned merger plans after the Justice Department filed suit. They include Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Inc., General Electric Co. and AB Electrolux, and National CineMedia Inc. and Screenvision L.L.C. ####  ##### Still, federal courts ruled against the Federal Trade Commission twice this year in cases brought against hospital mergers in Chicago and Pennsylvania. The FTC has appealed both. ####  ##### There's also political tension in merger cases, Ms. Murino said. Antitrust law appears to be at odds with the Affordable Care Act, which seems to encourage consolidation and collaboration in the health care sector, she said. ####  ##### “The DOJ will tell you that — and the FTC would say this, too — that there's no tension between the ACA and the antitrust laws, but I bet if you asked (the health insurers') lawyers, they would say there very much is,” Ms. Murino said. ####  ##### Litigation could take months, and the losing party could appeal the decision, Mr. Greaney said. ####  ##### Observers say the outcome of the litigation may not be known until next year. ####  ##### If the deals are blocked, Anthem would owe Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee and Aetna would owe Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, according to their merger agreements. ####  ##### Anthem and Aetna have the cash to pay those fees, sources say, and the fees would give Cigna and Humana opportunities to expand, Mr. Zaharuk said. ####  ##### The insurers could turn their sights to “less transformational” deals with smaller health insurers, as they've done in the past, said Mark Rouck, Chicago-based senior director with Fitch Ratings Inc. #### "

However, more than 250 plans offered the Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, and at least 70 plans offered State Street's CIT. ####  ##### New York Life spokesman Kevin Maher said the firm is reviewing the case and doesn't have a comment on it at this time. ####  ##### Asset managers and record-keeping firms increasingly are being targeted by employees over their own retirement plans. Earlier in July, American Century Cos Inc., the parent of American Century Investments, was sued for self-dealing related to proprietary fund offerings in its 401(k) plan. ####  ##### That followed similar suits filed last year against Allianz Global Investors, Pacific Investment Management Co. and their parent company, Allianz Asset Management, as well as another against Putnam Investments. ####  ##### Other asset managers such Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. and MFS Investment Management, which have 401(k) plans loaded with proprietary funds, are ripe targets for litigation, lawyers say. ####  ##### More broadly, 401(k) lawsuits alleging fiduciary breach for excessive fees have proliferated in the last decade or so, as such legal matters have generally met success and paid out big settlements to plaintiffs and their attorneys. ####  ##### Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Transamerica settled allegations involving their retirement plans this year, for $31 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Ameriprise Financial and Fidelity Investments also paid out multimillion-dollar settlements over the past two years. ####  ##### The New York Life suit was filed by the law firm Nichols Kaster, which is very familiar with these types of self-dealing cases — it is representing plaintiffs in the cases against American Century, Allianz and Putnam. ####  ##### em>Greg Iacurci writes for InvestmentNews, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Express Scripts releases list of costly drugs it won't cover for 2017","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### (Reuters) — Express Scripts Holding Co. said on Monday it would add a handful of medicines in 2017 to its list of drugs that are excluded from insurance coverage, including treatments for arthritis and psoriasis, while several other medicines will be removed from the exclusion list. ####  ##### The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager has been excluding medicines from its coverage list since 2014, citing concern about costs to its health insurers and corporate customers. The 2017 excluded medicines list will entail 85 drugs, it said, compared with 87 in 2016. ####  ##### By excluding drugs from its formulary, Express Scripts said it has been better able to negotiate lower prices from drugmakers, and will thereby save customers an estimated $1.8 billion in 2017, up from $1.3 billion this year. The coverage list determines whether millions of people with private insurance can easily use an insurance co-pay to buy their medicine. ####  ##### The drugs that will be newly excluded in 2017 include Zyclara, a skin cream for actinic keratosis sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., a Canadian drugmaker that has been criticized for big price increases on its products. The condition involves scaly skin growths that can develop into skin cancer. ####  ##### An Express Scripts spokesman declined to comment whether Zyclara, which costs more than $1,100 a tube, or other specific drugs, have been excluded because of price hikes. ####  ##### Other drugs that will be newly excluded from coverage next year include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s arthritis treatment Orencia, Eli Lilly and Co.'s new Taltz treatment for psoriasis and brands of gout drug colchicine sold by privately held Prasco Laboratories and West Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp., a unit of Hikma. ####  ##### Express Scripts said a number of drugs excluded in 2016 will no longer be excluded next year, including Pfizer Inc.'s arthritis drugs Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR and GlaxoSmithKline P.L.C.'s Arnuity Ellipta and Flovent Diskus asthma treatments. ####  ##### All four of the drugs will instead be considered “preferred alternatives,” following price negotiations between the drugmakers and Express Scripts.

"High-deductible health plans surge in popularity","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### To stem ever-escalating group health plan costs and avoid the hotly debated Cadillac tax, employers have escalated adoption of high-deductible health plans, which may mean preferred provider organization and health maintenance organization plans are on their way out. ####  ##### Employers last year continued to tweak their group plan designs as growth in health costs, plus the pressure of the 40% excise tax, made changes a priority. ####  ##### But even with the fear of the Cadillac tax, employers have steered clear of sweeping measures. ####  ##### “Because there's been relatively modest (health care cost) trend year over year, employers have not done drastic things with plan design, with or without the Affordable Care Act,” said David Fortosis, Chicago-based senior vice president and health care consultant at Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### Health care costs increased 3.2% in 2015 after employers made plan design changes, down from 4.4% in 2014, Aon Hewitt said in a November survey. That's the lowest increase recorded since Aon Hewitt began tracking the data in 1996. ####  ##### Many employers are waiting to see whether the Cadillac tax, now delayed until 2020, will be repealed before making major design changes, sources said. ####  ##### Employers most often have been “tweaking” their plan designs, Mr. Fortosis said. ####  ##### Still, small adjustments can lead to big savings, sources said. And shifting costs to employees is an obvious starting point to limit rising costs. ####  ##### “More employers are adding the high-deductible plan option, and more employers are creating stronger financial incentives for employees to enroll in that plan,” said Ed Kaplan, national health practice leader at The Segal Group Inc. in New York. HDHPs “tend to lower claim costs so that you either avoid the tax or push out the potential tax liability several years.” ####  ##### The National Business Group on Health pegs the percentage of large employers planning to offer a consumer-driven health plan in 2016 at 83% and more than one-third intend that CDHP to be the only option, according to an August survey. ####  ##### To illustrate, the medical cost per employee enrolled in a CDHP linked to a health savings account averages $9,228 compared with $11,212 for PPOs and $11,248 for HMOs, Mercer L.L.C. said in a November survey. ####  ##### Employers also are charging more to cover employee's spouses, and interest is growing in self-funding health coverage, experts say. The trend does not bode well for conventional PPOs and HMOs, some say. ####  ##### Bruce Elliott, Alexandria, Virginia-based manager of compensation and benefits at the Society for Human Resource Management, said traditional PPOs with low deductibles could eventually “could go the way of the dodo” bird. ####  ##### If PPOs and HMOs continue, “we're going to see increased deductibles, (and) we're going to see reduced coinsurance rates. In other words, they are going to put more on the employee,” he said. ####  ##### “It depends on the industry you're talking about,” said Segal's Mr. Kaplan. In retail, where salaries are lower and turnover is higher, workers may be moved into lower-cost plans. But in industries with richer benefits, such as the public sector, workers “want a rich option,” he said. ####  ##### Sometimes employees make the choice. ####  ##### At Tamarac, Florida-based City Furniture Inc., 80% of workers are in an HDHP linked to a health reimbursement arrangement, said Janet Wincko, City Furniture's vice president of employee benefits. Only 20% remain in the firm's HMO, which is extremely pricey, Ms. Wincko said. ####  ##### Also hanging in the balance is the fate of HSAs and HRAs. Without them, employees would shoulder the entire deductible and be more likely to skimp on necessary care, and employers would not be as attractive to prospective workers. ####  ##### “If (employers) are approaching the Cadillac tax thresholds, the low-hanging fruit is the HSA, which is upsetting because that's the way (employers) are offsetting the high deductible,” said Brian Marcotte, president of the NBGH in Washington. ####  ##### Employer and employee pretax contributions to HSAs, HRAs and flexible spending accounts are to be included in the Cadillac tax calculation. ####  ##### According to the NBGH survey, 58% of employers will contribute a predetermined amount to each plan participant's HSA and 59% will do so for those enrolled in HRAs in 2016. ####  ##### Those accounts are “the easiest thing for the employer to eliminate if they're either going to trigger the tax or if it's looking like it's getting close,” said Riverside, California-based Sibyl Bogardus, Hub International Ltd.'s chief compliance officer for the Western region. While only pretax contributions are counted now, she said post-tax employer contributions “may be pulled in to that calculation as well” in the future. ####  ##### And while private exchanges haven't seen the uptake initially predicted, interest continues to climb. ####  ##### According to Mercer's November study, 6% of large employers already use a private exchange for active employees or will by next year's open enrollment, a 50% increase from the year before. Furthermore, 27% of large employers are considering switching to a private exchange in the next five years. ####  ##### Much of the movement depends on the future of the Cadillac tax, sources said. #### "
"Employers strive to control health costs in anticipation of 2018 excise tax","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### Most large and midsize employers that offer health insurance to their employees are maintaining it this year, but they're still looking to limit their costs. ####  ##### Many employers face health care costs that are projected to increase in the single-digit range as well as taxes and fees related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. They're also taking steps to avoid the 40% excise tax on high-cost health plans that will go into effect in 2018. ####  ##### Based on various employer surveys, one-third to more than half of large employers are on a trajectory to hit that tax in 2018. ####  ##### “That's why we've been seeing pretty bold (cost-containment) strategies for a couple of years now,” said Tracy Watts, a Washington-based senior partner and national health reform leader at consultant Mercer L.L.C. ####  ##### For example, Mercer data shows that employers expect an average increase of 4.6% in health care costs this year, but it would have been 7.1% had they not made changes to their plans. ####  ##### In contrast to recent years, when benefits enhancements such as banning lifetime limits and expanding coverage to adult children resulted in major changes due to the ACA, 2015 is “a fairly quiet year for major plan changes among large employers,” said Randy Abbott, a Boston-based senior consultant and health and benefits group practice leader at Towers Watson & Co. ####  ##### By and large, midsize employers did not make huge benefit plan changes for 2015, although there was a continued migration to high-deductible health plans, said Rebecca McLaughlan, vice president of health and benefits at Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C., in Troy, Michigan. However, some retail and service businesses reduced worker hours or added lower-cost health plans with higher employee contribution rates to comply with the ACA's mandate to provide coverage to employees, she said. ####  ##### For the future, nearly four in five midsize to large employers expect to make some change by 2017 in benefits offered to full-time employees, according to a Towers Watson study. Benefits consultants expect even more action as 2018 approaches. Mercer estimates about one-third of employers would be subject to the excise tax without changes to their health plans. ####  ##### The excise tax, which is to be levied on plans that cost more than $10,200 a year for individuals and $27,500 for a family, could force Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. to scrap its standard preferred provider organization plan as early as 2016, said Tim Quitmeyer, the real estate management and investment firm's vice president of benefits. The company has informed its roughly 15,000 benefits-eligible U.S. employees and, for now, is taking a wait-and-see approach, he said. ####  ##### Rick Wald, Minneapolis-based director and national practice leader at Deloitte Consulting L.L.P.'s employer health care consulting practice, said “a fair number of employers (are) still holding their breath, seeing what the new Congress will do.” ####  ##### In the meantime, Jones Lang hopes to expand enrollment in its two high-deductible plans, with in-network deductibles of $1,300 to $6,750 depending on the plan and the number of people covered, through employee education and tech tools to help individuals and families gauge health care spending. ####  ##### Many employer benefit plans nudged up deductibles, coinsurance and premium contributions for 2015, several surveys show. ####  ##### Caterpillar Inc. is replacing fixed-dollar copays on certain prescription drug tiers with coinsurance due to rapidly growing costs. A spokeswoman for the Peoria, Illinois-based company declined comment, but in an overview of health benefit changes, Caterpillar said “copays have not increased since 2004 for most participants” and that brand name drugs, which the heavy equipment maker said tripled in cost in 10 years, and growing prevalence of high-cost specialty drugs were major reasons for the move. ####  ##### Employers also are migrating to high-deductible health plans. ####  ##### More than half of large employers are adding or expanding consumer-driven health plans, and those offering such plans as their only option jumped 10 percentage points to 32% this year, according to the National Business Group on Health's annual employer survey. ####  ##### New York-based McGraw-Hill Education adopted two new CDHPs this year, replacing its standard PPO and a different CDHP, according to the company's open enrollment materials. The New York-based educational content provider declined to comment. ####  ##### Roughly one-third of employers are considering a surcharge for spouses who have health insurance through their own employer or excluded spouses from coverage, according to Towers Watson data. ####  ##### Outcomes-based incentives also are becoming more prevalent, benefits experts said. Towers Watson's survey predicted a 10% increase in the number of employers taking that approach this year, with another 48% considering it for 2016 or 2017. ####  ##### Although the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed several suits challenging wellness programs that penalize employees for nonparticipation, Steve Flores, an associate in the Chicago office of Winston & Strawn L.L.P., said the law firm is not advising clients to pull the plug on wellness plans.  Until the litigation plays out, what employers can do is make sure their programs “are communicated as an incentive and not a penalty,” he said. ####  ##### Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the nation's fourth-largest school district with about 40,000 full-time benefits-eligible employees, has extended its incentive for employees to have an annual physical, participate in biometric screening and complete a health risk assessment. Employees who meet wellness goals by Sept. 30 may select a narrow-network plan with no premium for employee-only coverage. ####  ##### By encouraging employee participation in wellness activities, the district hopes to raise employee awareness of health risks and encourage them to take action that, in turn, will save the school district money. ####  ##### Facing potential excise taxes of almost $17 million in 2018 and $40 million in 2020, the school district also is exploring adding a CDHP for 2016, said Scott Clark, the district's Miami-based risk and benefits officer. ####  ##### Adding a CDHP won't solve the excise tax issue, but it will begin “to chip away at it,” said Mr. Clark, a former president of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc., adding that the district will seek proposals this year for a tool that will help employees shop for the most cost-effective health care facilities. ####  ##### While employers are interested in private health insurance exchanges to provide benefits to their workers, only 3% of large employers have made the move, according to Mercer data. ####  ##### For some employers, private exchanges are “a logical choice,” said Karen Marlo, a vice president at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. ####  ##### The retail and hospitality industries, for example, have moved to exchanges in greater numbers because many employers expanded coverage to employees who work at least 30 hours a week. But for companies doing a good job controlling costs, private exchanges are “not the right model at this time,” she said. #### "
"UPS' switch to a private health insurance exchange provides more options","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### United Parcel Service Inc. and about 8,000 of its age-65-and-older Medicare-eligible non-union retirees are reaping the benefits of the Atlanta-based package delivery company moving health care coverage to a private insurance exchange. ####  ##### For years, UPS offered a single self-insured health plan to Medicare-eligible retirees. ####  ##### “There was no choice. It was one size fits all,” said Al Rapp, corporate health care manager at UPS. “We didn't think it was a great value” in many cases for retirees. ####  ##### In 2011, UPS decided on another approach. It contracted, effective Jan. 1, 2012, with Aon Hewitt to offer coverage to the retirees through an insurance exchange — Aon Hewitt Navigators. ####  ##### Now, the retirees, depending on where they reside, can have nearly three dozen plans from which to choose to find one that best fits their health care needs. ####  ##### “We knew that providing choices would be a lot better than what retirees had before,” Mr. Rapp said. ####  ##### The retirees apply UPS contributions toward the premium charged by the plans. If the UPS contribution is more than the premium charged by the plan, retirees then can apply the difference to pay for out-of-pocket expenses, such as costs that fall under a plan's deductible. ####  ##### To prevent confusion, the exchange provides benefit advisers to help the retirees evaluate and select an appropriate health plan. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “The retirees quickly saw the value of the benefit advisers and became very positive about the change,” Mr. Rapp said. ####  ##### Retirees also can turn to exchange staff throughout the year for assistance with numerous issues, such as questions about a claim. As a result, UPS no longer has to devote corporate resources to administer the retiree program. ####  ##### “That allows us to concentrate on meeting the many other needs of our people,” Mr. Rapp said. ####  ##### Moving to a private health insurance exchange was not a cost issue as the company's retiree health care plan contribution formula has not changed. ####  ##### “It was a choice issue. We knew the plan choices would be better than what retirees had before,” Mr. Rapp said. #### "
"Alternatives to 'mini-med' health care plans are in the works","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Designs are being developed to provide affordable coverage for employees now enrolled in mini-med health care plans. ####  ##### “We're working on alternative designs” for the 20,000 to 35,000 employees and dependents covered by Western Growers Association's multiple employer welfare arrangement, including “a replacement for the 60% who are in mini-med plans,” said Jonathan Alexander, compliance counsel for the association in Irvine, Calif. ####  ##### The association is considering a plan developed by the California Health Benefit Exchange. ####  ##### “The most affordable (replacement) looks like a high-deductible health plan plus fairly robust coinsurance,” Mr. Alexander said. “It may be a replacement, but not a solution,” he said in citing higher employee costs. ####  ##### Limited-benefit or fixed-indemnity plans, which are structured differently than mini-med plans, pay a fixed amount toward hospital and doctor visits, critical illness, accidents and other charges that “are direct out-of-pocket hits” to the employee, said Christopher Covill, benefits product solution leader at Mercer L.L.C. in Atlanta. ####  ##### “There's a whole host of (supplemental) products out there today. I think there will be an absolute growth in that market,” he said. ####  ##### The fixed-indemnity plans are “excepted” from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, said Joe Murgo, president of Strategic Resource Co., a Columbia, S.C., subsidiary of Aetna Inc. specializing in limited benefit insurance plans. ####  ##### One reason that Aetna's fixed indemnity plans make coverage affordable is they access Aetna's nationwide provider network. Offered as stand-alone products now, they could supplement coverage employees obtain through an exchange to satisfy the individual mandate, he said. ####  ##### Brian Thompson, vice president of special markets for Transamerica Employee Benefits in Atlanta, said employers that offer mini-med plans have been migrating to limited-benefit plans since 2011. Transamerica offers limited benefit plans that could supplement the exchanges' plans and is developing new products “to cover the new points of risk an employee has in the market today,” he said. #### "
"Benefit changes better understood with targeted messages","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Employers that want their employees to better understand their benefits could borrow tactics used by advertisers and marketers: Know your audience and customize the message to meet their personal needs. ####  ##### So say benefits communications experts who are trying to get their clients to do just that to ensure employees know how ever-changing benefits such as health care and retirement affect them. ####  ##### “Everyone is so busy, and in this economy employees are being asked to do more with less and are being asked to manage their own benefits,” said Betsy Woods Brooks, a Stamford, Conn.-based principal in the communication practice of Buck Consultants L.L.C., adding that the shifts toward defined contribution retirement and consumer-driven health plans have helped create a maze of confusion among workers. “It's putting more personal ownership and accountability into managing your benefits. All of that requires greater understanding.” ####  ##### As a recent survey reveals and experts agree on, nearly half of employees are not getting the message. ####  ##### In December 2011, an ADP/Human Resources Pulse survey ADP HR/Benefits Pulse Survey on Employee Benefits Tools revealed that 40% of employees do not understand their benefits plans, according to human resource decision-makers. ####  ##### That figure doesn't surprise benefits communications experts, who said the challenge is multipronged: Benefits designs are calling for more employee decisions that put more power in the hands of workers, plans are more complicated than ever, and workers are bombarded with information every day, left to sift through what's important and relevant to them. ####  ##### “It's just a complicated alphabet soup for some people,” said Ann Bongiani, Seattle-based senior consultant for Towers Watson & Co. ####  ##### “There are some complicated issues on how to manage the health care system...these tend to lull people to sleep,” said P.J. Waters, a communications consultant with Lockton Cos. L.L.C. based in San Diego. “Appreciating our audience is definitely the first step.” ####  ##### “Most companies are still using a one-size-fits-all approach,” said Ms. Bongiani of what she says is one of the biggest pitfalls in presenting benefits information to employees. ####  ##### The term “targeted communications” is not a new one in the realm of human resources, but it is one that is becoming more commonplace as benefits get more complicated and the workforce more diverse. ####  ##### “Employers and human resources have always tried to emulate consumer marketers and haven't always been successful,” said Ms. Brooks of Buck Consultants. “Now they have a greater need to do that.” ####  ##### “We have to understand that our employees are in a highly customizable world now, and we need to look at how we can (accommodate) that,” said Jim Hoff, Chicago-based partner with the communication practice of Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### An obvious but often overlooked problem with human resource communications is the language barrier in many workplaces, experts say. An easy fix is to rely on translators, said Mr. Waters, whose firm is among those who provide translation as part of their service to employers. ####  ##### Next and most prominent are the various ages of employees, which experts say is tied to how certain demographics best receive information, experts say. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Robin Throckmorton, president of Cincinnati-based Strategic Human Resources Inc., a firm that provides human resources services to small and midsize companies, has examined different age groups of workers and has determined, using research and focus groups, how certain demographics like to obtain their information. ####  ##### The findings? The “radio babies,” another name for anyone born between 1930 and 1945, prefer face-to-face communication; baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, like to learn things in groups; generation X, workers born between 1965 and 1976, prefer email; and generation Y, born between 1977 and 1990, also like email but more and more prefer to receive reminders over mobile phone text messages. ####  ##### This shows that, to get the word out and explain benefits effectively, human resource professionals should use  a variety of ways to communicate (see related story). “You have to keep who you are trying to communicate with in mind when you want to get a message across,” Ms. Throckmorton said. “But you also don't want to alienate your employees.” #### "

"Stream of pricey cancer drugs to hit employer costs","Benefits Management","Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — Expensive specialty drugs, one-third of which are for cancer, give patients greater hope, but insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and employers need to find innovative ways to deal with the escalating costs. ####  ##### “If you look at the drug pipeline, it is more robust than any time in my 35 years of health care,” said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer of St. Louis-based Express Scripts Holding Co. ####  ##### More than 7,000 drugs are in development, and most are specialty medications, he said. And while all won't make it to market, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is approving a record numbers of drugs. ####  ##### While this means “tremendous hope for many unmet medical needs,” Dr. Miller said if payers “don't have solutions on how to manage specialty patients going forward, we're going to get crushed.” ####  ##### According to health care analytics firm IMS Health Inc., prescription drug spending reached $373.9 billion in 2014, up 13.1% from 2013 for the fastest growth rate since 2001. Specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C, cancer and multiple sclerosis drove much of that growth and accounted for one-third of total prescription drug spending, Danbury, Connecticut-based IMS Health said in a report last year. ####  ##### Specialty drugs are “obviously the topic that PBMs and payers are focused on, and we don't think it's going away,” said George Hill, New York-based equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank A.G. ####  ##### Buzz surrounding drug price sticker shock has focused largely on hepatitis C drugs such as Sovaldi, introduced in 2013 with a cost of about $84,000 per course of treatment; and successor Harvoni, which debuted in 2014 at an even higher $94,500 per course. ####  ##### But the biggest issue for employers and other payers is a pipeline of cancer drugs hitting the market, several experts said during the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute's Feb. 29-March 2 conference in Palm Springs, California. ####  ##### “Enormous numbers of drugs are coming out (for) cancer and they are coming out at price points we have never seen before,” Dr. Miller said. “We talk about the average chemotherapy now costing over $100,000 a year, 14 million patients with cancer — you can do the math. We're talking about an enormous spend for cancer.” ####  ##### But experts say it's hard to contain costs when it comes to cancer. ####  ##### “Most oncology drugs are covered under the medical benefit, where there is less oversight,” Mr. Hill said. “It's hard to get very aggressive in cost containment in oncology without looking terrible.” ####  ##### “Cancer was an area in benefit design that, not so many years ago, no one would touch with a 10-foot pole. You were afraid to say no,” said Sharon Frazee, vice president of research and education at Plano, Texas-based PBMI. ####  ##### Still, she said, employers and other payers are “less afraid, more willing to say, ""Let's make reasoned choices; let's work together to do this,' and to explain to people why this drug is preferred over that drug,” she said, adding there's always an appeals process for patients with a medical necessity. ####  ##### Employers and other payers are using cost-sharing tiers and formulary exclusions to control specialty drug costs, experts said. ####  ##### Express Scripts is poised to tackle cancer drug prices using indication-based pricing, which means it will pay more for a drug when it's used for more effective treatment. For example, the PBM will reimburse the drugmaker at a higher rate when Tarceva is used to fight lung cancer versus pancreatic cancer, because the drug is more effective in treating lung cancer, Dr. Miller said. ####  ##### “It's basically disincentiving the overuse of drugs that have very little impact on survival,” Ms. Frazee said. ####  ##### Yet the conversation about high drug prices may help ultimately lower them, Mr. Hill said. ####  ##### “Even the Republicans are talking about drug pricing and drug price control,” he said. “If you continue to gouge the system, you will draw the ire of regulators on both sides.” #### "
"IRS signals grad student health plans need overhaul","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Health Insurers"," ##### The IRS has given colleges and universities more time to scrap long-established health insurance plans offered to student teaching assistants and devise new approaches, but the plans' end looks to be in sight. ####  ##### In Notice 2016-73, the IRS affirmed earlier guidance that a widespread approach colleges and universities use to provide health coverage to students — typically graduate teaching assistants — flunks provisions of the health care reform law. ####  ##### In what the IRS calls “employer payment” plans, schools buy and pay most or all of the premium  for individual policies purchased from commercial insurers. ####  ##### “These arrangements, by their very definition, include dollar limits on the amount of reimbursements or payments, and therefore violate the Affordable Care Act prohibition on annual dollar limits,” the IRS said in its February notice. ####  ##### “The IRS views these students as employees, and therefore you cannot subsidize the cost of individual policies for them,” said Steven Bloom, director of federal relations at the American Council on Education in Washington. ####  ##### The IRS is saying, “No employer can reimburse an employee for all or some of the premium for individual health insurance,” said Rich Stover, a principal at Xerox HR Services in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### Still, the IRS said it recognizes “schools may need additional time to adopt a suitable alternative or make other arrangements to come into compliance,” and said its rules would not apply for student health plan years starting prior to Jan. 1, 2017. ####  ##### Since health plans typically start with the beginning of college and university academic years in the fall, many schools will have about 18 months to devise new approaches. ####  ##### “This is something colleges and universities will have to address, but at least they will have time,” said J.D. Piro, a senior vice president at Aon Hewitt in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### Benefit experts say colleges and universities will consider several approaches: extending their group health plans to working students, such as teaching assistants, and giving students cash, which they could use to purchase health insurance coverage. ####  ##### “I think many colleges/universities will work to extend eligibility for the employer-sponsored group health plan. This is probably going to end up being the easiest approach because the group health administration structure is already there,” said Jen Faifer, a principal at Mercer L.L.C. in Chicago. ####  ##### The “approach will vary by school depending on needs and student issues,” Xerox's Mr. Stover said. ####  ##### Some schools hope Congress may intervene to block the rules. ####  ##### “The major research universities across the country have mobilized their congressional delegations to address the IRS ruling so that beginning in 2017, we may be able to continue to offer the same insurance coverage that we have always offered,” said a spokeswoman for University of Missouri in Columbia. ####  ##### “We have not given up hope,” said the Mr. Bloom of the American Council on Education. “We are exploring avenues on Capitol Hill. I don't believe this is what the White House thought that this is what the ACA intended to do.” ####  ##### “Colleges and universities are likely to develop some alternative scenarios, but wait until after the election to decide whether to implement them,” said Amy Bergner, managing director of people and organization at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P in Washington. ####  ##### But others doubt Congress will intervene. ####  ##### “It is unlikely that Congress would pass and President Obama would sign legislation impacting the reach of the ACA,” said Andy Anderson, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### In fact, colleges and universities recognize that congressional intervention or the IRS changing its position are far from certain. ####  ##### “Depending on what the relevant agencies advise us, we may have to find a new solution to the problem. While we cannot predict what the agencies will do, we can predict our own institutional behavior,” the University of Missouri spokeswoman said. #### "
"Towers Watson risk transfer program aims to offload retiree health care risks","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### A program that applies aspects of the pension plan risk-reduction concept to employers' retiree health care exposures could provide financial relief to some employers, experts say. ####  ##### But the significant upfront investment needed might be a deterrent, some say. The program, unveiled last week by Towers Watson & Co., would enable employers to eliminate unfunded retiree health care plan liabilities for Medicare-eligible retirees by shifting those liabilities to insurers through the purchase of group annuities. ####  ##### “Retiree health care plan liabilities are a big, big issue for some employers,” said Michael Newman, a partner with the law firm Barger & Wolen L.L.P. in Los Angeles.  “A lot of employers want to defuse those liabilities, but many will wait and see” for results before deciding, Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Under the program, employers would first have to adopt a defined contribution approach for health care coverage offered to Medicare-eligible retirees.  Under that approach, employers agree to make a fixed contribution towards the premiums of health care plans available through Towers Watson's private exchange, with retirees picking up the difference between the credit provided by their employers and the cost of the plan they select. ####  ##### In the risk transfer program, the employer would purchase, paying the full premium upfront, a group annuity from an insurer. The insurer then would provide retirees with a monthly tax-free check, which a retiree would put towards the premium of the plan he or she selects in the Towers Watson Exchange, known as OneExchange, through which dozens of insurers offer coverage. ####  ##### Through the approach, which Towers Watson calls Longitude Solution, an employer would fully shift its retiree health care liabilities, including unknown factors of retiree longevity, to an insurer. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Retiree health care “benefits do not engage or attract new talent, yet they create balance sheet volatility and income statement expense, and divert management time,” Towers Watson said in a written analysis describing the program, claiming those factors would be eliminated through its risk transfer approach. ####  ##### “This seems to be answering an employer need:  to make retiree health care costs more predictable,” Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Towers Watson now is discussing the approach with clients “and there is considerable employer interest,” said Mitchell Cole, Stamford, Conn.-based managing director of Towers Watson Retiree Insurance Solutions. Towers Watson declined to identify the names of these employers. ####  ##### “It is a risk management mechanism.  It will be undoubtedly used more and more. Some employers will flock to it because it limits their risks,” said Brian Klepper, chief executive officer of the National Business Coalition on Health in Washington. ####  ##### “It is an interesting option for companies to consider especially those that want to eliminate retiree health care obligations from their financial balance sheets,” said Michael Thompson, a principal with Pricewaterhouse-Coopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### Still, experts say, employers have to consider other issues. For example, unlike pension benefits, employers typically have not funded retiree health care benefits. That would mean employers would have to come up with the cash upfront to pay for the group annuity from the insurer they selected. ####  ##### “Employers would have to write a pretty big check. Many companies would rather pay this cost annually than write such a big check right away,” said John Grosso, head of Aon Hewitt's retiree health care task force in Norwalk, Conn. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The approach is a tradeoff, said Bruce Richards, a partner and chief actuary for health care at Mercer L.L.C. in Richmond, Va. ####  ##### On the one hand, employers could improve their balance sheets, which Mr. Richards said, is a good way for employers to improve their credit ratings. ####  ##### “This will help in keeping your income and balance sheets clean,” Mr. Richards said. ####  ##### On the other hand, purchasing the annuity means an employer will have less money for investments from which it could have earned income, Mr. Richards said. ####  ##### Such risk transfers have been common in the pension arena. In 2012, for example, more than a dozen major employers, including Equifax Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., NCR Corp. and the New York Times Co., offered employees who left but who were not yet receiving benefits, the opportunity to convert their future monthly annuity into a cash lump sum benefit, eliminating an unpredictable future cost and overhead expenses, such as payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### Also, General Motors Co. and Verizon Inc. bought group annuities from Prudential Insurance Co. of America, shifting to Prudential billions of dollars in pension benefits promised to current retirees. #### "
"Coventry acquisition helps Aetna report increased revenue and profit","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, P/C Insurers, Aetna, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### Propelled largely by its successful acquisition of Coventry Health Care Inc., Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Inc. posted the strongest 2013 performance among the five largest publicly traded U.S. health insurers. ####  ##### Aetna grew its annual revenue 29.2% and its net income 15.4% in 2013. It added nearly 4 million new members, including about 1.4 million fully-insured commercial members. ####  ##### Aetna was the only top-tier health insurer that increased enrollments in both its fully insured and self-insured commercial medical segments, as well as its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid segments. ####  ##### “Aetna hit the mark on a number of the metrics that we're interested in. Revenue growth and income growth obviously are among them, but also diversity growth,” said Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Services Inc. ####  ##### “They added a lot of business in the Coventry acquisition, which gives them a lot of new access to growth in some markets where they weren't as strongly represented, both geographically and productwise,” he said. ####  ##### Analysts said Aetna's investment in its private health insurance exchange, Aetna Marketplace, which it launched for small employer groups last year and plans to expand this year, and its participation in several national and regional third-party exchange platforms have positioned it for organic growth in its employer-sponsored segment. ####  ##### “While insurers face real and well-documented headwinds related to (health care reform law) implementation, Aetna's core business continues to grow and evolve,” said Jennifer Lynch, a research analyst at New York-based BMO Capital Markets. “We like the company's dedication to full-risk health insurance and believe, through its proprietary exchange and participation in competing ones, Aetna will harness commercial revenue and earnings growth.” #### "
"How to carefully evaluate third-party administrator pricing","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### TPA pricing ranges from a single administrative services fee to a menu of services with separate prices, making it difficult to make side-by-side comparisons. ####  ##### “It's like going to the grocery store and looking at the fruit stall: apples, oranges, peaches, pears,” said Fred Hunt, active past president of the Society of Professional Benefit Administrators, a Chevy Chase, Md.-based national TPA association. ####  ##### Donald Mollihan, a partner at Phoenix-based Arizona Benefits Consultants L.L.C., has seen TPA prices for claims administration as low as $14 and as high as $25 per employee per month. ####  ##### Depending on its size, an employer group could be charged $30 to $50 per month per employee for all administrative, network and care management services, said Carol Berry, Woodland Hills, Calif.-based chief operating officer of the Health Care Administrators Association, whose members include TPAs. ####  ##### Adam Russo, co-founder and CEO of The Phia Group L.L.C., a Braintree, Mass.-based cost-containment and consulting firm, said price should be the last thing employers consider. ####  ##### One TPA may have a lower administrative fee, but if it relies heavily on computer software to pay or deny claims with little human intervention, a company may end up paying more on claims than it should, he said. ####  ##### “I would rather be with an administrator who's a little bit pricier for admin fees, but I know they have checks and balances in place,” Mr. Russo said. ####  ##### He also thinks employers focus too much on provider network discounts. ####  ##### “Thirty percent off a number — and you don't even know what it is — may or may not be better than 10% off another number,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Mollihan asks TPAs for a breakout of costs and compares options using a spreadsheet. “You have to look at what's included in their fee structure,” he said. #### "
"Periodic requests for third-party administrator proposals can benefit employers","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### Last May, the City of Manhattan, Kan., began soliciting proposals for a third-party administrator to provide services this year. ####  ##### With the exception of 2007, the incumbent for the city's group health plan had served the city from its Wichita, Kan., office since 1998 under various names and owners, most recently as Harrington Health Services Inc. ####  ##### Tampa, Fla.-based HealthPlan Services purchased Harrington Health in March 2011. With the latest ownership change and subsequent staffing cuts, the city no longer thought it was receiving the same level of service and decided to seek new bids, said Cathy Harmes, director of human resources. ####  ##### “It grieved me greatly to have to do it,” she said, but it had been five years since the city had considered a new TPA request for proposals. ####  ##### Harrington submitted a proposal, but it did not make the final cut. ####  ##### “We greatly enjoyed our relationship with them. We were definitely sorry when they decided to terminate their relationship with us,” said Larry Schmidt, vice president of claims, in Harrington Health's Westerville, Ohio, headquarters. ####  ##### With several years of self-funding experience, Manhattan officials knew they wanted to preserve certain elements of their 800-member group health plan. ####  ##### With its new TPA, Overland Park, Kan.,-based CoreSource, a unit of Trustmark Mutual Holding Co., the city retained its grandfathered health plan status and saved roughly $70,000 in fixed costs over 2012. The city also negotiated a new stop-loss agreement that will save $700,000 this year. ####  ##### Harrington's proposal, by contrast, projected a 25% increase in fees for 2014. ####  ##### CoreSource provided continued access to Cigna Corp.'s preferred provider organization network, minimizing employee and dependent disruption while keeping the city's wellness plan. It also continued the city's prescription program and manages direct contracts with local hospitals, physicians, surgeons and other providers — a critical element that yields “better discounts than we could have gotten through Cigna,” Ms. Harmes said. ####  ##### “Do your analysis,” she advised employers looking to change TPAs. Pay close attention to provider discounts and make sure the service agreement language is acceptable before signing the contract, she said. #### "
"Pharmacy benefit manager merger seen driving competition","Benefits Management","Prescription Drug Benefits, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### ROCKVILLE, Md.—The $4.4 billion purchase by SXC Health Solutions Corp. of Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. is likely to increase competition among the industry's largest pharmacy benefit managers and could drive prescription discounts for major employers, expert say. ####  ##### The deal announced last week also is a sign that more PBM mergers and acquisitions are on the horizon as companies cope with drug pricing pressures. ####  ##### “We're just at the beginning of acquisitions in this space,” said Brenda Motheral, executive director of the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute in Plano, Texas. ####  ##### SXC and Catalyst said the boards of directors of each company unanimously approved the merger in which Catalyst shareholders will receive $28 in cash and a 0.66 share of SXC stock for each Catalyst share under the transaction, the firms said in a joint statement. ####  ##### The pending acquisition would create an estimated $13 billion company that would be headquartered in Illinois and maintain offices in Maryland, according to last week's statement. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2012, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. ####  ##### SXC reported $4.98 billion in 2011 revenue, while Catalyst reported $5.33 billion in revenue, the PBMs said in their annual reports. ####  ##### Employers are hopeful the merger will result in a major PBM market player that can negotiate prescription pricing deals, said Edward Kaplan, New York-based senior vp and national health practice leader at The Segal Co., an independent benefit, compensation and human resources firm. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “You get to a point where you're big enough where the big manufacturers have to take you seriously, and that should help them negotiate rebate savings,” Mr. Kaplan said. ####  ##### The institute's Ms. Motheral agreed that the deal could mean more prescription discounts. ####  ##### “For larger employers, this is probably pretty positive because it gives another option of a player who can compete effectively,” she said. ####  ##### SXC and Catalyst face competition from PBMs that are several times their size. Medco Health Solutions Inc. of Franklin Lakes, N.J., ranked No. 1 in the Business Insurance 2011 ranking of the 10 largest PBMs, with $66 billion in unbundled PBM revenues for 2010. ####  ##### Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS Caremark Corp. ranked No. 2 in the 2011 ranking, reporting $47.8 billion in unbundled PBM revenues in 2010. St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. was No. 3 with nearly $45 billion in unbundled PBM revenues. ####  ##### Citing Express Scripts' deal earlier this month to buy Medco for $29.1 billion, Ms. Motheral said consolidation in the PBM market is being driven largely by decreasing margins in the mail-order pharmacy business. ####  ##### During a conference call with analysts last week, SXC CEO Mark Thierer said SXC and Catalyst—which have specialized in mid-market clients—plan to compete directly against larger PBMs. ####  ##### “The combination brings together two highly complementary businesses, which collectively will have an increased scale and scope to better control drug costs and deliver customized solutions to payers, including employers, health plans and government clients,” said Mr. Thierer, who will remain CEO of the combined company whose stock will trade under the SXC symbol. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### While SXC and Catalyst separately are much smaller than the top PBMs, their combined strength could help them double in size during the next five years, said Brian Tanquilut, a Nashville-based health care services equity research analyst with Jefferies & Co. Inc. ####  ##### “This allows them to play offense and really try to go head-to-head with the larger PBMs to gain as much market share as possible,” Mr. Tanquilut said. ####  ##### Brooks O'Neil, Minneapolis-based senior research analyst with Dougherty & Co. L.L.C., said SXC is known for having a sophisticated information technology structure. That system, along with increased negotiation power, could make SXC-Catalyst a strong contender to the top PBMs, Mr. O'Neil said. ####  ##### “You need to be able to help your clients manage their pharmacy costs in the ways that are most comfortable for them and you need to be able to deliver exceptional quality of care to members,” Mr. O'Neil said. ####  ##### SXC and Catalyst may look to gain customers from Express Scripts and Medco as that merger shakes out, Mr. Tanquilut said. ####  ##### “There are lots of clients that are evaluating their relationship with Express Scripts right now, so there's a lot of opportunity for these guys to pick up...market share,” Mr. Tanquilut said. ####  ##### As the Express Scripts and SXC mergers move forward, the institute's Ms. Motheral said other PBMs likely will consider similar deals in order to stay competitive. ####  ##### “I suspect we'll see one (deal) every quarter for the next 18 months or so,” she said. #### "
"Q&A: James Klein, American Benefits Council","Benefits Management","Benefits Management"," ##### Before its current term ends in June, the U.S. Supreme Court will hand down a ruling that will affect millions of U.S. residents: the legality of a portion of 2012 IRS rules that authorize federal health insurance premium subsidies to eligible lower-income individuals receiving coverage through the federal insurance exchange. James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington, which represents employers on a wide range of benefit issues, discussed the potential ramifications of the high court's upcoming ruling with Business Insurance Editor-at-Large Jerry Geisel. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: If the court were to strike down the IRS rules, millions of people receiving subsidies would lose them. Would there be an impact on employers as well? ####  ##### A: The impact would be mixed. On the one hand, some employers who do not offer coverage or offer unaffordable coverage would avoid most or all (Affordable Care Act) penalties, since the penalties only apply when an employee goes into an exchange, is eligible for a subsidy and uses the subsidy to purchase coverage. Since the employees would not be eligible for a subsidy in certain exchanges, no penalty on the employer would accrue. ####  ##### On the other hand, for employers who may be looking long term to transition out of employer sponsorship, the viability of exchanges, or lack thereof, is a very important factor in that decision. ####  ##### Q: If the justices strike down the rules, is it likely the decision would be effective immediately? ####  ##### A: There were some clues during oral arguments that they would delay the effective date, recognizing the chaos that would ensue. ####  ##### If that decision is made by the court, they will find a way to defer the effective date, at least to next year. ####  ##### Q: If the rules were struck down, how would Congress respond? ####  ##### A: Republicans and Democrats have reasons to find a patch to enable the more than 7.5 million people who would lose subsidies to enable them to continue coverage. ####  ##### Ironically, a calamitous decision like that could lay the groundwork for a deal between Republicans and Democrats on making various changes to the ACA, including the continuation of some subsidies. ####  ##### Q: Alternatively, would you predict a rush by states to set up their own exchanges to ensure their eligible residents can continue to receive premium subsidies? ####  ##### A: Some of them would want to do that. It would be more difficult, though, to do that in some states, like Texas and Missouri, which have passed laws that explicitly prohibit their governors to work with the federal government to set up exchanges. I think, though, that some states and the Obama administration would try to be as flexible as possible, having states contract with the federal government to operate the exchange and deeming that to be a state-established exchange. We would see a variety of different responses from the different states. ####  ##### Q: If the court upholds the rule, could that decision lead to congressional agreements in other areas? ####  ##### A: The result would not be chaotic if the court upholds the subsidies. Neither, though, would we see the status quo. I think the Obama administration would react and say, “Look, twice there have been moves to invalidate the law, and they have failed.” ####  ##### Republicans will say, “We are very disappointed with this  outcome. We need to use every procedural tool at our disposal to repeal or make changes to the law.” Either result will result in some significant legislative activity. ####  ##### Q: And what is your prediction as to how the court will rule? ####  ##### A: I predict a 5-4 ruling upholding the subsidies, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing the decision. #### "
"Private health exchanges help introduce defined contribution approach","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### The rapid development of private health insurance exchanges over the past two years have helped implant the defined contribution approach in how employers offer coverage to their employees. ####  ##### The new approach is an alternative to the model used for decades where employers paid a certain percentage of group health care plan premiums, typically 60% to 80% but were largely unshielded from big cost increases in years when group health care premiums soared. ####  ##### With the advent of private health insurance exchanges, which Accenture P.L.C. projects will have 40 million people enrolled as of 2018, many employers have paired offering employees the ability to choose plans provided through exchanges with  another approach: paying a specific amount toward employees' health care premiums with workers paying the rest. ####  ##### “There is no question that private exchanges are a viable way to introduce a defined contribution approach” to health insurance coverage, said Randy Abbott, a senior consultant at Towers Watson & Co. in Boston. ####  ##### In addition, the employer premium often will be adjusted depending on the employee's choice of single or family coverage, while some employers tie their contribution to employee income. ####  ##### “In the private exchange environment, each employee is allocated a set amount of money to spend on the benefit plans that suit their individual and family needs,” said Steve Heckert, vice president of human resources in Clearwater, Florida, for GFI Software, which offers employees a choice of six plans through the Bright Choices exchange. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### That last feature has a special relevance to a health care reform law provision that imposes a penalty on employers if the premium employees have to pay for single coverage exceeds 9.5% of their wages. ####  ##### “The employer wants to make sure that employees won't bump against the 9.5% threshold,” said Sherri Bockhorst, a principal and national practice leader at Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s health exchange solutions division in St. Louis. ####  ##### Through the defined contribution approach, employers can budget spending on health care programs and be reasonably certain that budget will not be exceeded. ####  ##### “It comes down to meeting certain budget targets for their health care benefits programs,” said Eric Grossman, a senior partner and exchange business leader with Mercer L.L.C. in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### “Employers want their costs to be more predictable,” said Jim Winkler, Aon Hewitt's chief innovation officer for health and benefits in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### Such an approach also gives employers some flexibility, Mr. Grossman said. For example, employers may vary their premium contribution by employees' income and behavior, such as whether or not they smoke. ####  ##### The employer's approach also can provide a greater incentive for employees to choose a less costly health plan. For example, some employers design their programs so employees who do choose a less costly plan can apply the difference to pay for uncovered expenses, such as deductibles. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### There are some signs that the defined contribution approach, coupled with exchanges, are helping to hold down cost increases.   For example, an Aon Hewitt analysis found that health premiums for the three original employers in its exchange rose by an average of 5.1% in 2014 compared with  2013. ####  ##### That 5.1% increase is somewhat less than average cost increases of 6% to 7% that Aon Hewitt and others earlier had projected for the large employer market. ####  ##### Still, as plan costs rises, employers are likely to increase how much they pay toward employees' coverage, consultants say. ####  ##### Retiree health coverage, though, is another matter. ####  ##### Among employers that still offer such coverage, many have permanently set how much they will contribute toward retirees' health coverage. ####  ##### “Many employers have put in a cap” on retiree health coverage, said Aon Hewitt's Mr. Winkler. ####  ##### “The cap is a way of controlling the liabilities,” said Michael Thompson, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### When the cap is hit, private health insurance exchanges give retirees more options to which to apply the company's contribution, Mr. Winkler said. #### "
"Different variables affect limits on employees' 401(k) pretax contributions","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### How much in pretax contributions employees can make to their 401(k) plans is based on federal law and the design of the plan. ####  ##### Under federal law, the maximum pretax contribution employees generally can make to their 401(k) plan in 2014 is $17,500. ####  ##### In addition, the total contribution by the employee and employer is capped at $52,000 this year. ####  ##### Depending on certain variables, however, employees may be able to contribute more or less than $17,500. ####  ##### Under a Tax Code provision Congress made permanent in 2006, employees age 50 and older can make each year additional so-called catch-up contributions. The maximum catch-up contribution is $5,500 this year. ####  ##### However, highly compensated employees — those earning at least $115,000 this year — may be limited to less than the $17,500 maximum if their employer's 401(k) plan does not pass statutory nondiscrimination tests.  Under those tests, the average contributions of highly compensated employees cannot exceed the rate of rank-and-file employees by statutorily set amounts. ####  ##### Still, an employer can avoid the nondiscrimination testing if it adopts what is known as safe harbor 401(k) plan design. ####  ##### To qualify, for example, for one widely utilized safe harbor, an employer must match 100% of employees' deferrals up to the first 3% of pay and 50% of deferrals on the next 2% of pay. This option is the more popular, benefit consultants say. ####  ##### To qualify for another safe harbor, an employer must automatically contribute to employees' 401(k) accounts an amount equal to 3% of pay. #### "
"Employers boost 401(k) programs as pension plans get phased out","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits"," ##### Employers are tweaking and sweetening their 401(k) plans as increasingly the programs become the sole retirement savings vehicle offered by many companies. ####  ##### Higher company matches and the introduction of automatic enrollment features have been implemented as employers seek to boost retirement savings plans while they phase out their defined benefit pension plans. ####  ##### While 401(k) plans once were viewed as arrangements to supplement corporate pension plans that provided a specific monthly benefit, unpredictable costs due to fluctuating investments and interest rates prompted employers to move away from those plans to the greater cost certainty of 401(k) and other defined contribution plans. ####  ##### As recently as 1998, 90% of Fortune 100 companies offered defined benefit plans to new salaried employees, according to Towers Watson & Co. By last year, though, just 30% of Fortune 100 companies still offered them (see chart below). ####  ##### The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s insurance program, to which employers with defined benefit plans must pay insurance premiums, covered more than 100,000 such plans in 1985. Today, it's just 22,000 plans. ####  ##### At the same time, the number of 401(k) plans has skyrocketed leaping from just over 200,000 in 1995 to more than 500,000 in 2011, according to a Labor Department report citing the most recent year definitive statistics are available. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In response, many employers have beefed up their 401(k) plans to compensate in varying degrees for the loss of retirement income employees would have received from their now-frozen or terminated defined benefit plans. ####  ##### “Employers want to do what they can so that employees are saving enough,” said Rob Austin, director of retirement research in the Charlotte, North Carolina, office of Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### A major way employers have done that is sweetening the formula used to determine how much they will match employees' 401(k) contributions. ####  ##### For example, the most popular employer match now — used in 19% of plans — is one in which employers match 100% of employees' salary deferrals, up to the first 6% of pay.  By contrast, in 2001, the most common match — used in 21% of plans — was one in which employers matched 50% of salary deferrals, up to the first 6% of pay, according to Aon Hewitt data. ####  ##### Total contributions that can be made in a year depend on the employer's plan design and the employee's pay (see story at right). ####  ##### Some employers, especially those that have frozen their defined benefit plans, have done even more. For example, when IBM Corp. froze its defined benefit plans in 2008, it added an automatic employer contribution feature. ####  ##### Under that enhancement, participants in the cash balance pension plan that IBM froze received a dollar-for-dollar 401(k) plan match on employee contributions, up to the first 6% of pay, and an automatic company contribution equal to 2% of pay. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “When companies freeze their defined benefit plans, some may feel two steps are necessary” for their remaining 401(k) plan, said Jack Abraham, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Chicago, referring to a sweetened company match and an automatic employer contribution. ####  ##### Another design change that has taken hold is automatic enrollment — now offered by nearly 60% of employers with 401(k) plans vs. less than 20% in 2005, according to Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### That approach paid off for Hendrick Automotive Group in Charlotte, North Carolina. Employee participation in the company's 401(k) plan surged to 80% when the company added an automatic enrollment feature in 2011, up from 60% before automatic enrollment was added, said Andrea Darrow, manager of retirement programs. ####  ##### “We want to take care of our employees and be sure they have a nest egg to fall back on,” Ms. Darrow said. ####  ##### In fact, “automatic enrollment has been wildly successful” for employers, said Sandra Pappa, a Pittsburgh-based principal in Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s retirement practice. ####  ##### According to Aon Hewitt research, the average participation rate of employees subject to automatic enrollment is 84.6%, compared with just 62.4% for employees who are not. ####  ##### But not all design changes have been positively received. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### For example, AOL Inc. reversed course earlier this year following a barrage of employee complaints about the internet provider's decision to match employees' 401(k) contributions at the end of the year instead of each pay period. ####  ##### “We heard you on this topic. And as we discussed the matter over several days, with management and employees, we have decided to change the policy back to a per-pay-period matching contribution,” AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong told employees in an email. ####  ##### The motivation to reduce the frequency of matching contributions is simple: Employers can reduce their costs. ####  ##### “If you have a lot of turnover, you can save money and reward those who stay with the company,” said Robyn Credico, national director of defined contribution consulting at Towers Watson & Co. in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Just 8% of employers that match employee contributions do so only once a year, with 86% matching contributions during each pay period, according to Aon Hewitt. #### "

"Meredith DeMartino helps make Event Network family friendly","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### When Meredith DeMartino entered the University of Albany in New York in the early 1990s as a marketing and finance major, she imagined that one day she would end up working on Wall Street. ####  ##### Instead, she began a career in human resources at Micro Interactive Inc., a multimedia startup firm in New York City, soon after graduating in 1995. ####  ##### “I was employee No. 15,” she said. “And they just started to grow, and I started to get involved with helping them with the growth from the talent acquisition, or recruiting, aspect. And then as we got larger, there was a need to really take on that HR role. I loved it so much, I ended up leaving that organization so I could go to a larger organization where I could truly learn the corporate HR function.” ####  ##### What Ms. DeMartino likes best about being in human resources is the fact that it also allows her to put what she calls her “numbers side” to use, especially when she is working on benefits programs. ####  ##### An opportunity to become compensation and benefits manager at Carlsbad, Calif.-based Dot Hill Systems Corp. brought her to the West Coast in 2001, and she went back to school at night, earning her master's degree in business administration at California State University San Marcos in 2003. ####  ##### She became attracted to Event Network Inc. in San Diego when efforts to meet up for a business dinner with President Larry Gilbert, one of the company's founders, didn't pan out. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “He suggested we meet for breakfast instead because he said he made a point of having dinner with his family every night at 5:30,” she said. ####  ##### Ms. DeMartino continues to espouse Event Network's family-friendly culture through the design and implementation of the company's benefits programs, including its on-site garden plots, its “family kitchens” and its regular support of community volunteer work. ####  ##### Family members also are encouraged to participate in Event Network's many wellness challenges and in annual enrollment meetings, which are held via conference call because most of the niche retailer's 1,250 employees work remotely in stores away from the company's San Diego headquarters. ####  ##### Further perpetuating the familial tone of the firm is the way cubicles and offices are labeled. Instead of traditional employee name plates, colorful plaques list biographical information that provides a glimpse into each resident's unique personality. Ms. DeMartino's plaque, for example, shows that she hails from Dix Hills, N.Y., and she has a 20-pound black-and-white cat named Roxy. ####  ##### She and her husband, Chris, a graphic designer who operates his own business out of their home in nearby Carlsbad, also have two young sons: Ryan, 6, and Brady, 3. #### "
"Event Network wellness program reduces 'health age'","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### While many employers are struggling with the effects of an aging workforce, Event Network Inc. has discovered the fountain of youth. ####  ##### By supporting a healthier lifestyle, Event Network's corporate wellness programs are helping to make its workforce physiologically younger by effectively reducing the “health age” of employees compared with their chronological ages. ####  ##### Though the average age of an Event Network employee is 38, employees' “health age” averages 36.6. ####  ##### The Health Age calculator that Event Network uses was developed by WellSource Inc., a health risk assessment and wellness program vendor in Clackamas, Ore. The calculator is based on the 1974 “Health and Ways of Living Study” that examined the health practices of 6,928 people in Alameda County, Calif., for 15 years and determined which were tied to longevity. The study found that people who followed all or nearly all of 10 good health habits identified by researchers lived an average of 12.5 years longer than those not following such a healthy lifestyle. ####  ##### The 10 key good health habits are: ####  ##### • Physical activity: Thirty minutes most days of the week reduces risk for many diseases. ####  ##### • Not smoking: Smoking can reduce life expectancy by up to eight years. ####  ##### • Body weight: People with a body mass index below 25 live longer. ####  ##### • Reduced red meat in the diet. ####  ##### • Eating three or more whole grain foods a day, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks. ####  ##### • Eating five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily. ####  ##### • Eating about an ounce of nuts daily, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks. ####  ##### • Maintaining a happy, hopeful outlook. Unhappiness erodes mental and physical health. ####  ##### • Having the social support of friends, family and groups. ####  ##### • Getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night. ####  ##### The health age is calculated based on proprietary scoring algorithms developed by WellSource that compare the results of the original study against the number of good health practices employees follow, using their collective responses to strategic questions in an annual online health risk assessment. #### "

Right now, this is campaign rhetoric,” said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. ####  ##### “Who will be on the hook for the cost? The devil will be in the details,” said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington. ####  ##### Ms. Clinton is not the first to propose lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Her husband and then-President Bill Clinton did so nearly twenty years ago. ####  ##### “What about all those people who retire at age 55 and lose their employer-based health insurance and can't draw Medicare until they're 65?” he asked during a speech to the Service Employees International Union in 1997. ####  ##### A year later, the Clinton administration formalized the proposal that would have allowed employees 55 and older who lost their jobs and exhausted COBRA coverage to purchase Medicare coverage for $400 per month until they turned 65. But Congress never acted on the plan. ####  ##### Benefit experts see pros and cons from an employer perspective in Ms. Clinton's proposal, which could affect 13 million people, according to an analysis last week by Washington-based consultant Avalere Health L.L.C. ####  ##### On the negative side, expanding Medicare to younger retirees could lead to more provider cost-shifting to those covered by employer plans. ####  ##### “Won't they jack up rates even more for those not on Medicare?” Mr. Gelfand asked. ####  ##### On the positive side, employers could partially offset early retirees' costs by contributing to health reimbursement arrangements to partially offset Medicare premiums. ####  ##### Indeed, some employers today make HRA contributions that Medicare-eligible retirees can tap to pay premiums for Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and Part D, which provides coverage for prescription drugs, said Sharon Cohen, a principal at Xerox HR Services in Washington. ####  ##### Others say the proposal's appeal would rest on a key detail Ms. Clinton has yet to provide: how much, if anything, the government would pay. ####  ##### “We don't know yet what it means to buy in. That has important implications for the government and for individuals,” said Kathryn Wilber, senior counsel of health policy at the American Benefits Council in Washington. ####  ##### Whether Congress would take up a lower Medicare-eligibility age proposal isn't known. Legislators, though, almost certainly would hold back if the cost weakened Medicare's financial health, Mr. Wojcik said. ####  ##### “This could accelerate the time table on when Medicare is projected to become insolvent, especially if there is adverse selection,” Mr. Wojick said. ####  ##### Last year, Medicare trustees projected the program will become insolvent by 2030. #### "
"Wearables for wellness fit right in","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, UnitedHealth Group, Health Care Costs, Technology"," ##### Many employers are embedding wearable fitness-tracking devices in workplace wellness programs. ####  ##### From simple step counters to sophisticated sensors that capture activity levels, heart rate and sleep patterns, wearables have become a popular tool to promote healthy lifestyles. ####  ##### Jessica Grossmeier, vice president of research at the Health Enhancement Research Organization in Edina, Minnesota, said employers that integrate wearables into robust, year-round wellness programs are seeing strong employee participation. ####  ##### “They're saying, ""Oh my goodness, this really gave our (wellness) program lift,'” said Ms. Grossmeier, who also is CEO of Verity Analytics. ####  ##### HERO's 2015 Wearables in Wellness survey found that 46% of employers offer some type of fitness tracker as part of a wellness program. Of those, half or more said they offer the devices to increase users' physical activity (94%) and healthy habits (62%), boost employee engagement (77%), and add fun and excitement to wellness initiatives (58%). ####  ##### Wearable device manufacturers such as Fitbit Inc. and Garmin Ltd. are part of the employer wellness space, but other players also are entering the market. ####  ##### In March, insurance giant UnitedHealthcare Inc. and technology partner Qualcomm Inc. unveiled UnitedHealthcare Motion, a wellness program built around custom-designed fitness trackers. Employees enrolled in the insurer's high-deductible health plans can earn up to $1,460 annual financial incentives for meeting daily walking goals as tracked by the device. The data is sent to an app via a platform that complies with federal patient privacy and security requirements. A smartphone app that syncs with the fitness tracker will allow iPhone and Android users to monitor their walking results and financial incentives. ####  ##### A spokesman for UnitedHealthcare said the program is available to businesses with 10 to 500 employees and that the insurer plans to expand it to larger employers later this year. ####  ##### Wellness programs are all about providing personalized support for employees and their families in their well-being journeys, and “wearables feed into that,” said LuAnn Heinen, vice president of workforce well-being, productivity and human capital at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. “They make health fun and social.” ####  ##### Some employers provide wearables free of charge. Others subsidize them or invite employees to bring their own fitness device. ####  ##### Atlanta's Emory University and Emory Healthcare hospital and clinic system piloted a Fitbit tracker at five sites in 2014 during an eight-week Move More Challenge. Employees received a basic version of the device for free with the option to “buy up” to a more sophisticated model, said Michael Staufacker, director of health management at Emory University. ####  ##### The test, however, found a big hole: 14% of employees who got the freebie never bothered to sync it to the manufacturer's website or mobile app. In contrast, just 4% of employees who upgraded never used the device. ####  ##### With the full rollout last year, Emory offered eligible employees a $30 subsidy to buy the Fitbit of his or her choice, with the employee paying the rest of the cost. ####  ##### “Having a little skin in the game ... seems to have an influence,” Mr. Staufacker said. ####  ##### Most employers hire an outside party to collect and manage personal health information generated by the wearable devices, experts say. The information provided to employers does not identify employees. ####  ##### But employers also must be aware of what information the devices collect, who has access to it and how it may be used, said Joseph Lazzarotti, a principal in the Morristown, New Jersey, office of Jackson Lewis P.C. and co-lead of the law firm's privacy, e-communication and data security practice. Without proper program designs and safeguards, employers could inadvertently breach various data protection and nondiscrimination laws, he said. ####  ##### “These (wellness) programs sit at the crossroads of a lot of different laws,” and wearables add another layer of potential risk, he said. ####  ##### Employers may tie biometric data from wearables to incentives in wellness programs, but the programs must comply with new  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rules that limit the incentives employees and spouses receive and ensure data is kept confidential, Mr. Lazzarotti said. ####  ##### Employers “still have to go through the hoops” to ensure that wellness programs comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, he said. ####  ##### Employers should also ask device manufacturers whether they have appropriate protections in place to ensure that the data is secure, he added. Fitbit Inc., for instance, announced last September that its corporate wellness offering complies with privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. ####  ##### Employers and wearable providers have another ongoing challenge: how to sustain employee interest when the novelty of logging daily steps wears off. ####  ##### “People engage with a device, and then they kind of hit a wall because they're not learning anything new,” said Rhett Woods, chief creative officer in the San Francisco office of Rally Health Inc., a digital health firm whose insurer clients run wellness programs for employers. ####  ##### Last September, Target Corp. doled out free and discounted Fitbits to its 335,000 U.S. employees and issued fitness team challenges. It put up $1 million to donate to the winning team's favorite charity as an incentive. ####  ##### Team-based challenges “create a lot more stickiness” because everyone's in it together, said Mr. Woods. “If there's no defined activity around the wearable device, then it's up to everybody to figure out how it fits into their life.” ####  ##### While some employees may be more engaged in minding their health, experts say it's too soon to say whether wearables improve wellness program outcomes. ####  ##### Emory, for one, is looking to future challenges. Under consideration: a $30 Fitbit subsidy for spouses or partners this year. ####  ##### For 2017, it is weighing credits to participants' health savings accounts, health plan deductibles or coinsurance, Mr. Staufacker said. #### "
"Employers look to wellness coaches to create, maintain healthy workforce","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aon Hewitt, Lockton, Health Care Costs"," ##### Employers are changing their views about health and lifestyle coaching as part of a wellness program. ####  ##### “We are seeing more employers step back and saying dollar-for-dollar (return-on-investment) is short-sighted and tough to measure,” said Dr. Ron Leopold, Atlanta-based chief medical officer at Lockton Cos. L.L.C. Companies are looking for “any combination of reduction in medical costs, short-term disability, workers comp claims and improvement in engagement, loyalty, performance (and) employee satisfaction.” ####  ##### About 70% of employers offered a wellness program in 2015, and 46% offered health and lifestyle coaching, according to the Society for Human Resource Management research. Such coaching can be used to help manage chronic diseases, weight- and stress-reduction efforts and smoking-cessation programs. While many employers initially focused on how wellness efforts affected the bottom line, more are focusing on the programs' ability to produce and retain a healthy workforce, experts say. ####  ##### “The reasons are much broader than they used to be; for one employer, it was all about productivity,” said Stephanie Pronk, Minneapolis-based senior vice president and leader of the health transformation team at Aon Hewitt. “With return on investment, (companies) could never get enough people involved to see a real trend.” ####  ##### Today's focus is on “value,” according to experts. ####  ##### For example, Children's Mercy Hospitals & Clinics, a Kansas City, Missouri-based hospital system with 7,800 employees at seven campuses and 10 outreach centers, measures the success of its health-coaching program by gauging the reduction of nine areas of risk, including weight, stress, blood pressure, cholesterol and tobacco use, said Candice Gwin, employee wellness program manager at the health care system. ####  ##### Children's Mercy Hospitals' health coaching efforts in 2015 reduced risks in seven of the nine areas and 16% overall, she said, adding that the reductions have continued. ####  ##### “The monetary aspect is important, but when you take a step back, we know that we can take better care of those kids if we take better care of our employees,” Ms. Gwin said. “We want to do this (for our employees) because it's the right thing to do.” ####  ##### “I think companies still want it to be quantified, but they are looking more at the value of health coaching,” said Kristin Behler, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based manager of health education and wellness at Populytics/BeneFIT Corporate Wellness, which offers wellness services. “Companies that buy into corporate wellness want to be seen as caring for their employees.” ####  ##### Another trend is that companies have shifted their focus from risk identification — such as annual health screenings — to risk reduction, which is where health coaching comes in, said Fiona Gathright, Bethesda, Maryland-based president and CEO of Wellness Corporate Solutions L.L.C. ####  ##### “The focus is on participants' goals and desires for changes,” she said. “Empowering employees to change their behaviors and lower their health risk is where the focus is.” ####  ##### “Health coaching continues to grow, (and) traditional telephonic health coaching is only one mode; we are seeing the use of technology, chat coaching, video coaching and, of course, in-person coaching,” said Ms. Pronk. ####  ##### Programs for every employer budget ####  ##### Companies with more resources tend to adopt more robust programs, with smaller companies turning more often to remote, telephonic and Internet-based programs that cost less but can produce some of the same results, she said. ####  ##### “The cost depends on the type of counseling; it can be minimal or a couple hundred dollars a year for each participant,” Ms. Pronk said. ####  ##### According to a 2015 analysis by Mercer L.L.C., at least 83% of large companies offer disease management coaching; 71% offer telephonic or Internet-based counseling; and 36 % offer face-to-face counseling. ####  ##### Still, Kristin Parker, Mercer's Norwalk, Connecticut-based principal and East market total health management leader, believes face-to-face counseling is on the rise. ####  ##### “There's a resurgence of on-site face-to-face coaching,” Ms. Parker said. “The trend is for employers to have on-site clinics in place and broader well-being centers with coaching available.” ####  ##### David Anderson, St. Paul, Minnesota-based chief health officer and co-founder of The Staywell Co., which provides health coaching services, said employers can still gain traction with more affordable telephone programs. ####  ##### “The downside of (the face-to-face) approach is ... in terms of the relationship and the participant, it takes a bit longer for the person to open up when they are in front of you,” Mr. Anderson said. “Anonymity over the phone allows them to get to you quickly, and the phone (call) is task-oriented.” ####  ##### When health coaching programs fail, anecdotal evidence points to timing as the reason why, Ms. Parker said. ####  ##### “This is when the intervention is not brought to the employee at the right time,” she said. ####  ##### Companies often adhere to strict enrollment periods for health coaching that coincide with health insurance open enrollment. The strategy, Ms. Parker and others said, often fails because a person could be diagnosed with a disease in the middle of the year and need the intervention then. ####  ##### The solution is to offer health coaching programs all year and to “flag” individuals based on health claims, Ms. Parker said. ####  ##### Dr. Leopold said mining health claim data and contacting employees who need intervention — often through a third party and with the employee's consent — is a delicate issue, but also is a hurdle companies can avoid by offering coaching to all employees. ####  ##### “Offer generally and then (send) supplemental information” to targeted individuals, Dr. Leopold said. “The industry is getting more sophisticated.” #### "
"Special trusts help employers shed retiree health care liabilities","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Special trusts called voluntary employees' beneficiary associations, long used to fund long-term disability and other employee benefits, have become a way for financially troubled employers to shed their retiree health care liabilities. ####  ##### VEBAs also are being used by financially healthy organizations. For example, more than 50 colleges and universities have banded together to fund their retiree health care programs (see related story). ####  ##### And in a one-of-a-kind approach, The Coca-Cola Co. has proposed using a VEBA as part of a complex arrangement to fund retiree health care using its South Carolina-domiciled captive insurer. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Labor approved the arrangement in 2010. And this month, the Internal Revenue Service, in a general revenue ruling, gave favorable tax treatment to the approach. ####  ##### Coca-Cola said in a statement it is now studying the ruling “so that we can now move ahead.” ####  ##### VEBAs, first authorized by a 1928 federal law, have been around for decades. But it has been only in recent years — because of the size of the newest trusts — that VEBAs have been in the spotlight. ####  ##### “Until fairly recently, you haven't heard much about VEBAs,” said Michael Thompson, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### But that has changed. ####  ##### “There have been some very large undertakings,” said Dave Ostendorf, a senior consultant with Towers Watson & Co. in Milwaukee. ####  ##### “VEBAs are becoming an attractive retiree health care funding vehicle,” said Tom Tomczyk, a principal in the Pittsburgh office of Buck Consultants L.L.C. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Much of the recent VEBA activity has involved financially troubled employers that were liable for massive retiree health care obligations for union-represented employees and retirees. ####  ##### The largest retiree health care VEBA transaction goes back to 2007, when the three Detroit automakers reached a VEBA deal with the United Auto Workers union in which Chrysler L.L.C., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. agreed to contribute about $50 billion to a VEBA controlled by the UAW. With that, the automakers no longer have to provide health coverage to UAW-represented retirees, their families or future retirees. ####  ##### Also in 2007, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. agreed to pump $1 billion into a VEBA, eliminating its obligation to provide retiree health care benefits as part of a deal struck with the United Steel Workers union. ####  ##### The two are among the largest to date among the more than 1,000 VEBAs that have been formed (see chart). ####  ##### What these and other VEBA retiree health care deals have in common are trade-offs for employers, employees and retirees. ####  ##### For employers, the VEBA approach means relinquishing huge sums of money. For example, the UAW's contract required GM to pump $30 billion into the VEBA — money that could have been used for other corporate purposes. “You are talking about a very substantial cash commitment,” said Towers Watson's Mr. Ostendorf. ####  ##### On the other hand, employers' VEBA contributions, which include assumptions about interest income over time, may be far less than the benefits' value. In GM's case, its $30 billion VEBA contribution was $20 billion less than the $50 billion value of the benefits. ####  ##### Employers that use such approaches are free from the cost and administrative hassle in offering retiree health coverage to what can be huge numbers of retirees and their dependents. The auto industry VEBA, which provides coverage to 766,000 Chrysler, Ford and GM retirees and dependents, has 90 staffers, a UAW spokeswoman said. In 2012, the most recent information available, about $4.1 billion was paid for participants' health services, she said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### How long the money employers contribute to VEBAs will last is an unknown because of the lack of certainty on two key variables: investment returns and health care inflation rates. ####  ##### On the other hand, the VEBA approach assures retirees “that some benefits will be provided where otherwise retirees might have ended up with none,” said Buck Consultants' Mr. Tomczyk. ####  ##### From the retirees' perspective, “It is better to have something funded than not funded,” Mr. Ostendorf said. ####  ##### “The money is secure and dedicated to retirees' benefits. That has helped to bolster the security of the benefits,” Mr. Thompson said. ####  ##### More retiree health care VEBAs may be formed down the road. ####  ##### Mr. Ostendorf said he believes interest could come from the public sector, which has amassed enormous, and largely unfunded, retiree health care obligations. In 2010 — the last year for which complete information is available — states had $627 billion in unfunded retiree health care obligations, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Center on the States, a nonprofit organization in Washington. ####  ##### However, Congress' failure last year to extend a VEBA-related provision that was part of a 2009 law removed a tax break for special retiree health care VEBAs: those authorized by federal bankruptcy courts. ####  ##### Under that provision, VEBA participants were eligible for a federal tax credit equal to 72.5% of the premiums they paid for coverage. That tax credit, though, expired at the end of 2013, and little momentum has developed in Congress to restore it. #### "
"Maine health care captive insurer offers primary coverage to employer group","Benefits Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Health Care Benefits"," ##### The nation's first group health insurance captive, formed as a result of special enabling legislation in Maine, is flourishing while controlling health care costs for its 50 employer members through value-based purchasing and an emphasis on wellness and disease prevention. ####  ##### While numerous group captives have been formed in various U.S. domiciles to provide stop-loss coverage to self-insured employers, the Maine Wellness Association Captive is the first of its kind formed to provide primary health care coverage to employer groups. ####  ##### Unlike a multiple employer welfare arrangement, which is governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Maine Wellness Association Captive is state-regulated. As such, it provides coverage for all state-mandated benefits, but also meets minimum essential benefit requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### “Although we're structured as a captive, we are following all the same guidelines as an insurer,” said Art Batson III, chief financial officers and owner of Falmouth, Maine-based John Lucas Tree Expert Co., one of the initial captive members, and chairman of its board of directors. “We're the only association captive in the country that is doing health. It's like a trust. It's just a different legal instrument. But to join the captive, you have to have Maine operations.” ####  ##### The health care captive was made possible as a result of a 2011 amendment to Maine's captive law that state lawmakers passed at the urging of employers, said Eric Cioppa, the state's superintendent of insurance. ####  ##### “The groups approached the legislature to change the statute,” Mr. Cioppa recalled. “We didn't have a lot of competition in the small-group market.” ####  ##### Because many of the health care captive's founding members had succeeded in lowering their workers compensation costs via self-insurance, they wanted to replicate that success in health care, Mr. Cioppa said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We have one of the biggest self-insured workers compensation markets in the country,” with nearly half of Maine employers self-insuring their occupational exposures via multiemployer trusts, he said. ####  ##### Rather than forming a trust, the employers chose the captive route because it was not governed by ERISA and required lower startup costs, said those involved in the captive's formation. ####  ##### Since its Jan. 1, 2012, inception, the captive has grown to include 50 employer members, which collectively provide health coverage to 4,500 employees and their dependents, said Joe Edwards, a former Maine insurance regulator who was instrumental in getting the captive formed and now serves as its president. ####  ##### Captive executives say they are keeping cost increases at or below market levels. There are no initial capital requirements to join; employers pay a $100 annual membership fee to belong to the wellness association. Then, depending on their size, employers pay premiums for the captive's health insurance program, “MaineSense,” based on their group's claims experience or a community rate based on employee demographics. ####  ##### Employers determine their own plan's benefits and employee premium contributions. The captive picks up claim costs up to $500,000 per individual, with specific stop-loss coverage purchased from Pembroke, Bermuda-based PartnerRe Ltd. covering the rest, Mr. Edwards said. ####  ##### The captive has succeeded in limiting members' rate increases through value-based purchasing via direct contracts with health care providers and by emphasizing wellness and disease prevention, Mr. Edwards said. ####  ##### For example, the captive contracts with an imaging center normally closed on Saturdays to provide mammograms and colonoscopies to plan members at a fraction of what they would cost during the week, he said. ####  ##### “We also are bringing health care to the worksite,” Mr. Edwards said. “We had two guys who hadn't been to the doctor in 30 years. So we brought the doctor to them” by providing biometric screenings and worksite medical care. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We call it Triple Aim,” Mr. Edwards said. “The No. 1 priority is better health for employees. No. 2 is a better health care system. We think if we do those two things, there will be better costs,” the third prong of the plan. ####  ##### So far, the captive is achieving that goal, said Joel Allumbaugh, president of the Hallowell, Maine-based National Worksite Benefit Group, who has been a consultant to the captive since the startup. ####  ##### “It has performed equal to, if not a little bit better than, the market,” he said. Also, “with employer committees active in developing policy and changes to improve the program to suit the wants and needs of its members, it's also delivering a unique and beneficial experience” to captive members and their employees, he said. #### "
"Health care providers enter the insurance arena","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Aon Benfield, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers, Willis Towers Watson"," ##### The lines are blurring between traditional health insurers and providers as more health systems develop their own insurance plans. ####  ##### But, wary of this relatively immature health care delivery model and potential administrative headaches, most employers have been reluctant to choose the option. ####  ##### Health systems are moving into the insurance business from solely providing care through fully owned insurance plans or joint ventures with insurers to help promote high-value care, reduce costs, drive patients to their services and differentiate their revenue streams, observers say. ####  ##### Though the concept isn't new — the 1990s saw an uptick in the creation of provider-sponsored health plans, though many failed — it has seen renewed growth since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### Exchanges spur interest ####  ##### According to an April report by New York-based McKinsey & Co., 106 providers were offering at least one health plan in 2014, up from 94 in 2010, and about 15.3 million people were enrolled in a provider-sponsored health plan in 2014, versus 12.4 million 2010. Most of the growth occurred in government plans such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage and the individual insurance market, where there's opportunity because of the public health exchanges. The small-group market also saw slight growth, McKinsey said. ####  ##### Enrollment in the provider-sponsored health plans in the large group and administrative-services-only markets declined, however, McKinsey said. ####  ##### Most recently, Hartford, Connecticut-based health insurer Aetna Inc. in May announced a joint health plan with Texas Health Resources, a 24-hospital system based in Arlington, Texas. And in late April, a Wisconsin subsidiary of Anthem Inc. joined forces with Milwaukee-based health system Aurora Health Care to create a 50-50 joint venture, Wisconsin Collaborative Insurance Co. ####  ##### “The entire design of this is based on a mutual commitment to build a more sustainable health care system by, in essence, optimizing care delivery,” said Larry Schreiber, New York-based CEO of Wisconsin Collaborative Insurance. “We are acutely aligned on all the important metrics that we need to be holding ourselves accountable to” involving cost structure and clinical pathways, he said. ####  ##### Today's post-health care law environment, with its emphasis on driving value in health care, is ripe for health systems to take on more financial risk by insuring their own patients, observers say. ####  ##### But larger employer groups are a challenging market for provider-sponsored plans. ####  ##### Large employers have been approached, but “we see very few takers,” said Mike Taylor, Boston-based senior vice president with Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### There have been enrollment gains among small employers, as McKinsey noted, but they typically don't need a big national network. ####  ##### It's risky for employers, Mr. Taylor said, because most of the provider-sponsored plans aren't as mature as traditional health insurers. Additionally, it can be an administrative headache for an employer who has a workforce in several states, because provider-sponsored plans typically operate in the state or location where the health system is present, he said. ####  ##### “There's a little bit of a barrier to entry in that they're new, they don't cover enough geography, and I think that's what's sort of holding back employers from going to (them),” he said. ####  ##### Many local health systems don't have the “administrative infrastructure that's required to support an employer directly,” like the ability to coordinate with the employer's pharmacy benefit manager or deal with employees' health savings accounts, said Scott Rabin, Los Angeles-based national practice leader of health exchange solutions with Xerox HR Services. ####  ##### Providers “love this idea” of going direct, Mr. Rabin said, but some are “forgetting that there's a whole bunch of stuff that the health plan is doing for those large employers that are not necessarily about provision of care, but are absolutely essential to running a benefit plan.” ####  ##### Still, a few large, innovative employers are “piloting” deals with provider health plans, because “it could be better quality, better experience and lower cost, which is kind of the gold standard,” said Cameron Congdon, Boston-based North American health and benefits leader, client delivery and sales with Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. ####  ##### “Providers who have their own health plan have some unique and special advantages that most health plans don't have, because they have a local brand, because they know these people, they take care of them, they know where they live, they know their preferences, they know all the social determinants of health ... and as a result, they have some competitive advantages, where they can lower the cost and improve the a quality and make something much more affordable,” said Bill Copeland, Philadelphia-based leader of Deloitte L.L.P.'s U.S. life sciences and health care practice. ####  ##### For the model to be effective, employers evaluating provider-sponsored plans should ensure that the narrow network is “stratified” based on quality and outcomes and not just cutting out the most expensive providers to save costs, Mr. Rabin said. ####  ##### Wisconsin Collaborative Insurance is one of the few provider-sponsored plans focused only on middle-market and large employer groups. In the long term, the company could expand into individual and government plans. ####  ##### “What we're coming to market with is everything that you want from a local provider-sponsored health plan with everything you need from a national carrier,” Mr. Schreiber of Wisconsin Collaborative said. “It puts us in a space that differentiates us not just relative to local provider-owned health plans, but to our national carrier competition.” ####  ##### The joint venture eliminates the geography barrier for multisite employers by combining a local health system in Wisconsin with a national network. ####  ##### Provider-sponsored health plans could play a larger role in employer health plans in the future, experts say. ####  ##### “As these provider-sponsored health plans get bigger and more mature, I think there is likelihood to be more interest, because in general, they can ... price more competitively than some of the big carriers,” Aon Hewitt's Mr. Taylor said. “They can control what they charge for their services.” #### "

Inc. provides one-stop shopping for employees with questions about any of their company benefits. ####  ##### Using a single sign-on for Web-based portal called Powerline, employees can check their 401(k) balances, apply for 401(k) loans, find out how much of their health care deductibles have been met, read articles about ways to take better care of their health or report the need to take time off from work. ####  ##### The portal, launched in 2009, was built by and is administered by Aon Hewitt, fed with data from J.C. Penney's PeopleSoft-powered human resources information system. Powerline connects Aon Hewitt, which administers J.C. Penney's health and welfare and retirement plans; UnitedHealth Group Inc., which administers the company's lifestyle and medical management systems; Express Scripts Inc., J.C. Penney's pharmacy benefit manager; and Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc., which administers the retailer's total absence management program. ####  ##### The portal also has benefit guides that include summary plan descriptions and health plan tools, such as drug cost comparisons and provider directories. Employees use it to enroll in their benefits at open enrollment and to complete their health risk assessments, apply for a 401(k) loan or get their prescriptions filled. There's even a Web chat feature for employees who have simple questions that don't need the level of assistance provided by call center advocates. ####  ##### J.C. Penney employees “go to one place and they are able to access all of the information they need surrounding their benefits,” said Anita Fulton, vice president of benefits at Aon Hewitt based in Lincolnshire, Ill. “We also have the ability to provide links directly into the Sedgwick system so participants can get their case status” if they are on leave or disability. ####  ##### “We're also doing links in the medical space to the carrier website, where they complete their personal health assessment. It's a seamless experience,” she said. ####  ##### In 2012, Powerline was upgraded to provide special “tier 2” assistance to employees who need additional help addressing certain life events, such as a death in the family, applying for retirement benefits or taking a hardship withdrawal from the 401(k) plan. ####  ##### “We can do a warm transfer to a tier 2 call center advocate who will serve as a guide, walking them through their benefits,” Ms. Fulton said. #### "

Penney's consumer-driven health plan. This charge is not subject to health plan deductibles, which range from $750 to $4,000. ####  ##### Walgreen Co. operates the pharmacy, which offers prescription drugs at competitive prices, even though they are subject to the health plan deductibles. ####  ##### The clinic costs J.C. Penney about $1 million annually to operate, but Mr. Harmon estimates the return on investment is between four-to-one and five-to-one, based on medical cost savings and enhanced productivity stemming from the fact that employees don't have to leave the company's headquarters campus for minor medical treatment. ####  ##### Headquarters employees also have access to an on-site fitness center, which provides nutrition counseling, exercise equipment and classes, all in support of employee wellness. #### "
"Technology fosters employee wellness participation, accountability","Benefits Management",""," ##### Incorporating high-tech gadgetry into wellness programs can boost wellness program participation rates and ensure greater accountability among employees, employers and gamification experts are finding. ####  ##### Rick Stull, wellness coordinator for Colorado Springs School District 11, said the school district used the SonicPed, a wireless and waterproof activity-tracking device provided by Carlsbad, Calif.-based Sonic Boom Wellness, as an inducement to encourage employees to participate in biometric health screenings. ####  ##### Sonic Boom rebranded the Pebble tracking device made by Shelton, Conn.-based FitLinxx as the SonicPed, said Danna Korn, Sonic Boom's CEO and co-founder. ####  ##### “It's generated a lot of enthusiasm among our benefits-eligible employees,” Mr. Stull said. “The SonicPed was free'' if you tracked height, weight, waist measurement and basic blood work. ####  ##### In 2012, the first year the Colorado Springs school district offered the SonicPeds, 68% of employees signed up for biometric screenings, Mr. Stull said. ####  ##### Vlad Gyster, CEO and co-founder of H.Engage, a Boston-based startup that uses text messages as part of a wellness gamification strategy, has seen wellness program participation rates increase significantly when technology is used. ####  ##### For example, Michelin North America's health risk assessment completion rates were 26% higher for employees who agreed to accept regular wellness prompts via text messaging, according to a case study published by H.Engage. ####  ##### While offering a free gadget may ensure greater employee engagement, it also can satisfy an ulterior motive: accountability. ####  ##### “I like having a device or something to report into,” said Merry DeMartino, an executive vice president at Event Network Inc. in San Diego. ####  ##### “We tried to do some homemade gamification where you might have some people not be entirely truthful. It can be de-motivating. But you can't trick the pedometer.” ####  ##### The devices also make tracking activity effortless for employees. The Pebble, developed by FitLinxx, downloads steps, calories burned, activity time and distance traveled via a wireless Internet connection. ####  ##### “When you walk into your workplace or home, the device automatically downloads the data into your PC. The user doesn't have to do anything as long as you're within 100 feet” of the FitLinxx USB connector plugged into the computer, said Dave Monahan, FitLinxx's CEO. #### "
"Matthew Harmon named 2013 Benefit Manager of the Year®","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### J.C. Penney Co. Inc.'s aging employee population was taking a toll on its benefits budget, exacerbating the impact that sluggish post-recession sales were having on the retailer's bottom line. ####  ##### If it did nothing, the cost of providing benefits to its employees would double in five years to $400 million. ####  ##### Though the solution seemed obvious to Matthew Harmon, J.C. Penney's benefits delivery and retirement director, it also was a radical idea at the time, especially for a Fortune 500 company. He proposed replacing J.C. Penney's rich, self-funded preferred provider organization health plan that had copays of just $10 with a high-deductible consumer-driven health plan. ####  ##### But that kind of out-of-the-box thinking was just what Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney needed in 2009. ####  ##### So in 2010, J.C. Penney “pulled off the Band-Aid” that had been insulating its employees from the true cost of health care and went full replacement. Although employees could still receive preventive care at no cost, all other health care services would be subject to a deductible of at least $1,150. ####  ##### Employees were challenged further: Complete a health risk assessment and take steps to get healthier or pay $600 more annually for health benefits. ####  ##### As a result, instead of growing by 8% to 12% annually, as in the past, this one-two punch has slashed J.C. Penney's health care costs by 15%, shaving $30 million off its $200 million annual health benefits budget. ####  ##### Though the plan design was modified somewhat in subsequent years, all of J.C. Penney's benefits-eligible full-time employees continue to be enrolled in a consumer driven health plan. And employees are sharing the savings by keeping their contributions flat and spending less on health care as they lose weight, quit smoking and eliminate the health risks that could have led to costly and debilitating illnesses down the road. ####  ##### For this and other accomplishments, Mr. Harmon, 38, has been named Business Insurance's 2013 Benefit Manager of the Year®. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We were not going to get younger overnight, and we weren't going to become completely consumer-driven overnight. So we looked at the continuum and decided to start by helping people understand what health care actually costs — not $10,” said Mr. Harmon. ####  ##### Today, a self-insured CDHP is the only option offered to J.C. Penney's full-time benefits-eligible population of about 40,000. However, there are four different deductible levels, with premiums based on the amount of risk taken. ####  ##### A user-friendly Web-based portal called Powerline is helping to facilitate this education and transition, along with customer service provided by Aon Hewitt, lifestyle and medical management services provided by UnitedHealth Group Inc., and a total absence management program overseen by Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. ####  ##### Besides revamping the company's health benefits, Mr. Harmon also has made a significant impact on other J.C. Penney benefits programs, such as its 401(k) plan, where enrollment and contributions are up after a targeted communications initiative. ####  ##### J.C. Penney awarded Mr. Harmon the Chairman's Award for Excellence in Benefits in 2009 for his efforts. ####  ##### Mr. Harmon “brings his own brand of compassion, out-of-the-box thinking and energy to people and projects, which to me means he recognizes the ""right thing to do' and then goes about making it possible,” said Brynn Evanson, J.C. Penney's executive vice president of human resources, in a letter nominating Mr. Harmon for this year's Benefit Manager of the Year® award. ####  ##### Mr. Harmon also has taken service partnerships to a new level, treating the external vendors as members of his employee benefits team. ####  ##### “What we have with J.C. Penney is special,” said Laura Dunn, J.C. Penney's Aon Hewitt account executive in Chicago. “Matt views Aon Hewitt as part of his team. To do that, we need a transparent and flexible model. I feel when I'm calling Matt, there are no boundaries. That helps when we need to get things done. We have context, and I trust Matt.” ####  ##### J.C. Penney “is in the throes of a major transformation of their business. Matt has done a very good job of keeping the entire team working together throughout that transformation,” said Bradley F. Johnson, executive vice president of disability operations at Sedgwick. ####  ##### BUSINESS: J.C.

It also sells its products through www.jcp.com. ####  ##### • James Cash Penney opened his first retail operation, The Golden Rule store, in 1902 in Kemmerer, Wyo., in partnership with Guy Johnson and Thomas Callahan. This “mother store” still operates today and was designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1978. ####  ##### • By 1912, Mr. Penney had 34 stores in the Rocky Mountain states. In 1913, all stores were consolidated under the J.C. Penney banner. ####  ##### • J.C. Penney’s store in Anchorage, Alaska, partially collapsed and was damaged beyond repair in the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The company rebuilt the store as a shorter building on a larger footprint, accompanied by the city’s first public parking garage, which opened in 1968. #### "
"Consumer-driven health plans reverse J.C. Penney's employee health costs trend","Benefits Management","Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### When most U.S. employers were only dabbling in the consumer-driven health plan concept, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. decided in 2010 to “pull off the Band-Aid.” ####  ##### Although it had offered a CDHP as an option, more than 80% of its employees still were enrolled in a generous, self-funded preferred provider organization plan with copayments as low as $10 for doctor's office visits. ####  ##### But the cost trajectory for the PPO plan was unsustainable for the Plano, Texas-based retailer, which was slow to rebound financially from the Great Recession. ####  ##### “We had a significant issue not unlike any other employer. We were on a trend to double our health care spending over a five-year period,” said Matthew Harmon, benefits delivery and retirement director. ####  ##### Because of J.C. Penney's demographics, “we were seeing significantly higher claims per capita in our population” compared with other retailers, he said. “Medical costs were going up 8% to 12% a year. We also had an older population. The average age of our employees is about 48, and 80% are women.” This compares with the average retail industry age of 34. ####  ##### Since “we were not going to get younger overnight,” Mr. Harmon and his staff, with management support, decided the solution was to teach employees to treat health benefits like other consumer items. ####  ##### “We shop for car insurance; we shop for a multitude of things in our daily lives; and the thing that's arguably the most important, we spend the least amount of time on. ... So we knew that we had to make a major paradigm shift. We needed to get our people to become more engaged and be better consumers of their health care,” Mr. Harmon said. ####  ##### “There's the pull-off-the-Band-Aid approach, which we knew we needed to get to very quickly because health care costs were not shrinking, they were growing; and so the installation of a full consumer-driven approach with the right tools to help people be better consumers was something we felt very strongly about. That was for annual enrollment for the plan year beginning Jan. 1, 2010.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Today, 100% of J.C. Penney's benefits-eligible full-time employees are enrolled in a CDHP with a health reimbursement arrangement administered by UnitedHealth Group Inc. Employees have a choice of four deductible levels — $750, $1,150, $2,500 and $4,000 for single coverage, and double those amounts for family coverage — with premiums reflecting the amount of risk being taken. ####  ##### “We started with $1,150 and $2,500 and then we learned that some people wanted to be able to budget more, so they were happy to pay more in premium for a lower deductible. Others who were young and invincible wanted a higher deductible for a lower premium,” Mr. Harmon said. ####  ##### J.C. Penney contributes $200 to the HRA for employee-only cover, $400 for an employee and one dependent and $600 for family cover. Preventive care is covered 100%. ####  ##### Initial responses from employees were “a mixed bag,” he said. ####  ##### Some responded negatively, others positively. Others didn't realize the switch had even occurred until they used their benefits after the conversion, he said. ####  ##### “It was pretty typical of a consumer-driven switchover, where the first couple of years were pretty tenuous,” Mr. Harmon said. ####  ##### In the first year after the conversion, J.C. Penney saved $30 million, 15% off its previous annual health benefits budget of about $200 million. The rates of increase over the subsequent two years have been relatively flat. It also kept employees' premiums flat. ####  ##### Mr. Harmon attributes much of the success of the CDHP conversion to J.C. Penney's provider partnerships. “When you have something as huge to change as consumer-driven, you can go design something, but if you can't administer it in a way that your team members understand it, then it's no good. If you can't communicate it to them, then it's no good. If you can't service them every day when they call in with questions, it's no good.” ####  ##### UnitedHealth and Aon Hewitt, J.C. Penney's benefit plan administrator, “have been tremendous partners to help us deliver on those strategies in short time frames, and they've come to the table every time with ideas and experiences and book-of-business numbers to help us drive where we're going,” Mr. Harmon said. #### "
"J.C. Penney moves toward total absence management program","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### If J.C. Penney Co. Inc. employees are unable to come to work for any reason — illness, injury, a death in the family — they soon will be able to notify Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. ####  ##### After receiving that notice, either reported to a call center via a toll-free telephone number or online via J.C. Penney's Powerline portal, Sedgwick will mobilize to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to replace that person in the workplace and to help them return to work as soon as possible. ####  ##### Whether that involves filing a workers compensation claim or simply directing them to appropriate medical care for a nonoccupational illness, Sedgwick serves as their total absence manager, regardless of the cause. ####  ##### “We want to build a model where we get to total absence and productivity management,” said Matthew Harmon, J.C. Penney's benefits delivery and retirement director. “It's about managing people's return to work, about making sure they're productive when they are at work and that they get the care they need.” ####  ##### For example, a hairdresser calls in sick at 10 a.m. because seasonal weather has triggered an asthma attack. Sedgwick will contact that person's supervisor to have  someone cover scheduled appointments. Sedgwick also will guide the worker to appropriate medical care to manage the condition and remain productive, said Bradley Johnson, vice president of disability and absence management services at Sedgwick in Memphis, Tenn. ####  ##### “We also are working with J.C. Penney to understand the key drivers of absence so we can better manage incidental absence impacting its operations,” he said. And because of the technology component “there will be a higher level of integration, providing customized solutions so managers and supervisors can see why employees are not at work.” ####  ##### The ultimate objective is to “take the guesswork out of absence, whether it's due to something that happened at the worksite or outside of the worksite,” said Paul Barden, CEO of Pacific Resources Benefits Advisors L.L.C., the Chicago-based broker that worked with Mr. Harmon to find the  provider partner. ####  ##### This innovative program, which has been evolving over the past three years, already is saving J.C. Penney “millions” by reducing the incidence and duration of unscheduled absences, Mr. Barden said. ####  ##### “We are challenging Sedgwick as a vendor to deliver something that is not out there in the marketplace. We benefit from it because we have the best programs possible for our employees. They benefit from it because they develop a model that other employers want. This is a problem that is not unique to us,” said Mr. Harmon. #### "
"Benefit brokers moving from sales to service","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Claims Management, TPA"," ##### COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado — As employers demand more services from benefits brokers, brokers are seeking new ways to deliver value and cost savings. ####  ##### Fortunately for brokers, the evolving benefits landscape has offered several opportunities to transform their business models from transactional insurance middlemen to one-stop-shops for benefits and human resources. ####  ##### “There's a transition from brokers really being focused strictly on the employee benefits arena and everything around helping employers secure benefit rates and best plan designs for employees, and it's getting much more into everything around supporting the human resources team,” said Adam Bruckman, president and CEO of Digital Insurance Inc. in Atlanta. ####  ##### The shift, which has been in the works for several years, is partially driven by the health care reform law's complexity, which has left employers in need of broker support for compliance and regulatory issues. Rising health care costs have prompted many employers to shift to high-deductible health plans, which demand more communication with workers and a menu of voluntary benefit options for brokers to help assess. ####  ##### Techcentric benefits startups that combine benefits brokering with HR capabilities have driven employers to think of brokers as consultants and providers of anything benefits and HR managers could need, including payroll, absence management, onboarding, wellness and benefits design, several brokers said during interviews at the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers May 31-June 3 Employee Benefits Leadership Forum in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ####  ##### Employers in the past “may have looked at a technology company for this, and a HR outsource company for this, and a broker for negotiating rates. Now there's a convergence of all those things,” under the brokerage umbrella, Mr. Bruckman said. ####  ##### That means brokers “are really trying to expand their full capabilities, not just their ability to negotiate rates and plan design,” he said. “It's a lot of hard work because you have to train producers on these new solutions, and you have to address all these employer needs.” ####  ##### Digital Insurance, for example, has hired specialists in everything from technology to wellness to meet employers' needs. ####  ##### Brokers have evolved from advisers to “a very, very heavy service mode. It's a business partner mode,” said Kent Crawford, Newport Beach, California-based managing principal at Integro Insurance Brokers. ####  ##### Employers expect brokers to devise benefits strategies as well as execute them, he said. As benefits have become more complex and employers introduce high-deductible health plans to save costs, communicating those changes has become a major broker role. ####  ##### “You are introducing plan designs that are requiring that employee to be much more engaged in the process” of selecting and using the benefit plan, Mr. Crawford said. “That discussion is becoming more complex on a day-to-day basis.” ####  ##### “The broker, as we strive to be relevant to our clients, has moved from just being a product expert and delivering a quality product ... (to) you being the product yourself,” said Jim O'Connor, Manasquan, New Jersey-based president of employee benefits at CBIZ Inc., which has its own platform that integrates benefits consulting and human resources processes. ####  ##### Brokers are acting as benefits administrators, compliance advisers, communication experts and sometimes even outsourced HR departments, he said. ####  ##### Importantly, brokers have also taken a leading role in helping employers to “bend” the health care cost trend, Mr. O'Connor said. ####  ##### “This is where the broker has to evolve his or her knowledge (to) be an expert in the provider side of the equation: What's going on in the world of doctors and hospitals and how are they changing in the equation of benefits?” he said, pointing to accountable care organizations and high-performance physician networks. ####  ##### Because spending on all health plan types and prescription drugs has risen steadily, cost savings won't come from “shopping for better rates and finding a network that has a huge difference in the amount of provider discounts they provide,” said Dan Gowen, Chicago-based senior vice president and national employee benefits practice leader with Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA Inc. ####  ##### Instead, brokers “need to be making sure that we're spending a lot of time with our clients, understanding the risks in their population, how to keep the healthy (people) healthy, and how to try to keep those that are in the chronic condition stages from moving into more acute types conditions. The more that you can balance that out the better you are going to be from a total cost perspective on a year-over-year basis.” ####  ##### “We are spending a tremendous amount of time on transparency and cost control, especially around pharmacy strategies, given the explosion in cost relative to pharmacy and specialty drugs,” said Mike Barone, San Diego-based president of employee benefits at Hub International Ltd. “Brokers who have an ability to understand the space and propose strategies to their clients to reduce cost and improve outcomes are going to have a unique competitive advantage relative to those who don't.” ####  ##### While brokers' roles have expanded, their commissions haven't. ####  ##### “You are working with potentially the same dollar, but you've got more that you are trying to do to meet the needs of our clients,” Digital's Mr. Bruckman said. ####  ##### Part of the reason commissions haven't grown is health care costs make it difficult for employers to spend their money elsewhere, said Jennifer Walsh, San Francisco-based senior vice president and national employee benefits business leader at Woodruff-Sawyer & Co. ####  ##### Competition also is keeping commissions down. “I have more competitors today than I had five years ago,” she said. ####  ##### On the plus side, some sources said they are making more money in fees. ####  ##### “We're seeing some movement away from commissions and into fees,” said Mr. Barone. “What we're seeing in the marketplace are several larger consulting firms take their commissions down a little bit, but build them up significantly on the technology side and benefits administration side.” ####  ##### “So in aggregate, especially when larger and mid-market clients are buying technology, they're actually paying a lot more than they ever have,” Mr. Barone said. #### "
"Small-town guy makes leap to huge job","Benefits Management","Benefits Management"," ##### Life has carried Marty Webb, vice president of benefits at AT&T Inc., a long way from a small Missouri town to the Dallas skyscraper where he now works. ####  ##### Mr. Webb, 57, grew up in Jasper, Missouri, a farming community with a population of less than 1,000. ####  ##### “My dad was a third-generation hardware store owner” and “it was clear that there was no future in that business,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### Mr. Webb also was not satisfied with the idea of only a high school education. ####  ##### “I always wanted to go to college, even as a youngster, and (my parents) knew that. So no, I was never really pushed into the business at all. In fact, I think they knew I wanted to do something different, so they were always very encouraging. ####  ##### “I went to college at Missouri State University in Springfield. I thought I wanted to be a lawyer, but didn't have any money, so I thought I would get a job,” said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### College led directly to the telecommunications industry. ####  ##### “My first job was at Southwestern Bell (Telephone Co.), and I was actually a computer programmer for a while, so I thought I'd stay awhile, and decided one day that rather than go down the legal path, I'd go down the business path,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### That led to an MBA at St. Louis University and, in turn, to greater opportunities at Southwestern Bell, with Mr. Webb working in areas including billing, investor relations and strategic planning. ####  ##### “One day I was asked if I would go over to the benefits organization. That was not something that I had necessarily aspired to, but there were great opportunities. At that point in time, we had gone through a number of mergers and we were getting larger as a company,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Webb and his wife, Denise, have three children. One son works as a retail store manager for AT&T, while a daughter just graduated from college and another son is still in college. ####  ##### “I'm pretty much a family guy,” he said. “I just like spending time with my wife and kids when I can.” #### "
"Retirement savings matter for all employees","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### AT&T Inc.'s Your Money Matters program helps pave the way for its workers' retirement, according to Marty Webb, vice president of benefits in Dallas. ####  ##### Both Your Money Matters and Your Health Matters are part of the You Matter program, with Your Money Matters primarily focused on pensions and savings, said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### “In fact, pensions is one of the areas we feel we've made some great strides in,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Webb also noted that employees' 401(k) accounts are often their greatest source of wealth and what they think about when preparing for their retirement years. ####  ##### “We feel we have an obligation to help people prepare for that as best they can,” including its health and financial aspects, “and so we do what we can to educate employees to participate fully in their 401(k),” said Mr. Webb. “We are close to 90% of our employees who are actively participating in their 401(k),” he said. ####  ##### Similar to its approach on health issues, “we also send out a lot of education on Your Money Matters, and we do seminars that focus on anything from investing to budgeting to meeting (workers') retirement needs,” said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### “And we've even done a couple of things that focus on specific sectors of employees,” he said. The most recent was a video on Generation X employees, he said. ####  ##### AT&T has also held a seminar looking at women's investments, he said. And one still in the planning stages will focus on people who are nearing their retirement years. ####  ##### AT&T seminars are filmed and then made available on the Web, he said. They can have attendance ranging from 50 to 100 people “and we'll speak directly to them, but we'll also broadcast it at the same time so anybody can participate and look at the presentations, and they can ask questions over the Web also,” Mr. Webb said, adding that thousands of people will sometimes participate. #### "
"A healthy outlook for AT&T employees","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits"," ##### AT&T Inc. is one of the largest companies in the world, but Marty Webb is giving it a small-company flavor. ####  ##### Acting on his strongly held belief that he and the company need to do well by AT&T's workers, the vice president of benefits tries to make each worker feel that the telecommunications giant cares about them personally. This philosophy has led to robust 401(k) programs and the transfer of some 200,000 Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents into Aon P.L.C.'s private health insurance exchange. ####  ##### A centerpiece of Mr. Webb's efforts, earning him a spot on the 2015 Business Insurance Benefits Management Honor Roll®, is AT&T's health care program. ####  ##### “We're a hard-working company focused on developing the right products and services and doing so in an environment where lots of changes are occurring because technology is changing dramatically,” he said. ####  ##### “We're nothing without our people and we need them to be healthy, we need to provide tools for them to be trained” on healthy practices, he said of AT&T's more than 240,000 current employees. “It's a people-based business, and if we don't provide the right structure, the right sense of care for our people and the right benefits for our people, then we just won't be successful.” ####  ##### As the company has grown, so have the number of workers and retirees receiving benefits. ####  ##### “Today, we offer health care benefits to over 1 million people; so when you think about it, we offer health care to about to one out of every 300 people within the United States,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### That presents “all types of different opportunities” to offer programs to employees and retirees “and do it in the right fashion, where it's a robust benefit to the people, where it's appropriate for their lifestyles at a cost that makes sense to AT&T,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### The result was the 2012 launch of Your Health Matters, which is “a brand we developed to encompass all of our health care benefits,” including the “tools and resources to lead happier lives,” Mr. Webb said. This program goes beyond traditional medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, disability and life insurance to focus on wellness “and to the extent (employees) have any sort of a chronic problem, a disease management program,” he said. ####  ##### Your Health Matters is backed by a broad communications program that includes incentives for and video vignettes about employees “who have done something ... to lead healthier or happier lives,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### For example, employees can choose a goal that will help them live healthily, such as exercising four times each week, limiting fast food to once a week or quitting smoking. ####  ##### “We do a lot of messaging on this,” he said. Four reminders are sent out about the program during the year. Employees also are asked several questions about their progress to help develop their story. ####  ##### “It even includes changes in our cafeterias, to provide (employees) with healthier options,” he said. ####  ##### The program has entered its second phase, which again includes the Chairman's Challenge in which AT&T Chairman Randall L. Stephenson “asks people to go on their own journey, to set some goals to lead healthier lives.” ####  ##### Mr. Stephenson also participates in Your Health Matters. ####  ##### About 24,000 people are participating in the second phase. When it's complete, employees will select the Chairman's Choice winners, who are given funds to contribute to a charity of their choice, said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### Three people will get $5,000 apiece and three winning groups will receive $10,000 each to donate to a charity, he said. ####  ##### As part of the program, AT&T is using an application that allows people to synchronize with personal devices such as Fitbits to track their weight, sleep patterns, medication or stress management, he said. ####  ##### “It can be whatever they're trying to change in their life to lead a healthier life,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### Participants electronically track their progress throughout the challenge. ####  ##### Mr. Webb said he also participates in the program with a group of fellow benefit employees. His goal is “to lose the nagging 10 pounds” he has been dragging around. “I'm about halfway there,” he said with a chuckle. #### "
"Health care reform COBRA rules bridge public exchange coverage gap","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Recent federal guidance allows employees who lose their group health coverage when they leave or lose their job to get health insurance through public exchanges sooner and with no gaps in coverage by temporarily enrolling in COBRA. ####  ##### The COBRA guidance, included in 436 pages of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act regulations issued last month by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, addresses the health care reform law's requirement that those enrolled in COBRA wait until the next open enrollment period to move to coverage through a public health insurance exchange. ####  ##### The wait can be costly because COBRA enrollees typically pay the full group premium to continue coverage through former employers. In 2013, for example, the average annual premium for employer plans was $5,884, or about $490 per month, for individual coverage and more than $16,300, or about $1,350 a month, for family coverage, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. ####  ##### Coverage through a public exchange, though, can be substantially less. ####  ##### According to an HHS report last week, enrollees in 36 states in which the federal government operates exchanges paid an average of $82 a month for coverage due to federal premium subsidies for lower income individuals. Without the subsidies, the enrollees would have paid $346 a month. ####  ##### Exchange coverage “can be a much better deal” than COBRA, said Elizabeth Vollmar, vice president and co-director of compliance services at Lockton Cos. L.L.C. in St. Louis. ####  ##### But individuals can't get exchange coverage right away. Federal rules say for people who lose employment-based coverage, public exchange coverage cannot begin until the first day of the month following enrollment — resulting in a coverage gap, which the HHS guidance eliminates. ####  ##### Under the regulations, individuals who lose employment-based coverage could opt for COBRA and, within 60 days, enroll in a public exchange plan. Once the exchange plan goes into effect, HHS said the individual could end COBRA coverage. ####  ##### An example, provided by Buck Consultants L.L.C., illustrates how this interplay can work: ####  ##### An employee loses group coverage on Aug. 1. On Sept. 10, he or she enrolls in an exchange plan, with coverage to start on Oct. 1. On Sept 10, he or she also opts for COBRA, with coverage retroactive to Aug. 1. Retroactive coverage is permitted under COBRA. Then on Sept. 30, the individual drops COBRA, with the exchange coverage starting Oct. 1 and avoiding a gap. ####  ##### “This gives individuals an additional window for coverage,” said Rich Stover, a Buck Consultants principal in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### The approach also could be appealing to those who already have met their health plan deductibles for the year, or want to ensure they can stay with their current doctor. Those individuals could keep their COBRA coverage for a limited period and then move over to an exchange plan. ####  ##### Meanwhile, the availability of the federal premium subsidies for exchange coverage could lead to curtailment of a plan design in which employers, as part of a severance package, pay COBRA premiums for several months for employees they let go. ####  ##### Instead, Andy Anderson, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius L.L.P. in Chicago, said an employer would give those individuals a cash lump sum, which could be used to pay for COBRA or exchange premiums. ####  ##### That approach could be cost-effective for employers if the individuals opt for exchange plans, since COBRA beneficiaries tend to be heavier users of health care services than other individuals. A rough rule of thumb, consultants say, is that for every dollar COBRA enrollees pay in premiums, they incur $1.50 in health care costs. ####  ##### “This deals with the adverse selection issue,” Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### While some experts had said public exchanges under the health care reform law would lead to the end of COBRA coverage, that view is fading. ####  ##### “COBRA will continue to be a health coverage alternative,” said Bruce Richards, individual insurance exchange leader at Mercer L.L.C. in Richmond, Virginia, noting, for example, that exchange premium subsidies are available only to those with incomes of up to 400% of the federal poverty level. ####  ##### “COBRA will not disappear,” Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### “The rumors of COBRA's demise are somewhat overstated. It still will have a role in filling gaps in coverage,” said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. #### "
"Self-funding health care program cuts costs for Palm Beach County school district","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### While prevention and detection through a sweeping wellness program are at the core of the School District of Palm Beach County's efforts to keep health care costs under control, a variety of other actions also has been pivotal, says Dianne L. Howard, the West Palm Beach, Florida-based school district's director of risk and benefits management. ####  ##### One of the first cost-saving steps Ms. Howard took was to move the school district to a self-funded health care benefits program in 2007. ####  ##### Two big reasons — both financial — drove the decision to self-fund. ####  ##### “We decided to self-fund when we realized the profits the insurer was making every year,” Ms. Howard said. “Insurers build in a risk corridor, since they are taking the risk if our claims exceed what they expect. It's probably at least 5% of the premium.” ####  ##### In addition, by self-funding, the school district does not have to pay the premium tax the state of Florida imposes on health insurers, a cost insurers typically pass on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums. ####  ##### Ms. Howard estimates that by self-funding — reaping the risk corridor profits and an exemption from insurance premium taxes — the school district saves about $10 million a year. In addition, the school district gets “more detailed reporting, since the data is ours,” she said. ####  ##### Networking led to another way for Ms. Howard to reap millions of dollars a year in savings for the school district's prescription drug benefits program. ####  ##### Through her membership in the Orlando, Florida-based Florida Health Care Coalition, an organization whose employer members have about 2 million enrollees in their health care plans, Ms. Howard became aware of prescription drug rebates. ####  ##### Under such arrangements, prescription drug manufacturers give rebates to insurers in exchange for positioning their drugs on lower copayment coverage tiers that cost less for plan enrollees, resulting in the sale of more of that drugmaker's prescriptions. ####  ##### After learning of the rebates, Ms. Howard approached UnitedHealthcare, the administrator of the school district's prescription drug program, and asked it to forward the rebates to the school district. UnitedHealthcare made a counteroffer: It would discount the administrative fees it charged the school district for running the prescription drug benefits program. ####  ##### The offer was significant: UnitedHealthcare said it would cut its administrative fee by $5 per employee per month, for a total savings of $1.2 million. ####  ##### But Ms. Howard declined. “I said I don't want the $5 discount because I wouldn't get the data or even know what the rebates actually were. I said we would take 80% of the rebates.” ####  ##### UnitedHealthcare advised there was a “cash-flow concern” involving the rebates. The insurer told Ms. Howard that the drug manufacturers didn't immediately distribute rebates and, as a result, the school district could have to wait as long as nine months after a plan year began before the rebates would start to roll in if it wanted a share of them. ####  ##### Ms. Howard didn't find that argument persuasive: “Cash flow was not a problem for us. So receiving rebates would work for us.” ####  ##### Ultimately, UnitedHealth agreed to pass on 80% of the rebates it received from the drug manufacturers, later increasing it to 100%, saving the school district about $5 million per year. ####  ##### “They valued our business,” Ms. Howard said. “Our challenge is to stay ahead of where the money is hidden” in the health care system. ####  ##### In other cases, digging through claims data resulted in significant cost savings. For example, in 2012, the school district began to impose deductibles and coinsurance requirements for diagnostic treatment and magnetic resonance imaging. ####  ##### Digging through claims data, Ms. Howard saw that deductible and coinsurance had not been applied to the MRI claims. “That didn't make sense,” she recalled. ####  ##### A months-long investigation by UnitedHealthcare revealed that claims had not been properly adjudicated. “We were self-funded, so it was our dollars” that were incorrectly being spent, Ms. Howard said. ####  ##### In the end, the appropriate cost-sharing requirements were administered, and the school district recouped $4 million in claims that plan participants, not the school district, were responsible for paying. ####  ##### Other sources of savings have been periodic audits of health care coverage eligibility. At one time, about 1,000 people who were no longer eligible — such as employees' adult children who, because of their age, were not eligible to remain on their parents' coverage or employees who had terminated employment — still had claims being paid. ####  ##### “We started chipping away at the problem,” Ms. Howard said. Ultimately, enrollment audits saved the school district $4.4 million by detecting those no longer eligible for coverage, she said. #### "
"Zurich uses pension de-risking strategy to cut costs and maintain benefits","Benefits Management","Retirement Benefits, Zurich"," ##### A pension de-risking strategy that included offering a temporary lump-sum payment window in 2012 to a select group of terminated vested participants resulted in a significant one-time reduction in pension expenses and an ongoing reduction in administrative costs for Zurich North America. ####  ##### And a change to a more conservative investment mix in response to an asset liability study following the recent economic downturn will further help to protect the assets of the company's defined benefit pension plan going forward, according to Zurich North America Benefits Consultant Lisa Anderson. ####  ##### Over the next few years, the target allocation of Zurich North America's pension fund assets will gradually transition from 55% equities and 45% bonds to 30% equities and 70% bonds, according to Sarah Staggs, head of benefits for the Schaumburg, Illinois-based North American unit of Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., who added that she and her team are continuing to explore other de-risking opportunities. ####  ##### “Unfunded pension liabilities do affect what an insurance company can do with its capital expenditures,” she said. ####  ##### But Zurich North America has no intention of terminating its cash balance plan, because the company's leadership views it as a competitive necessity since approximately 60% of large property/casualty insurers continue to offer defined benefit pension plans, according to Ms. Staggs. ####  ##### Still, with a large number of terminated vested employees still among its plan participants, many of whom had fairly small balances in the plan, it made sense to offer lump-sum distributions to reduce the amount Zurich North America was paying in premiums to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., she said. ####  ##### Of the 6,324 terminated vested plan participants eligible for the special lump-sum distribution, 2,415, or 38.19%, accepted the offer. This resulted in a 19% reduction in PBGC premiums, a 12% reduction in administrative costs, and a 9.2% reduction in the company's pension obligations, Ms. Staggs said. ####  ##### “The goal around de-risking was containing costs and maintaining benefits,” Ms. Staggs explained. “And with the costs around pension administration, paying PBGC premiums and costs of searching people down, there's this question: Does someone who worked here 30 years ago still have a vested interest in Zurich, and do we have a vested interest in them? We wanted to make sure that this was seen as spending benefits dollars wisely.” #### "
"Zurich's Sarah Staggs named to 2014 Benefit Management Honor Roll®","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Zurich"," ##### Using a strategic yet humanitarian approach to addressing benefits challenges, Sarah Staggs, head of benefits for Zurich North America, has slowed the rate of health care spending at the property/casualty insurer from an annual rate of 20% at the beginning of the decade to just 4% in each of the past four years. ####  ##### Ms. Staggs also has led a pension risk-reduction strategy that included changes in investments and offering a temporary lump-sum window to a select group of terminated, vested plan participants, resulting in a significant one-time reduction in Zurich's pension liabilities and long-term savings in administrative costs. ####  ##### For her employee benefits achievements, Ms. Staggs has earned a place on Business Insurance's 2014 Benefit Management Honor Roll®. ####  ##### By fostering a grassroots wellness campaign led by volunteer “wellness champions,” Ms. Staggs also has enabled Schaumberg, Illinois-based Zurich North America, a unit of Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., to be named one of the nation's Best Employers for Healthy Lifestyles by the Washington-based National Business Group on Health for two consecutive years. ####  ##### And to help Zurich North America employees achieve financial wellness, Ms. Staggs instituted automatic enrollment in the company's 401(k) plan starting with a 6% payroll contribution so employees could maximize the company's matching contribution of 6%. ####  ##### She also helps employees maximize their retirement savings by trimming administrative costs for the company's 401(k) plan participants through unbundling and reallocating fees, which enabled their investments to transition to the lowest-cost share classes available from their plan administrator, The Vanguard Group Inc. ####  ##### “When we define what we do as a company, Zurich's mission is to help our customers understand and protect themselves from risk. And you only have to change one word in that to describe what I feel like our department's mission is: To help our employees understand and protect themselves from risks,” said Ms. Staggs. “Those risks can be health care risks; they can be financial risks; they can be lifestyle risks.” ####  ##### After identifying the risks facing Zurich North America employees, as well as the organization that keeps them employed, Ms. Staggs developed and implemented a multiyear strategy that continues to evolve as conditions and laws change, such as the passage the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010. ####  ##### “Sarah was talking about this change a long time ago, before health care reform was enacted,” said Brian Little, head of human resources for Zurich North America and Ms. Staggs' supervisor. “With Sarah's strategic approach to plan design, we will be able to stay on course without being subject to the Cadillac tax and still be able to have robust benefits,” he said, referring to the excise tax on benefits that exceed a certain threshold beginning in 2018. ####  ##### “Like most companies, you have to sell leadership on the cost benefit for what you're doing, and Sarah's very good on the mathematical end of the equation — helping people understand that if you spend money, you're going to get a return on your investment,” Mr. Little said. “But sometimes the return isn't immediate; it's not next quarter. It may be next year or a couple of years after that. So understanding trends is really important, as is being able to translate that into strategic actions over a longer period of time. Sarah's very good at taking the data that comes out of the various firms that we work with and translating that into opportunities for us to think about.” ####  ##### “Sarah is always thinking ahead and about potential downstream effects,” agreed Kristin Bajorat, benefits consultant at Zurich North America and a member of Ms. Stagg's team responsible for health and welfare benefits. “Sometimes you go to seminars where they ask how many companies actually have a strategic plan. We're one of the companies that actually has one.” ####  ##### Ms. Staggs also seeks input from the team she has assembled since joining Zurich North America in 2002, all of whom are subject-matter experts in their own right. ####  ##### “It's definitely a collaborative partnership. That's what makes Sarah a good leader. She listens to what we have to say and asks us to share our ideas,” Ms. Bajorat said. ####  ##### Trained as a teacher, Ms. Staggs also encourages members of her benefits team to pursue continuing education and attend benefits management conferences, where they can gain knowledge to help Zurich North America foster its culture of health and wealth. The company's business strategy is “to deliver sustainable, profitable growth” while remaining committed to shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which they live and work. ####  ##### “I've been in benefits for a long, long time, but I'm still learning from her,” said Lisa Anderson, the benefits consultant responsible for Zurich North America's defined benefit pension plan. “I'm just so proud of us as a team.” ####  ##### Ms. Staggs also “is very empathetic when it comes to work/life balance, which for me is critical,” said Dawn Carthan, the benefits consultant responsible for Zurich North America's 401(k) plan administration and the mother of a special-needs child. ####  ##### “Because we're a large company, even small changes in cost potentially impact revenue,” Mr. Little noted. “At the same time, it's not simply about how much it costs. It's about how you spend your dollars and what kind of value you get from that, because you really want to have competitive benefits. If you don't, then you won't have the talent that you need to be successful as an organization. So even though costs are really important, it's not the only decision-making factor we use. It's more about for every dollar we spend, what do we get in return?” ####  ##### “In her leadership role, Sarah is responsible for implementing a strategy focused on driving change and meeting the needs of Zurich's employees. This strategy has empowered employees to become better health care consumers by providing them with consumer-centric tools coupled with the appropriate financial incentives. The results of this work are evidenced through the marked reduction in the number of employees displaying high health risks and the market-competitive medical benefits program that has operated at an average cost 15% below industry benchmarks for the past four years,” said Scott Ziemba, health and group benefits consultant at Towers Watson in Chicago who has worked closely with Ms. Staggs in developing and implementing Zurich's strategy. #### "
"Zurich's head of benefits lowers costs by implementing consumer-driven plans","Benefits Management","Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits, Zurich"," ##### Sarah Staggs, head of benefits at Zurich North America, implemented a multiyear consumer-driven strategy to put the brakes on the insurer's health care spending, which had been careening out  of control with annual increases of more than 20%. ####  ##### By gradually reducing health care plan offerings to just three levels of consumer-driven health plans administered by a single insurer, and by emphasizing consumerism and wellness, Ms. Staggs has whittled those annual increases down to an average of just 4% over the past four years for the Schaumburg, Illinois-based North American unit of Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. ####  ##### “When we first looked at introducing consumer-driven health plans in 2002, we were experiencing 20% to 21% annual increases in medical costs when the rest of the world was probably more like 10% or 11% and moving down. But we weren't moving down, so we realized there was something we had to do relatively quickly,” Ms. Staggs recalled. ####  ##### “I think we were experiencing part of the problems of what was happening in some of the smaller companies, trying to unify them into a larger program,” she said. “We had just merged five companies together to form Zurich North America and had a combination of different health plans and providers.” ####  ##### “We also realized we needed to move to the concept of ""Your health care doesn't cost that $20 copay. Your doctor's visit cost the company the other $80 you didn't have  to pay.' And we need to make sure that people are getting the right care at the right time in the right place. People were using emergency rooms for basic health care when a doctor's office visit could handle it,” Ms. Staggs said. ####  ##### Ms. Staggs' first step was to consolidate health plans, which enabled her to negotiate a better deal with one health plan vendor: United Healthcare. ####  ##### “We gained some efficiencies there. It made our job of communicating internally easier. We weren't spending so much time explaining the difference between three different vendors. We were explaining what does the plan cover, how should you use it, and here are the tools that can help you make the best decision for you to meet your health care needs,” she said. ####  ##### Her next steps were to introduce a CDHP with a health savings account as an option in 2005, and then to gradually eliminate the plans with lower deductibles, adding two other options with even higher deductibles, all with HSAs. Today, Zurich North America offers just three CDHPs: Choice Plus HSA, with a $1,250 single/$2,500 family deductible; Choice Max HSA, with a $2,000 single/$4,000 family deductible; and Choice Premier HSA, with a $2,800/$5,600 deductible, Ms. Staggs said. ####  ##### Zurich North America also contributes $500 to HSAs for single coverage if an employee contributes at least $100 of their own money, and $1,000 for HSAs linked to family coverage if an employee contributes at least $200. The funds are deposited annually on Jan. 1 so that employees who need to pay for health care expenses within their deductibles early in the year have access to them. ####  ##### Since the middle-level CDHP has become the most popular benefits option, with 44% of Zurich North America's benefits-eligible employees enrolled, and with the average HSA account balance at the end of 2013 being $3,396, the consumerism strategy appears to be working, according to Ms. Staggs. ####  ##### “We have done a lot on the design side with going to full-replacement high-deductible health plans to push the button as far as we can on design, realizing that we've actually reaped some benefits as a company for that because our per capita spend is lower than the national average,” Ms. Staggs said. “Part of the benefit of that is employees are responsible for a little bit more of the first dollar, but we look at it also that people have become better consumers. They ask more questions.” #### "

"Employers rethink benefits after gay marriage ruling","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide figures to affect employers' benefit strategies for years to come. ####  ##### For many employers, the June 26 ruling in James Obergefell et al. v. Richard Hodges et al., which invalidated state laws denying marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, will reduce the administrative burden of providing health and retirement benefits to employees' same-sex spouses. ####  ##### Additionally, experts said, the decision may compel employers offering spousal-equivalent benefits to same-sex domestic partners to eliminate that coverage now that full marriage rights are available in all states. ####  ##### “It's truly a landmark decision from both the social and benefits perspectives, and I think it's going to have a dramatic impact on employers and how they approach their benefit plans going forward,” said Scott Cooper, a Philadelphia-based partner at law firm Blank Rome L.L.P. ####  ##### As a result of Obergefell, employers that fully insure their group health care plans must offer married same-sex couples the same coverage as opposite-sex couples. ####  ##### About 39% of U.S. employees were covered under fully insured health plans at the end of 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. ####  ##### Employers that self-insure their health plans can elect not to cover employees' same-sex spouses even if they cover married opposite-sex couples. ####  ##### However, experts said, such a strategy could be legally perilous, particularly in light of Obergefell as well as the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in U.S. v. Edith Windsor et al., which recognized same-sex marriages under federal law. ####  ##### “The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has taken the position that sexual-orientation discrimination can constitute sex discrimination under Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act), so employers that continue to exclude same-sex spouses need to be mindful of the legal risk,” said Todd Solomon, a Chicago-based partner at McDermott Will & Emery L.L.P. ####  ##### For most employers that offer equal spousal benefits to married couples regardless of sexual orientation, last month's ruling eliminates the need to impute taxes separately for benefits provided to same-sex couples in states that did not recognize their marriage. ####  ##### “The advice we'll be giving to all of our clients is to very quickly figure out what they need to do and then communicate that out to their employees,” Mr. Cooper said. “There's a lot of explaining that's likely going to need to be done.” ####  ##### With marriage rights now available to gay and lesbian couples in all 50 states, experts say employer-sponsored health coverage for same-sex domestic partners — offered by 46% of large and midsize companies before the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling — could decrease in future years. ####  ##### “The question for a lot of employers is going to be what kind of transition period they're looking at for phasing out domestic partner benefits,” said Steven Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the Washington-based National Business Group on Health. “You want to make sure that if you're going to phase out those benefits, you do it gradually and with significant communication, so your employees have time to plan and adjust.” ####  ##### A key factor in many employers' decisions could be the extent to which they already cover opposite-sex domestic partners. ####  ##### “If the employer also covers opposite-sex unmarried partners, it is unlikely to eliminate any coverage because it already covers a set of unmarried employees who have had the ability to marry,” Mr. Solomon said. “On the other hand, if the employer covers only same-sex unmarried partners, it might deem it most fair to require those employees to marry in order to retain their benefits.” ####  ##### While eliminating domestic partner coverage might be a sound financial and administrative strategy, experts say employers should weigh the decision carefully, particularly given the lack of employment discrimination protections for gay and lesbian workers at the federal level and in 28 states. ####  ##### If same-sex couples identify themselves by getting married and seeking spousal benefits, they could be exposed to workplace bias based on their sexual orientation, experts said. ####  ##### “That's one of the issues that's going to have to play out over the coming weeks, months and perhaps even years,” Mr. Cooper said. “It's important to look at what the Supreme Court's decision was and what it was not, and what the ruling did not necessarily answer are questions regarding outright employment discrimination.” ####  ##### Other questions include at what point state-level coverage requirements will take effect and whether employers will allow retroactive spousal coverage. ####  ##### “I suspect that the timing and mechanics of the various state regulators rolling out those pieces of guidance will follow very closely to what we saw after Windsor,” where the first IRS guidance was issued about two months later, said Beth Alcalde, a managing partner at Akerman L.L.P. in West Palm Beach, Florida. “It might even come faster than it did after the Windsor decision, simply because it has been done before at the federal level and in certain states.” ####  ##### Also unclear is the potential for conflicts between the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell and its June 2014 ruling in Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. et al. v. Sylvia Burwell, which exempted closely held, religiously inclined employers from having to provide employees with cost-free contraceptive coverage. ####  ##### “What happens if you've got an employer that claims a religious objection to same-sex marriage?” asked Susan Hoffman, a Philadelphia-based shareholder at law firm Littler Mendelson P.C. “Without federal protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation, the question becomes whether a closely held employer with those objections can legally discriminate against same-sex couples.” #### "
"Redefining the value of wellness","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Employers have long used return on investment to demonstrate how much a dollar spent on workplace wellness saves on medical costs, but the results often are disappointing because ROI fails to capture the broader effect of employee health interventions on the overall business. ####  ##### That's why some companies are looking, instead, to measure value on investment, which assesses how an employer's wellness strategy affects business goals, such as improving employee health, safety, productivity and engagement. ####  ##### “We need to step back and look at the whole enchilada,” said Ron Leopold, Atlanta-based national practice leader of health outcomes at Willis North America Inc., on measuring wellness programs' value on investment. ####  ##### Beyond reducing medical costs, wellness programs improve employee morale and engagement and reduce absenteeism, presenteeism, and workplace injury, he said, so “let's recognize that the work that we do impacts the entire pie.” ####  ##### Many employers, including Fortune 500 giants such as Dow Chemical Co., General Electric Corp. and PepsiCo Inc., believe that a healthy employee population is a business advantage, said Shelly Wolff, health and workforce effectiveness leader at Towers Watson & Co. in Stamford, Connecticut. ####  ##### However, as Rand Corp. concluded in a recent study of workplace wellness programs, not all generate a positive financial return, and a reduction in health care costs should not be the only indicator of an effective wellness program. The study linked participation in “lifestyle management programs” that promote healthy living to improved health risks and reduced absenteeism. ####  ##### The challenge for benefits leaders is proving the value of wellness programs to top executives, Ms. Wolff said. With value on investment, “you're starting to get at broader business metrics (CEOs and chief financial officers) already believe in.” ####  ##### Where the term originated isn't clear. It may have seeped into workplace wellness from the information technology sector. In 2001, IT consultant Gartner Inc. described value on investment in a research paper advising companies to capture the “soft” benefits of their investments, beyond the easily quantifiable cost savings or revenue generation. ####  ##### “We've always recommended to clients that they think about ... the value of the change that they're trying to bring about and think about it in a broader, more qualitative way,” said Gartner Vice President and analyst Carol Rozwell, a co-author of the report. ####  ##### Employer organizations, providers and consultants are leading the charge to help businesses think beyond ROI. ####  ##### The National Business Group on Health and Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Optum Inc. surveyed 275 large companies last year to identify top reasons for investing in wellness. Reducing employee health risks and health care costs and improving productivity ranked highest, while other key drivers included reducing disability claims, improving employee job satisfaction and improving business performance. ####  ##### Yet only one-third of employers said they have the metrics to justify investments in health and wellness, the survey found. ####  ##### It's not that they don't have the data; it's that the data resides in different departments or with external providers. The difficulty is “being able to pull those data sources together and to understand what it's telling you,” said Karen Marlo, a vice president at the NBGH in Washington. ####  ##### This year, the Health Enhancement Research Organization and Population Health Alliance published a guide to help employers measure and evaluate their workplace wellness programs. One chapter proposes a value-on-investment framework by calculating inputs — wellness program costs, incentives, and outcomes or employers' goals, such as reducing presenteeism (ailing employees working at reduced capacity) or improving job satisfaction. ####  ##### “Just as we easily think of the price of a gallon of gas or a loaf of bread, we can now talk about the price of an ex-smoker or a pound of weight loss,” said Craig Nelson, co-leader of the research organization's and health alliance's value on investment work group and Minneapolis-based director of health services research at American Specialty Health Inc., the parent of the Healthyroads wellness program. Healthyroads provides fitness, nutrition, weight management and other services to health plans and employer groups. ####  ##### While there's no single proven method to measure value on investment, companies are beginning to gather data points and set up dashboards to track variables such as employee absence, disability and turnover. Most, however, are far from spitting out numbers tying wellness efforts to specific outcomes. ####  ##### “We're talking about taking some qualitative data and turning it into something quantitative, and that can be a little bit tricky,” said Tami Simon, managing director of knowledge resources at Buck Consultants at Xerox in Washington. “How do you measure ""I'm happier. I feel better. I like coming to work more?' How do you quantify that for a CFO?” ####  ##### What's more, 47% of U.S. employers in Buck's 2014 Working Well survey said they had not measured specific outcomes of their health promotion programs. ####  ##### But Seth Serxner, Optum's chief health officer in San Francisco, said the value-on-investment exercise is useful because it opens a conversation about where wellness fits into a company's human capital and well-being strategy beyond cost containment. #### "
"Tailor wellness programs to individual workforces for maximum effect","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs"," ##### LAS VEGAS — Rising health care costs are front of mind for most employers, but there are several ways to ease the burden. ####  ##### Implementing a wellness program is one. But companies seeking to reduce health costs through wellness programs should tailor them to the organization's business needs, employees' health risks and the preferences of the employee base, experts say. ####  ##### It's important to view wellness as “part of a strategy of profitability of the company” and not “just a good thing to do,” said Charlie Estey, executive vice president of business development at Schaumburg, Illinois-based Interactive Health Inc. ####  ##### “There's plenty of research to show the impact of wellness, not just on medical costs and productivity, but on the value of the company,” he said during the Society for Human Resource Management Inc.'s recent conference in Las Vegas. ####  ##### Wellness programs also can reduce workplace injuries, workers compensation claims, and absenteeism and presenteeism rates, while boosting productivity and attracting and retaining talent, he said. ####  ##### To implement a successful wellness program and achieve support from the company's leadership, Mr. Estey recommended determining what problem the company is trying to solve and tailoring the program to address that need. For example, he said, if many employees smoke, tools need to be in place to help them quit. ####  ##### It's also important, he said, to educate employees about their role as active health consumers and how unaddressed health risks can increase out-of-pocket costs under a high-deductible health plan. ####  ##### Bruce Elliot, SHRM's Alexandria, Virginia-based benefits manager, said wellness programs work best when companies build them around data from a health risk assessment. If companies are not reacting to that data, then the wellness program isn't “going to bear any fruit,” he said. ####  ##### Another tactic to reduce health care costs is implementing a medical self-care program, said Don Powell, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based American Institute for Preventive Medicine. ####  ##### Medical self-care involves teaching employees to make better decisions about when and when not to access care, he said. ####  ##### “I think too much of our ways of trying to reduce health costs tend to focus on the supply side; that is, having employees pay more out of pocket (and) ... having to get permission before you can do certain things. We need to focus more on the demand side” of employees through programs such as medical self-care, he said. ####  ##### What's more, while a wellness program may take two to three years to show financial benefits, the benefit of medical self-care “occurs almost instantaneously” as employees change their habits of accessing care, he said. ####  ##### Other experts say moving to a defined contribution type of health plan and shifting costs to a private health insurance exchange also can reduce employers' costs. ####  ##### Though a private exchange won't fix health care cost trends, it will engage the employee in the decision-making process and enable the employer to control annual increases in health care costs, said Rob Harkins, Boston-based practice leader of private exchanges at Willis North America Inc. ####  ##### Employers also are looking at telemedicine to reduce medical spending. Receiving health services or education remotely via a live videoconference, not only is a cost-effective alternative to an on-site clinic, it also reduces the need for an employee to go to a more expensive urgent care clinic, said Stewart Levy, president of Princeton, New Jersey-based health care consultancy Health Promotion Solutions. ####  ##### Telemedicine also increases access to care for scattered or rural employees as it alleviates transportation barriers, he said. ####  ##### Twenty-two percent of employers offered telemedicine consultations to employees last year, and 37% said they expect to offer them this year, according to a 2014 Towers Watson & Co. analysis of employers with 1,000 or more employees. Interest in telemedicine is expected to keep growing, and “everything is moving in the right direction from a regulatory perspective,” Mr. Levy said.  “It's all about the care and the ability to provide care more efficiently.” #### "
"More early retirees to be covered via insurance exchanges","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### Employers' move to jettison health insurance for pre-Medicare-eligible retirees is certain to accelerate in the wake of last month's U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of premium subsidies for lower-income individuals getting coverage in the state and federal exchanges. ####  ##### Dropping coverage and directing retirees, in some cases with employer financial support, offers “win-win opportunities” for employers and retirees, said John Grosso, health care actuary and leader of Aon Hewitt's retiree health care task force in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### For employers, the appeal is obvious: With premiums averaging more than $12,000 per year per retiree, according to a 2014 Mercer L.L.C. survey, eliminating those plans would slash employer costs even if they contribute to health reimbursement arrangements to help pre-Medicare-eligible retirees defray some of the cost of buying coverage in a public exchange. ####  ##### “I can't think of an employer for whom this approach would not make sense to consider,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. Employers would have a “more manageable amount that is not subject to health costs and trend,” he said, referring to employers' HRA contributions that retirees could use to purchase exchange coverage. ####  ##### In some cases, retirees wouldn't even tap employers' HRA contributions to buy coverage in the exchange. ####  ##### That is because under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, people whose incomes are between 100% to 400% of the federal level — or $11,700 to $47,080 for an individual — are eligible for federal premium subsidies to buy coverage in public exchanges. ####  ##### The subsidies — in the case of lower-income early retirees — might be far larger than employers' HRA contributions, increasing the likelihood that they would turn down the HRA contribution and take the government's premium subsidy to buy exchange coverage, resulting in additional employer savings. Federal rules make clear that the retirees cannot take both the HRA contribution and the ACA premium subsidy to purchase exchange coverage. ####  ##### For retirees eligible for the government's premium subsidies for exchange plans, the cost savings that they could rack up could be considerable, especially if their former employer previously paid only a small percentage of the premium in the plans they offered to retirees. ####  ##### While the financial advantages of directing the retirees to the public exchanges were obvious, experts say one key issue held employers back from adopting the approach: Would the Supreme Court uphold the IRS rules authorizing federal premium subsidies in both state exchanges and in the 34 states where federal regulators set up exchanges after states officials declined to do so? Plaintiffs in the case alleged that the health care reform law limited the subsidies to those obtaining coverage in state exchanges ####  ##### So the Supreme Court's June ruling upholding the IRS premium subsidy rules “removes one of the last barriers that had been holding back many employers from taking this approach,” Mr. Grosso said. ####  ##### “A major barrier has been taken off the table,” said John Barkett, director of health policy affairs at Towers Watson Exchange Solutions in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Just 26% of employers still offered health insurance to early retirees as of last year, according to Mercer, and the Supreme Court's ruling looks to accelerate that trend. Still, not every employer will adopt the approach. ####  ##### “An employer with high-income pre-65 retirees might be less inclined to suggest that the retirees access a public exchange because they would be less likely to be eligible for subsidies,” said Amy Bergner, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Washington. ####  ##### In addition, some employers may wait to see how successful insurers that offer exchange coverage are in attracting medical providers to their networks. ####  ##### “Employers may want to see more exchange experience before jumping in,” Mr. Barkett said. ####  ##### Plan documents that may bar employers from eliminating early retiree coverage or collective bargaining agreements requiring union agreement also could limit adoption, said Judy Bauserman, a Mercer partner in Washington. ####  ##### Another factor that could hold back employers is a concern that the 2016 elections could result in electing a president who backs repealing the health care reform law that spawned the exchanges and the premium subsidies. ####  ##### “Employers may still have some hesitancy because of political uncertainty,” Ms. Bauserman said. But with the Supreme Court “solidifying the place of exchanges in the marketplace, repeal will be more challenging.” ####  ##### But some observers doubt the law will be repealed. “The ACA is here to stay, even if the GOP wins the presidency,” Mr. Stover said. #### "

"Can seeing a virtual doctor be as good as the real thing?","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Voluntary Benefits"," ##### In need of a way to provide efficient, affordable health care to its employees scattered nationwide, Pitney Bowes Inc. found a solution in telemedicine. ####  ##### The e-commerce, shipping and mailing company's telemedicine portal, launched with American Well Corp. in April 2014, allows workers to visit the Boston-based provider's physicians — as well as Pitney Bowes' on-site clinicians, dietitian, pharmacist and oncology nurse for employees with cancer — through a real-time videoconference, said Mary Bradley, Shelton, Connecticut-based Pitney Bowes' director of health care strategy. ####  ##### It helps boost employee productivity and saves money for participants in Pitney Bowes' consumer-directed health plan, Ms. Bradley said. ####  ##### Employees “literally could have a virtual visit from their office,” allowing them to start recovering sooner than “if they had to wait for a physical visit,” she said. ####  ##### Like Pitney Bowes, more U.S. companies are looking to telemedicine to expand health care access and reduce employees' out-of-pocket costs. ####  ##### Last year, 22% of employers offered telemedicine services to employees, and 37% said they expected to offer telemedicine this year, according to a Towers Watson & Co. survey of employers with 1,000 or more workers. Another 34% were considering offering telemedicine in 2016 or 2017, Towers Watson said. ####  ##### And IHS Technology, a unit of IHS Inc., has projected that 7 million patients worldwide will use telehealth services in 2018, up from 350,000 in 2013. ####  ##### “There's a lot of interest and a lot of questions about what does (telemedicine) really mean to our future health care, how do employers embrace this, or should they?” said Linh Tacker, Tampa, Florida-based vice president at Aon Hewitt, who said she receives calls every week from interested employers. ####  ##### Employers tap telemedicine hoping it will reduce costly emergency room visits for noncritical cases, increase health care access and reduce absenteeism, she said. ####  ##### Telemedicine visits, which typically cost around $40, are cheaper than doctor's office visits, so they help employees in consumer-directed health plans reduce the cost burden, said Alexander Domaszewicz, Irvine, California-based principal at Mercer L.L.C. ####  ##### Telemedicine falls in line with the strategy of urgent care, giving employees another option to save money. But some health professionals and researchers question whether telemedicine measures up to in-person care. ####  ##### Telemedicine takes many forms, but employers who offer telemedicine often provide a direct-to-consumer model, where patients discuss their problem with a clinician through a secure videoconference. ####  ##### This direct-to-consumer model is “where you get the controversy,” said Dr. Lawrence Wechsler, Pittsburgh-based vice president of telemedicine and chairman of neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “This system has to be applied where it can be applied effectively.” ####  ##### In most cases, direct-to-consumer providers such as Teladoc Inc., American Well and Doctor on Demand Inc., limit treatment to conditions such as a runny nose, sore throat or simple rashes, Dr. Wechsler said. ####  ##### The doctor should “be attuned” to that fact and “recognize when something is beyond what should be taken care of” via telemedicine, he said. ####  ##### Another issue is the potential to overprescribe medications, particularly antibiotics, though he said his experience finds telemedicine prescribing rates on par with face-to-face rates. ####  ##### A May Rand Corp. study agrees. It found that patients treated for acute respiratory infections via telemedicine video sessions were as likely to be prescribed antibiotics as patients who went to the doctor's office. ####  ##### However, the study, which compared 1,700 Teladoc appointments with 64,000 in-person visits, found that 86% of telemedicine doctors prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics vs. 56% for in-person visits, which Rand said increases costs and contributes to antibiotic resistance. ####  ##### Teladoc did not respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### “There's concern by organized medicine that the (direct-to-consumer telemedicine) care may not be as good, and I myself have become aware of several cases where care was less than optimal,” said Dr. Karen S. Rheuban, Charlottesville, Virginia-based medical director of the office of telemedicine at the University of Virginia Health System. “Self-reported symptoms aren't always the best methodology.” ####  ##### Some experts say seeing a doctor you don't know could result in inefficient care. In a June statement published in the journal Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics said telemedicine should take place “within the context of the medical home.” ####  ##### “Medical care delivered by the doc who knows the patient and the team of folks working with the doc will be better than care given by someone who does not know the patient,” Dr. Bryan Burke, professor of neonatology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and member of the academy's section on telehealth, said in an email. ####  ##### He also said treating certain conditions, such as a red throat or painful urination, with antibiotics without in-person tests are practices “no reputable authority would condone.” ####  ##### But Dr. Pat Basu, Chicago-based chief medical officer at Doctor on Demand, said in-person tests are not always needed, and the company provides equal or better care. ####  ##### “The exact same thing that we would do in our offices we would do over video to make this diagnosis,” Dr. Basu said. Diagnoses are made following standards and evidence-based guidelines, or patients are referred for an in-person visit, he said. ####  ##### “About 95% of our consultations end in what we consider to be full resolution of your diagnosis,” he said. ####  ##### Other experts question whether a patient-physician relationship can be established without an in-person meeting, and some wonder whether telemedicine will be overused, reducing its cost-savings potential. ####  ##### Many experts agree more research is needed to evaluate direct-to-consumer care as it relates to in-person care. ####  ##### At the same time, 29 states already require health insurers to pay for telemedicine services, according to the American Telemedicine Association. And organizations like the American Medical Association and the Federation of State Medical Boards support telemedicine. ####  ##### “No one is going into this thinking that they are not going to deliver good care. Everyone is trying to deliver the best possible care under the circumstances,” Dr. Wechsler said. #### "
"Competition in pharmacy benefits market intensifies","Benefits Management","Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### While carving out pharmacy benefits management to a specialty provider generally lowers costs for self-funded employers, those seeking such unbundled arrangements are meeting resistance from the insurers that administer their health benefit programs. ####  ##### Meanwhile, pharmacy benefit managers are  intensifying their courtship of self-funded employers as competition escalates in the PBM market after the most recent wave of mergers and UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s decision to handle pharmacy benefit administration inside, experts say (see related story). ####  ##### Today, more than half of self-funded employers contract separately for pharmacy and medical benefit administration, usually with a pharmacy benefit manager for pharmacy benefits and an insurer for medical benefits, said Scott Hengst, a pharmacy consultant at Lambertville, N.J.-based Health Strategies Group Inc. ####  ##### To keep from losing pharmacy benefits administration business, some insurers, such as Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Inc. and Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc., have partnered with PBMs to provide those services at a more competitive price than they could if they were administered in-house, he said. ####  ##### For example, WellPoint sold its PBM subsidiary NextRx to St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. in 2009 and then signed a 10-year pharmacy benefits administration contract with Express Scripts. Similarly, Aetna in 2010 entered into a 12-year contract with Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS Caremark Corp., but kept its in-house PBM to manage clinical programs, protocols and oversight of its pharmacy benefits business. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Conversely, Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth Group Inc., which had contracted for more than a decade with Medco Health Solutions Inc. to provide PBM services to its plan members, severed ties last year with the Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based Medco on the same day Medco's takeover by Express Scripts was announced. UnitedHealth is taking pharmacy benefits management back in-house under OptumRx Inc., a rebranding of the former Prescription Solutions, a PBM that UnitedHealth picked up when it acquired Cypress, Calif.-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in 2005. ####  ##### Other insurers, concerned about losing revenues and rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers for dispensing large amounts of certain drugs, are increasing the administrative-services-only fees charged for managing medical benefits if an employer attempts to contract separately with a PBM, sources said. ####  ##### “Activity regarding jacking up ASO fees if you carve out isn't new, but insurers are a little bit more aggressive now than in the past,” said David Dross, managed pharmacy practice leader for Mercer L.L.C. in Houston. He said insurers “want to keep the pharmacy business because it's a source of revenue and a source of profit.” Frequently, “they retain the rebates as part of the arrangement and then say to the plan sponsor they are using the rebates to defray the administration fee, but the rebate is a good bit larger than the defrayed administration fee,” Mr. Dross said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Allan Zimmerman, national pharmacy practice director at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York, said insurers are reluctant to unbundle the pharmacy benefit component from an ASO contract because it weakens their ability to purchase large volumes of prescription drugs at a discount. ####  ##### “The PBM contract might have some sort of component based on volume, and unbundling and allowing spinoff of significant portions of the pharmacy benefit out of their scope and influence could have an impact on the tier or discount that they get. So if they lost another 1 million lives, they might fall a tier,” he said. ####  ##### A few years ago, when Dan Pikelny, director of health benefits and productivity at Navistar Inc. in Lisle, Ill., attempted to carve out pharmacy benefits for a small group of employees Navistar attained through an acquisition, its insurer attempted to increase ASO fees. Instead, Mr. Pikelny moved the medical plan and pharmacy benefits administration away from that insurer. ####  ##### “When we tried to pull it away to consolidate under our main PBM contract, the carrier threatened to increase ASO fees by 30%. We moved both the PBM and ASO away from that carrier, consolidating it with the Navistar program,” he said. ####  ##### More recently, when bidding out separate contracts for medical and pharmacy benefits for 70,000 Navistar benefit plan members, CVS Caremark offered better pricing on a carved-out arrangement than Navistar could obtain in a bundled arrangement with its insurer, Mr. Pikelny said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Many employers, if they went to their health insurer and said they wanted to carve out prescription drugs, of course the insurer balked,” said Nadina Rosier, North American practice leader for pharmacy benefits at Towers Watson & Co. in New York. Insurers said they would have to replace the lost revenue by increasing ASO fees anywhere from 10% to sometimes double, she said. ####  ##### However, with pharmacy being the fastest-growing component of health benefits for many employers, “many self-insured employers have looked at the carve-out value proposition. On the financial side, there's the attraction of being able to negotiate more transparency and savings,” she said. ####  ##### Moreover, because PBMs specialize in pharmaceutical management, they have better track records than insurers in addressing that component of self-funded employers' rapidly escalating health benefit costs, she said. ####  ##### “You're hiring a company that only does pharmacy. By concentrating volume within a PBM, they have the best purchasing rights to negotiate the best deals with manufacturers,” said William A. Schlag, Boston-based senior vp in Willis Group Holdings P.L.C.'s human capital practice. “Second, they are able to build therapeutic resource centers with specially trained pharmacists to measure and monitor medication adherence. Health plans can do all those things. However, very few do because pharmacy is not the major part of their business.” #### "
"Pharmacy benefit managers pursue self-funded employers","Benefits Management",""," ##### Pharmacy benefit managers are intensifying their courtship of self-funded employers in the wake of recent industry consolidation and other developments, including a decision by  UnitedHealth Group Inc. to sever its ties with Medco Health Solutions Inc. ####  ##### Once the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based Medco lost a contract serving some 12 million members of Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth the same day St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. announced its acquisition. ####  ##### Now, UnitedHealth is providing PBM services internally via its OptumRx Inc. subsidiary, a rebranding of the former Prescription Solutions, a firm that UnitedHealth picked up when it acquired Cypress, Calif.-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in 2005. OptumRx also is competing for self-funded employer business, sources said. ####  ##### “OptumRx is capturing a lot of business,” said Susan Hayes, a principal at Pharmacy Outcomes Specialists L.L.C., a Lake Zurich, Ill.-based pharmacy benefit consulting firm. She said that UnitedHealth is taking a “write-off” on its PBM business to reduce its profit margin so it can better meet the new minimum medical-loss ratios for its insured business set under the Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act beginning this year. ####  ##### UnitedHealth did not respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### Meanwhile, Catamaran Corp., the nation's fourth-largest PBM based on prescription volume created by the merger of Lisle, Ill.-based SXC Health Solutions Corp. with Rockville, Md.-based Catalyst Health Solutions Inc., promises to be a “disruptive model” in the marketplace by offering better service and greater cost savings to self-funded employers, sources said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “PBMs are definitely going after the self-funded business, but that's not new,” said William A. Schlag, a Boston-based senior vp in Willis Group Holdings P.L.C.'s human capital practice. “There's renewed energy because of consolidation. There's increased competition in the PBM world.” ####  ##### “The PBM marketplace is a buyers' market for self-funded employers,” said Robert Kalman, a principal in Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s national pharmacy practice in Washington. “Over the past five years, there's been rapid consolidation in the PBM industry starting with CVS Inc. buying Caremark in 2007, the Express Scripts acquisitions, culminating with Medco last year to produce the largest PBM in the country with over 100 million lives. ####  ##### “With the consolidation, there has been intense competition among PBMs for self-funded employer business. To get that business, they either have to buy other PBMs or take away business in competitive bidding situations. This puts the employer in an enviable position to achieve very, very aggressive pricing and other terms,” Mr. Kalman said. #### "
"Benefits administration vendors retool to help firms comply with reporting rules","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Providers of benefits administration outsourcing services are scrambling to help employers comply with upcoming tax reporting requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but few can transmit that information directly to the IRS. ####  ##### While some human resources information system providers can perform services such as tax filing in addition to benefits administration and payroll processing, systems built solely to perform health and welfare benefits administration historically have not had such capabilities, experts say. ####  ##### Some providers are retooling to meet the new ACA reporting requirements, while others are partnering with firms that already have tax-reporting capabilities. ####  ##### JoAnne Pettijohn, a Dallas-based solutions consultant in Lockton Cos. L.L.C.'s human resource technology outsourcing practice, said while most benefit administration outsourcing pro-viders “can help employers gather the data and help prepare the reports, the filing is going to be the difficult component.” ####  ##### “Currently, the only choice is to prepare the report with all the integral data and then deliver it to the client so the employer can file it with their tax filing, but there is no electronic interface at this point,” Ms. Pettijohn said. ####  ##### “There are a lot of stand-alone ACA technology vendors that have come to the rescue, but they're not benefit administration vendors,” she said. “A lot of benefit administration vendors are partnering with these stand-alone ACA vendors, but a stand-alone benefit administration vendor may not have these capabilities.” ####  ##### Mercer L.L.C. recently introduced its Employer Shared Responsibility software that can accept data feeds from payroll systems to track hours and report who has met the 30-hour threshold for benefits eligibility, said Kerry Donoghue, Norwood, Massachusetts-based partner and health and benefits administration business leader at Mercer. ####  ##### “We can feed a file to their payroll vendor or another third party, but there's not the ability for us right now to do a tax filing,” Ms. Donoghue said. “We do something similar with the W-2 reporting.” ####  ##### Using Mercer's benefit administration outsourcing systems for tax reporting “would require us to do additional coding,” she said. “We also would have to do additional work with the IRS from a licensing perspective.” ####  ##### Similarly, Aon Hewitt provides “data files to support the filing requirement, as much of this information is on file as part of the benefits administration services we provide,” said Craig Rosenberg, the consultant's Norwalk, Connecticut-based health and welfare benefits administration practice leader. ####  ##### The files must include demographic, enrollment, cost and other information. ####  ##### “We are currently working through the approach related to the actual IRS filing and creation of tax forms,” he said, but U.S. Treasury Department guidance must be issued first. “Draft forms have been released, but filing instructions have not yet been provided.” ####  ##### Tony DeNucci, managing director of benefits outsourcing at Towers Watson & Co. in Minneapolis, said clients are asking for help with the Internal Revenue Code 6055 and 6056 reporting requirements on health insurance offered, which go into effect for the 2015 tax year. ####  ##### “That is something that we can help clients with, but we do have to modify our processes,” Mr. DeNucci said. “Under our traditional outsourcing agreement, it was not something we were contracted to do.” ####  ##### Charleston, South Carolina-based Benefitfocus Inc. announced a joint venture last fall with Equifax Workforce Solutions, a unit of Equifax Inc., to provide administration and reporting tools to determine benefit eligibility for part-time and seasonal employees, said Shandon Fowler, director of product management for marketplaces at Benefitfocus. ####  ##### “This was something that caught everybody off guard,” he said. “It was something that hadn't been done before. One of the reasons that Treasury delayed the reporting requirements was because there weren't any current systems capable of doing it.” ####  ##### Perhaps the biggest reason so many outside providers of benefits administration are ill-equipped to perform this new reporting task is that “this is tax reporting, not benefits administration,” said Ray Grove, product marketing manager at Convey Compliance Systems L.L.C., a nonwage third-party tax information reporting provider based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. “One of the things that the ACA has done is to complicate things for employers. This is very much a tax process; it just has to do with health care.” ####  ##### But “even if an employer were to use a stand-alone outsourced ACA administrator, they are still going to be dependent on eligibility and enrollment data from their benefits outsourcing vendor,” said Bruce Gillis, health and wellness practice lead at Xerox Corp. in Louisville, Kentucky. “The system of record is clearly going to be the health and welfare benefits administration system.” #### "
"ALCO Stores finds provider to help with automated health benefits enrollment","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### ALCO Stores Inc. changed benefit administration outsourcing providers this year to help it meet Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requirements that the chain of more than 200 stores provide automated enrollment to employees and extend benefits to those working 30 or more hours per week. ####  ##### As a retailer, Coppell, Texas-based ALCO Stores has a large variable-hour workforce. Benefitfocus Inc.'s HR InTouch Marketplace, used in conjunction with the ACA Management Platform from Equifax Workforce Solutions, gave ALCO the tools it needed to measure and track the eligibility of its workers as required by ACA's employer mandate, Shatana Allen, director of human resources at ALCO Stores, said in statement. ####  ##### “This was the comprehensive solution we needed to improve employee engagement and be more strategic in our benefits administration,” she said. “We are excited to roll this out starting with open enrollment for our variable-hour workers in November.” ####  ##### Such provider switching has surged in the past several years, mostly in response to ACA, according to a report by Everest Global Inc., a Dallas-based advisory and research firm. ####  ##### “Buyers felt threatened from compliance-related issues and hence switched service providers to avoid severe penalties,” according to the report. Moreover, “over the last few years, the pricing for (benefits administration outsourcing) has declined and buyers either renegotiate the existing contracts or switch providers to get more value for the money spent.” ####  ##### Though Everest Global expects such switching to decline this year from its peak in 2012-2013, it likely will remain higher “due to the market being more dynamic and difficult in terms of more complex requirements” because of ACA, Arkadev Basak, practice director at Everest Global, said in an email response to questions from Business Insurance. #### "
"Employers want unbiased advice on private health care exchanges","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### As private health insurance exchanges evolve, some benefits consultants are trying to distinguish themselves as unbiased advisers in a marketplace dominated by companies offering advisory services alongside their own branded exchange products. ####  ##### Months of conversations with current and prospective clients recently led Pacific Resources Benefits Advisors L.L.C. to launch a specialized consulting practice designed to provide employers with independent, third-party guidance on private exchanges, company executives say. ####  ##### “A good number of employers raised the issue of consulting objectivity and bias where companies were marketing and selling an exchange platform,” said Jody Hunter, Resources Benefits' Chicago-based vice president of marketplace solutions. ####  ##### Additionally, findings of the company's February employer survey about private health insurance exchanges revealed significant interest in independent advisory services. ####  ##### Although its parent company, insurance brokerage Brown & Brown Inc., launched a proprietary exchange platform last year, Mr. Hunter said that product is not included in the consultant's assessments of exchange platforms. ####  ##### “The marketing for the Brown & Brown product is really focused on employers with under 500 employees, and that's not a market segment that we focus on,” Mr. Hunter said. “We're focused on the segment that, on average, totals about 10,000 or more employees per client.” ####  ##### Several other consultants, including PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P., Laurus Strategies and Sibson Consulting, also have elected to not develop in-house private exchange products and instead have launched exchange consulting practices. ####  ##### “We felt that if we had our own exchange product that we had to sell, it would put us in an untenable position and prevent us from being as objective as we want to be,” said Nancy Scola Lombaer, a Chicago-based partner at Laurus Strategies. ####  ##### Benefits brokers and consultants with considerable investments in their respective exchange platforms — including Towers Watson & Co. and Aon Hewitt — said they also provide clients with unbiased advice on private exchanges, at least in the initial phases of an employer's inquiry. ####  ##### “At that early stage, the relationship that we've built with clients as trusted advisers still holds, and we generally haven't had any issues or questions around objectivity from clients,” said Jim Winkler, Aon Hewitt's chief innovation officer of health and benefits in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### However, some private exchange providers agreed that independent assessments can be valuable to their clients, particularly when employers seek comparisons of external exchange offerings. ####  ##### We've been pretty clear in making the point that any company that owns an exchange really shouldn't be in the business of evaluating which exchange makes sense for an employer, because you can't really be objective in that evaluation,” said David Ostendorf, chief health care actuary at Towers Watson in Milwaukee. “That's something that almost always needs to be done by an objective third party.” ####  ##### Other benefits brokers, including Lockton Cos. L.L.C. and Crystal & Company, also have positioned themselves as independent advisers on private exchanges, taking the position that their limited engagement in the exchange marketplace affords them greater objectivity than their competitors. ####  ##### “Once you start making financial investments into certain ex-changes, I think it changes the mindset of the companies providing these services to the extent that they're focusing on generating a return on their investment,” said Michael Grant, New York-based executive managing director of employee benefits services at Crystal & Company. ####  ##### One reason independent consultants cite for employers' demand for unbiased advisory services is the heightened attention private exchanges have drawn from em-ployers' chief financial officers and other senior executives, particularly due to the economic and administrative complexity of switching to an exchange. ####  ##### “Even if the employer's human resources or benefits manager has a long-standing relationship with their broker or consultant, because you now have the CFO or another senior executive involved in these discussions about private exchanges, there's a greater emphasis on the need for an independent view of the marketplace,” said Barbara Gniewek, a New York-based principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. ####  ##### Independent consultants say not offering proprietary exchanges  makes it easier to collect detailed product and pricing information from multiple exchange owners. ####  ##### “That's one of the reasons we came out pretty aggressively to say we're not building an ex-change, because we wanted to remove that barrier,” said Christopher Calvert, New York-based senior vice president and health practice leader at Sibson Consulting, a division of Segal Group Inc. “Since we've done that, the private exchange providers have become much more willing to discuss the details of their products.” ####  ##### Going forward, most benefits service providers said they expect more companies to offer independent consulting focused exclusively on private exchanges, especially given the speed with which marketplace conditions shift. ####  ##### “We saw a similar dynamic unfold with the advent of benefits administration outsourcing, and I think the exchange marketplace is evolving in the exact same way,” Mr. Ostendorf said. “Over time, it will become very unusual for even large organizations to go out and make this decision without a third-party search consultant helping to guide the process.” #### "
"Direct contracts with medical providers help self-insured employers control costs","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### A growing number of self-insured employers are bypassing health plan administrators and contracting directly with providers in efforts to limit the increases in their health care costs. ####  ##### Direct contracting isn't new, but more employers are considering it among other cost-cutting measures, and many providers are better prepared to run the numbers. ####  ##### According to Aon Hewitt's “2014 Health Care Survey,” conducted between December 2013 and January of this year, 11% of employers are engaging in some form of direct health care provider and service contracting during this plan year, and 28% expect to do so in the next three to five years. ####  ##### “Having that direct contract opens the door to discussions about cost and performance in ways that employers who are just doing business with health plans ... never see,” said Donna Marshall, executive director of the Colorado Business Group on Health in Lakewood, Colorado. ####  ##### Salt Lake City-based researcher and consultant Leavitt Partners L.L.C. predicted in a May research brief that “employer-provider relationships are likely to proliferate” in the next several years as health care costs “continue to escalate.” ####  ##### William DeMarco, president and CEO of DeMarco & Associates Inc., a Rockford, Illinois-based health care consultant, said the health care reform law is stoking hospital-physician consolidation, which also is driving up costs, leading to employers' “renewed interest” in direct contracting. ####  ##### Many employers also are unhappy with the cost and outcomes data they receive from their health plan administrators, he said. ####  ##### “They'd like to know, well, how did this person end up in the hospital?” Mr. DeMarco said. Few health insurers and third-party administrators provide data linking a physician's diagnosis to a hospital's cost and the outcome of the patient's care, he said. ####  ##### Greg Mansur, a partner in the health and welfare consulting practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Los Angeles, said the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's looming excise tax on high-cost health plans, scheduled to go into effect in 2018, and an aging workforce also are increasing the pressure on employers to use cost-control opportunities such as direct contracting. ####  ##### “Doctors and hospitals almost expect a direct contracting overture,” said A. Michael La Penna, founder and principal of health care industry consultant The La Penna Group Inc. in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ####  ##### Whether employers pay a monthly fee per member or a bundled rate, significant savings can be achieved, experts say. Some employers are negotiating narrow networks and changing plans to persuade employees to use the network for some or all of their care. And in suburban Denver, the City of Arvada, Colorado, already is seeing encouraging results through its recent primary care contract with Paladina Health L.L.C. ####  ##### Most employers are looking to save 5% to 10% of their health care spend, Mr. Mansur said. Some providers promise even greater savings, he said, cautioning employers to carefully scrutinize those deals. ####  ##### Intel Corp., the world's largest computer-chip maker, struck a deal in 2011 with Presbyterian Healthcare Services in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to serve  3,500 employees and their dependents at its manufacturing facility in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. ####  ##### Under the value-based agreement, rolled out in 2013, Intel pays the organization, which has 100 clinics and eight hospitals in the state, a monthly fee per member, and the two organizations share in any risks or savings above or below a specified target. Intel projected savings of $8 million to $10 million through 2017 as a result of the direct contracting arrangement, structured as an accountable care organization. ####  ##### AtlantiCare, an Atlantic City, New Jersey, health care organization, is negotiating direct contracts with local employers through its ACO. It rolled out the network to its own 8,500 employees and dependents in 2011. Monthly costs per member that had been projected to increase by 7% in 2012 actually decreased by 4%, and costs remained flat in 2013, said Steven Blumberg, senior vice president of AtlantiCare Health Solutions, the ACO. ####  ##### Some employers are seeking direct contracts for high-cost care, such as heart surgery or hip replacements, consultants say. ####  ##### When Greenville, South Carolina-based Michelin North America Inc. examined its health care spending, musculoskeletal-related expenses ranked No. 1, said Chris Mattern, the tire maker's former manager of worksite health and wellness programs and now the company's facility manager. To manage that expense, the company signed with Tallahassee, Florida-based Integrated Mechanical Care, whose clinicians follow strict musculoskeletal care guidelines. ####  ##### Michelin declined to discuss its results, but Integrated Medical Care President Chad Gray said employers can reduce total musculoskeletal spending by 40% to 60%, depending on plan design, employee communications and other variables. #### "
"Angela Braly steps down as WellPoint CEO","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Wellpoint"," ##### Correcting the management missteps and anemic earnings that led to last week's abrupt departure of Angela Braly as president and CEO of WellPoint Inc. must be a top priority for her successor, analysts said. ####  ##### Ms. Braly, the Indianapolis-based managed care company's chief executive since 2007, stepped down last week amid growing pressure from investors dissatisfied with the company's financial performance. ####  ##### In a statement, WellPoint said it is actively searching for a successor. ####  ##### John Cannon, an executive vice president and WellPoint's general counsel, corporate secretary and chief public affairs officer, has been named interim president and CEO. Jackie Ward, the company's lead director, will replace Ms. Braly as a nonexecutive chair of WellPoint's board of directors. ####  ##### In the statement, Ms. Ward said the board stands behind strategic decisions made during Ms. Braly's five-year tenure, but felt that “now is the right time for a leadership change.” ####  ##### “Our board continues to believe that time will prove the wisdom of potentially transformative actions taken under Angela's leadership,” Ms. Ward said. “We believe the remaining executive team is dynamic and strong, with great potential to drive WellPoint's future success.” ####  ##### A WellPoint spokes-woman said Ms. Braly did not plan to comment on her departure from the company. ####  ##### Analysts said overly aggressive pricing on WellPoint's commercial group lines, poor benefit plan designs in certain segments of its Medicare Advantage business and lingering integration issues from its 2004 merger with Anthem Inc. were among issues troubling investors the past two years. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “There had been pressure from investors for this to happen for some time,” said David Windley, a Nashville, Tenn.-based managing director at Jefferies & Co. Inc. ####  ##### “Under Ms. Braly's watch, there had been some underwriting mistakes and missteps in the operations,” he said. “There was a belief that the company was underearning and needed fresh leadership.” ####  ##### Analysts said the final catalyst for the leadership change likely was WellPoint's most recent earnings report, which noted a 7.7% drop in first-half 2012 profits, to $1.5 billion. First-half revenue increased just 2.7% over prior-year results, as WellPoint's enrollments dropped 1.9% to 33.5 million from a year earlier, including 169,000 commercial segment members. ####  ##### “We've actually been pretty vocal about leadership at WellPoint,” said Alex Morozov, global health care equity research director at Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. “We've called them out for a number of execution mishaps, so we feel like this announcement supports our positive take on the company but negative take on the management team.” ####  ##### In a July conference call, Ms. Braly and other WellPoint executives attributed disappointing first-half results to unexpected membership losses and spikes in medical cost trends and utilization rates, notably in outpatient care, physician visits and specialty pharmaceuticals. ####  ##### However, analysts were skeptical of the company's explanation, noting that costs and utilization rates didn't appear to affect most of WellPoint's competitors to the same extent. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “They sort of went overboard in saying that they were just the first ones to get hit with these trends and that they were trying to be as transparent as possible with the market,” Mr. Windley said. “When you look at the things that they discussed, and then look at the things that some of the other insurers were saying, you see that they're really not first.” ####  ##### The day after announcing Ms. Braly's departure, WellPoint's stock price rose more than 8% over the previous day's close. ####  ##### “We remain bullish on the stock, and we continue to recommend shares,” Mr. Morozov said. “WellPoint has definitely had some issues in the past, but it's also one of the strongest operators in the space. It's an exciting business, but it's been severely mismanaged.” ####  ##### Analysts said questions surrounding WellPoint's strategy going forward likely would remain unanswered until a successor is named. ####  ##### “A lot of investors wanted this leadership change, so they see this news as a step in the right direction, but it's only one step,” Mr. Windley said. “In my mind, the next leadership announcement is really important.” ####  ##### In a note to investors, Steve Zaharuk, senior vice president at New York-based Moody's Investors Services Inc., called the leadership disruption “somewhat troublesome” at a time when WellPoint is attempting to close its acquisition of Amerigroup Corp., preparing for the full implementation of the health care reform law and addressing the rising medical cost trends it cited in its second-quarter earnings report. ####  ##### “While the recent and very public reports of calls for Ms. Braly's resignation were a distraction for the company, the current leadership uncertainty is unsettling during this crucial period for WellPoint,” Mr. Zaharuk said. “At best, it will likely be several months before a permanent CEO is named and begins to address WellPoint's strategic direction and operational issues.” #### "
"Cultural differences, insurance laws challenge global wellness strategies","Benefits Management",""," ##### American employers hoping to expand their workplace wellness strategies globally must account for variations in the needs and resources of their foreign-based employees to effectively design, implement and monitor wellness programs overseas. ####  ##### While a slight majority of large U.S.-based employers provide workplace wellness and employee health management programs on a global scale, several factors can impede an employer from establishing a truly global program, experts say. ####  ##### Fifty-one percent of U.S.-based multinational firms applied a global strategy to their employee health management programs in 2013, according to a survey of more than 1,000 employers in 37 countries by Secaucus, New Jersey-based Buck Consultants at Xerox. ####  ##### “Companies that take this on really have their work cut out for them,” said David Ratcliffe, a Washington-based principal at Buck Consultants. “We've seen the prevalence of wellness programs in other countries increase generally over the last several years, but there are still a lot of barriers to really rolling out a global wellness strategy.” ####  ##### For U.S.-based employers, experts say applying a workplace wellness strategy globally may be especially challenging, as health insurance is sponsored at least in part, if not in whole, by the government in most other industrialized countries. ####  ##### “In the U.S., employers obviously have a vested interest in the health and wellness of their employees from a financial perspective in that they're the ones paying for their health care,” said Elizabeth Greenbaum, a Hong Kong-based assistant director of the Global Business Group on Health. “Outside of the United States, employers for the most part aren't incurring the medical costs associated with poor employee health care, so they're not driven to improve employee health from that perspective.” ####  ##### “In general, the U.S. mindset on workplace wellness isn't going to work,” said Thomas Dolan, Boston-based senior vice president of global employee benefits solutions at Willis North America Inc. “In fact, ""well-being' is probably the more widely applicable term being used globally, as opposed to wellness. What we're seeing now is a new focus among employers on adopting a global well-being framework that's configurable and adaptable to local environments.” ####  ##### The word “well-being” is understood in most countries to encompass more than employees' physical health, i.e. their mental and emotional health, Mr. Dolan said. ####  ##### Rather than designing wellness programs around cost-reduction goals, experts say employers' workplace wellness programs most frequently gain traction with managers and employees in foreign countries when they are designed to address elements of the organizations' local or global competitiveness, particularly their value proposition as employers. ####  ##### “Outside the U.S., these programs tend to focus on employee engagement and talent,” said Dr. Lorna Friedman, a New York-based partner in Mercer L.L.C.'s global health management practice. “What we're hearing from senior human resource professionals and other executives globally is that they have a talent shortage and a skills gap, and that healthy populations and work environments are an imperative part of the human capital dialogue.” ####  ##### Once global wellness objectives are established, experts say employers will need to consult locally with designated leaders within their organization, health care providers and licensed wellness providers to design and communicate a suite of culturally and demographically relevant wellness activities. ####  ##### “You need a flexible framework with a set of adaptable pillars,” said Francis Coleman, director of international consulting at Towers Watson & Co. in Los Angeles. “For example, one pillar might be stress management, another could be physical activity and another might be smoking cessation. From that, you let each of your local groups select the most appropriate set of pillars for their workforce, depending on the specific issues that are most prevalent amongst their population.” ####  ##### U.S. employers should pay especially close attention to international data privacy laws, experts say. In the European Union, employee health information is classified as sensitive personal data and subject to enhanced restrictions regarding its collection, retention and processing by employers. ####  ##### E.U. member states — as well as nations that include Argentina, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland — also prohibit private companies from exporting personal data to countries that do not meet the E.U. privacy standard. ####  ##### “When it comes to sensitive health data, you're going to need to be extra vigilant,” said Christopher Walter, a London-based partner at law firm Covington & Burling L.L.P. “Privacy must be the top consideration.” ####  ##### Employers establishing wellness programs overseas also must consider local employment regulations. Specifically, Mr. Walter said, employers should consider whether local regulators might view a particular wellness activity or initiative as being indirectly discriminatory for one or more protected classes of employee, potentially leading to civil actions or fines. ####  ##### On the other hand, U.S.-based employers may find some countries' laws to be more relaxed than American statutes. In many Latin American and European Union member states, Mr. Walter said, employers are generally not liable for indirectly discriminating against a certain group of employees if the company can demonstrate that the action in question serves a proportionately greater company objective when compared with its negative effect on the individuals alleging discrimination. ####  ##### By contrast, U.S. laws generally require employers accused of direct or indirect discriminatory acts to demonstrate both a legitimate objective for the offending act and that it was the least restrictive means of meeting that objective. ####  ##### How nondiscrimination rules are applied to workplace health management and wellness programs is largely unknown, Mr. Walter said, as actual cases addressing the issue have been rare within the last few years. ####  ##### “Over time, I suspect we might begin to see some of those issues teased out,” he said. “It will be important for employers to think carefully about the potential impacts.” #### "
"Q&A: James Klein, American Benefits Council","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### For years, employers have been grappling with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as reform law provisions took effect and regulations were published. At the same time, federal lawmakers, especially Republicans in the House of Representatives, have launched drives to modify and, in some cases, repeal the law. In a recent conversation with Business Insurance Editor-at-Large Jerry Geisel, James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, a Washington-based employer benefits lobbying organization, discusses the likelihood of further changes to the law. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: Many measures have been introduced in Congress that would amend the ACA. The one that has gone the furthest — to determine if employers are complying with a provision that will require them to offer coverage to full-time employees or pay a stiff penalty — would change the definition of a full-time employees to those working an average of 40 hours a week from the current 30-hour a week standard. What is the likelihood of that proposal winning approval? ####  ##### A: There is no question that changing the definition of who is considered a full-time employee would be welcomed by many employers, who traditionally have not used a 30-hour weekly standard. The likelihood of that happening while possible — there is some bipartisan interest in it — is challenging. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the change from 30 to 40 hours would cost the federal government nearly $74 billion over 10 years. Congressional Demo-crats undoubtedly would try to find a way to require Republicans to pay for that revenue loss. Certainly, though, if Republicans were to take control of the Senate, the likelihood of that legislation going forward does increase. ####  ##### Q: What other changes would employers like to see made to the law? ####  ##### A: First, repeal or significant modification of the so-called Cadillac plan tax. If it can't be repealed, then creating a safe harbor so that employers can design around it. And more realistic indexing would be helpful. Second, the American Benefits Council has proposed establishing a mechanism so employers could fund health reimbursement arrangements, or similar accounts, so that individuals could purchase coverage in public exchanges. And third, repeal of the automatic enrollment requirement. Automatic enrollment has worked wonderfully in the retirement plan context, but in the health care context, where Americans are required to have coverage, it really is not needed. And, it can result in individuals being made ineligible for subsidies if they wanted to obtain coverage through public exchanges. ####  ##### Q: A very visible benefit of the ACA has been the decrease in the number of uninsured. From an employer perspective, what have been other positive aspects of the law? ####  ##### A: The employer community has always sought to address the uninsured problem. So the reduction in the number of uninsured is a positive. If the exchanges work, there is a possibility of repealing or modifying COBRA. We already have seen the public exchange become a venue for coverage for early retirees. Arguably, the law has created a better individual insurance market place where people can obtain coverage notwithstanding their health care conditions. ####  ##### Q: What have been the negative aspects of the law? ####  ##### A: The administrative demands are enormous. American Benefits Council members already provide excellent coverage. Yet the law requires them to jump through numerous hoops. On the other hand, small employers, where the level of coverage is of course the lowest, are exempt from the law. So, there is an inherent contradiction why should large employers, who are already providing excellent coverage, be required to take all these steps? Also, the rules implementing the law have made it much more difficult for employers to use outcomes-based wellness programs, which is a high priority for corporate America. #### "

"Private health insurance exchanges gain traction with employers","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Aon Hewitt, Towers Watson"," ##### For decades, the way employers offered health insurance coverage to their employees and retirees changed little. Now more and more companies are moving to a new health benefits delivery model using private health insurance exchanges. ####  ##### Under the old model, employers, often with the assistance of consultants, brokers and agents, decided the insurers from which they would purchase coverage, the number and types of health plans they would offer employees, and how much they would contribute toward the cost of the coverage. ####  ##### In addition, employers were deeply involved in plan administration, arranging and holding open enrollments for employees to choose one of the plans offered. ####  ##### By contrast, with private insurance exchanges, employees and retirees select from a variety of health care plans and designs, with the employer's role largely limited to deciding how much of the premium it will pay. ####  ##### While the move to private exchanges is not entirely new, there has been an accelerated shift in the past year, said Michael Thompson, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### In the past few weeks, big and well-known industry-leading employers, including IBM Corp. and Walgreen Co., have disclosed that, starting next year, their employees or retirees will choose health care plans offered by insurers participating in private exchanges. One exchange alone — the one unveiled a year ago by Aon Hewitt — has seen the number of participating employers leap sixfold to 18 from three, with total enrollment more than doubling to about 600,000. ####  ##### Other private exchanges also are growing quickly. Eleven employers with 400,000 employees and dependents have signed up with an exchange offered by Buck Consultants L.L.C. that will start next year. Mercer L.L.C. said nine employers with 35,000 enrollees have signed up for its new exchange, with an announcement expected soon that additional employers have opted for the exchange. ####  ##### And OneExchange Retiree, a Towers Watson & Co. exchange offering coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees, has seen the number of clients jump nearly 50% this year alone to 300. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The recent growth spurt may be just the beginning. “In the future, exchanges will be the standard business model” for providing coverage, said Alan Cohen, co-founder and chief strategy officer in New York with Liazon Corp., which operates the Bright Choices private insurance exchange. ####  ##### “It is reasonable to expect that the overall marketplace will double every year for the next five years,” said Ken Sperling, Aon Hewitt national strategy leader in Norwalk, Conn. ####  ##### Others are more cautious in their growth predictions. ####  ##### “It might be premature to give some sort of projection that this is going to be the model of the future. What we can say is that there seems to be great interest from corporate America,” said Mercer President and CEO Julio Portalatin in New York. ####  ##### That corporate interest in private exchanges is being driven by several factors, according to employers who have signed up: ####  ##### • A desire to give their employees or retirees more health care plan options. ####  ##### “Choice was an important factor,” said Steve Heckert, vice president of human resources in Clearwater, Fla., for GFI Software. The company offers employees up to six health care plans, compared with just one plan previously, through the Bright Choices exchange. “Employees are able to select a health plan that works for their pocketbook with coverage appropriate for them.” ####  ##### A spokesman for Deerfield, Ill.-based Walgreen said, “We are trying to provide more options for our very diverse workforce that covers 240,000 team members across all 50 states. With more options, employees can choose a plan that is more personalized for their health care needs.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### About 35% of Walgreen employees are single and under age 30, and “with the flexibility of our new program, they can choose a plan that provides the kind of coverage they need — 100% of their preventive care with premiums as low as $5 a month for a high-deductible plan,” the spokesman said. ####  ##### Walgreen employees will be able to choose from up to 25 different plans offered by the five insurers participating in the Aon Hewitt exchange. This year, employees could choose from only two insurers who each offered two plans. ####  ##### • Reduction in overhead. ####  ##### “For clients, we take on all the contracting and negotiating,” said Sherri Bockhorst, national practice leader of health exchange solutions for Buck Consultants. ####  ##### “In an environment where HR staff resources are severely constrained, the ability to go to an exchange and say, ""You handle compliance. You handle employees' questions,”"" is a big resource saver for employers, Mercer's Mr. Portalatin said. ####  ##### Employers agree. “That allows us to concentrate on meeting the many other needs of our people,” said Al Rapp, vice president of corporate health care in Atlanta with United Parcel Service Inc., which has offered health care coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees through an Aon Hewitt exchange since 2012. ####  ##### • Making employer costs more predictable. ####  ##### When employers adopt the exchange model, they typically set a fixed premium contribution amount they will pay. Previously, “the amount of the annual benefit rate increases drove our benefits strategy more than we liked. With the exchange delivery mechanism, we're able to decide on our strategy and associated budget independent of the rate increases,” GFI Software's Mr. Heckert said. #### "
"Quad/Graphics drops direct health care contracting, switches to Anthem network","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### Quad/Graphics Inc., a longtime national leader in direct health care contracting, is canceling its roughly 400 medical provider contracts in Wisconsin and shifting to Anthem Inc.'s national network effective Jan. 1, 2015. ####  ##### The Sussex, Wisconsin-based commercial printer will save “millions of dollars” a year by switching to Anthem's network for all health care services for its employees, said John Neuberger, Quad's director of client partnerships. ####  ##### The move is the opposite of the trend among self-insured employers, in which 11% already contract directly with providers for various health care services and 28% are considering doing so in the next three to five years to reduce costs, according to an Aon Hewitt survey released earlier this year. ####  ##### Quad offers its 6,200 Wisconsin employees a narrow network of doctors, hospitals and ancillary providers. ####  ##### Many directly contracted health care relationships go back 15 years, with pricing that historically beat national insurers, Mr. Neuberger said. But as health plans have expanded their presence in the state, their discounts have improved, he said. ####  ##### “We did get good pricing, but in large markets like this, I'm learning it's just hard to compete with the big guys,” Mr. Neuberger said. ####  ##### Quad conducted a request for proposals in the first half of the year to compare its direct contract pricing with national insurers'. By summer, it decided to go with Anthem's proposal. ####  ##### The new package replaces about 400 direct contracts with providers covering a broad range of services. ####  ##### “We were buying everything, and that was kind of the challenge of renegotiating all of those things,” Mr. Neuberger said. ####  ##### Gerald Frye, president of The Benefit Services Group Inc., an employee benefits consultant in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, said the rise of accountable care organizations under the federal health care reform law, the growth of health insurance exchanges and the emergence of new health-system partnerships in the state means “you're going to see dramatic purchasing pattern changes” as insurers offer new products and target different markets, and providers align to deliver value-based care. ####  ##### Quad's decision “is not abnormal at all” given the changing dynamics, Mr. Frye said. ####  ##### A. Michael La Penna, founder and a principal at Grand Rapids, Michigan-based health industry consultant The La Penna Group Inc., said if Anthem came along with better pricing, “it was because Quad set a standard that Anthem had to achieve.” ####  ##### But A.J. Lester, president of the Houston-based direct contracting consultant A.J. Lester & Associates Inc., questioned whether large managed care companies' discounts offset administrative fees and other costs of doing business with commercial insurers. ####  ##### Quad declined to discuss specifics of its deal with Anthem. ####  ##### Quad, which has about 25,000 employees at 70 facilities in North America, Europe and Latin America, dropped its rental network and direct contracts with providers outside of Wisconsin about four years ago and shifted to a national U.S. network with Anthem. ####  ##### The printing company also is growing by acquisition, including the May purchase of Waseca, Minnesota-based Brown Printing Co. and the February purchase of Woburn, Massachusetts-based UniGraphic Inc. ####  ##### “We're in 35 states now, so to go out and develop direct contracts is kind of impractical,” Mr. Neuberger said. ####  ##### He insists that Quad remains committed to maintaining a dialogue with quality medical providers in Wisconsin and, if possible, selectively contracting with them. ####  ##### “While we're getting out of the network contracting business, we're not getting out of the provider-employer relationships business,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Neuberger expects disruption of existing patient-provider relationships of no more than 1% to 2% since employees will have access to a broader provider network. ####  ##### Health plan members may continue to receive primary care through clinics operated by the company's QuadMed subsidiary, which still has outside clients. ####  ##### Quad's priority in the next year will be steering patients to high-value hospitals, specialists and other providers within Anthem's network, Mr. Neuberger said. #### "
"Labor, self-insurance group align on health care benefits","Benefits Management","Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### WASHINGTON — The Self-Insurance Institute of America Inc. plans to continue cooperating with organized labor in pursuit of common goals, according to the SIIA's president and CEO. ####  ##### The Simpsonville, South Carolina-based SIIA has traditionally worked with business organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Now “we're doing more outreach” to organized labor, said SIIA President and CEO Mike Ferguson. ####  ##### He noted that organized labor generally has better relations with Democratic lawmakers than business does during a panel discussion on defending the self-insurance industry at SIIA's annual conference in Washington last week. ####  ##### In an interview after the discussion, Mr. Ferguson said many union members are receiving health benefits under multiemployer Taft-Hartley plans that use stop-loss insurance. Some states, however, have targeted the use of stop-loss insurance by self-funded employers. Mr. Ferguson said that many of SIIA's members' are business partners of Taft-Hartley plans. ####  ##### A multiemployer plan is a collectively bargained plan maintained by more than one employer, usually within the same or related industries, and a labor union. These plans are often referred to as “Taft-Hartley plans.” ####  ##### “We're trying to demonstrate that this isn't just a private employer issue,” said Mr. Ferguson. “It's a broadening of our coalition.” ####  ##### “How often do you see business and labor line up on the same side?” he asked. ####  ##### “Stop-loss is crucial for protecting efficient, quality health care coverage for millions of workers and their families,” Edward Smith, president and CEO of Washington-based insurer Ullico Inc., which provides life and health insurance for unions and group plans, said in an email. “Working with the SIIA on this issue is a win-win — it strengthens the voices of union members whose health care coverage is protected by stop-loss.” ####  ##### During the panel discussion, Jerry Castelloe, chairman of the SIIA government relations committee, said numerous issues affecting self-insurance have arisen in the past few years. For example, he also noted that state regulators are showing considerable interest in regulating stop-loss insurance. ####  ##### On the federal level, SIIA has commented on so-called “Cadillac tax” health care regulations, he said. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act calls for imposing a 40% excise tax on the portion of premiums above $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage beginning in coverage year 2018. Mr. Castelloe said SIIA's comments have dealt with such questions as how a benefit potentially subject to the tax would be valued, what plans would be included and who would ultimately be responsible for paying the tax. ####  ##### Also on the federal level, SIIA is focusing on passing the Self-Insurance Protection Act, which has been introduced in both houses of Congress. The act would amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code to exclude coverage of certain medical stop-loss insurance obtained by sponsors of self-insured group health plans from the definition of health insurance. ####  ##### ERISA pre-empts states from mandating the content of self-funded benefit plans. In addition, self-funded benefit plans are exempt from many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### “We continue to have engagements with Congress,” said Mr. Castelloe, urging conference attendees to visit their members of Congress to discuss the measure. ####  ##### Bob Tierney, chairman of the Self-Insurance PAC board of trustees, picked up on the theme of the importance of personal contact with lawmakers. He said that when a group of SIIA members visits a lawmaker, it's important to have someone from that lawmaker's state in the room. ####  ##### “SIPAC gives SIIA the vehicle to strengthen its voice on the federal and state level,” said Mr. Tierney. “It's really where policy and politics meet.” He added that the political action committee has raised $40,000 this year and “we're likely to increase that.” ####  ##### John Eggertsen, an attorney with Eggertsen Consulting P.C. in Ann Arbor, Michigan, noted that there “really haven't been that many cases in the past couple of years” dealing with ERISA. ####  ##### But SIIA is involved in a case in which a federal appeals court decision upheld a Michigan law that imposes a 1% tax on paid health care claims. ####  ##### Under that law, revenue generated by the tax, which is used to help fund the state's Medicaid program, is paid by health insurers offering fully insured plans and by third-party claims administrators in the case of self-insured plans. ####  ##### SIIA argues that the tax is barred by an ERISA provision that pre-empts state and local laws and rules that relate to employee benefit plans and is seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the case. #### "
"Washington State lawmakers urge IRS to ease direct primary plan regulations","Benefits Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits"," ##### Lawmakers from the state of Washington are asking federal regulators to allow employers to offer direct primary care plans in conjunction with health savings account-qualified high-deductible health plans. ####  ##### Currently, employers can pair direct primary care plans, which are usually paid on a per-member-per-month basis and provide the full range of primary and preventive care services, only with HDHPs that do not have HSAs because DPC plans are considered “health plans” under Section 223(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits HSA account holders with HDHPs from having a second “health plan.” ####  ##### But the lawmakers maintain these arrangements should be treated as “qualified medical expenses,” under IRS rules governing HSAs to comply with provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act facilitating the creation of “direct primary care medical homes.” ####  ##### In a June 17 letter sent to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray and Rep. Jim McDermott, all Democrats representing the state of Washington, sought a ruling that payments made for DPC plans be treated as “qualified medical expenses” under IRS rules. ####  ##### “Direct primary care medical homes are not insurance,” states the letter, quoting from March 12, 2012, final regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services relating to the treatment of direct primary care medical homes in health insurance exchanges. ####  ##### “We understand that Section 223(c) of the Internal Revenue Code does prohibit HSA holders from having a second health plan,” the letter states. “However, it appears that the IRS has not updated policy to inform employers that DPC medical homes, as noted in the ACA, are not health plans.” ####  ##### “If you take a bronze plan, you can often pair that with a DPC plan on an exchange, and it would be perfectly compatible with the ACA mandates,” said Dr. Samir Qamar, CEO of MedLion, a privately held direct primary care provider based in Las Vegas, and a member of the Direct Primary Care Coalition, which is also lobbying Congress to enact changes to either the ACA or the U.S. tax code to allow employers to purchase DPC plans in conjunction with HSA-qualified HDHPs. However, under current IRS rules, HDHP plan members cannot also have an HSA under such pairing arrangements, he noted. ####  ##### “The letter is seeking to make DPC plans exempt from insurance regulations,” Dr. Qamar said, because “direct primary care is not insurance.” Such a change would also allow employees to use HSA funds to pay for DPC plans on a pretax basis, he said. #### "
"As millennials dominate the workforce, benefit focus shifts to student loans","Benefits Management","Voluntary Benefits"," ##### As millennials have become the majority in the U.S. workforce, some employers are trying to keep student debt from threatening the work environment by helping their millennial workers learn to balance loan payments with saving for the future. ####  ##### Student loan debt adds to financial stress that can plague employees' productivity and lead to health issues and higher medical costs for employers, experts say. It also makes it harder for workers to contribute to the company retirement plan, potentially delaying their retirement. ####  ##### “It's definitely an employer issue,” said Heather Tredup, Chicago-based partner of retirement communications at Aon Hewitt. “Employers spend a lot of money to provide benefits to their employees ... but when there is a barrier to saving, such as credit card (debt) or debt management, that means that employees may not be getting the full advantage of the benefit that is available to them.” ####  ##### Outstanding student loans total more than $1.2 trillion. About 70% of 2014 college graduates had student loan debt, with an average of $28,950 per borrower, according to the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success. ####  ##### The issue looks to grow, as millennials surpassed Generation X in the first quarter of this year to become the largest cohort in the U.S. workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. ####  ##### Still, only 3% of employers help pay their employees' student loan debt, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. ####  ##### Some employers are tackling the problem aggressively. ####  ##### New York-based professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. said in September that it will contribute $1,200 a year for up to six years toward employees' student loans. Others are helping employees refinance the loans or providing tuition subsidies to those in school. ####  ##### Sensing a lucrative market, benefit startups aimed at helping employers alleviate millennials' financial burdens are appearing. ####  ##### Gradifi Inc., a Boston-based firm partnering with PwC, helps employers make contributions toward workers' student loan debt, as does Santa Monica, California-based Tuition.io Inc. San Francisco-based startup Social Finance Inc. partners with employers to provide student loan refinancing to employees. ####  ##### But benefits experts say less expensive methods can be just as effective. ####  ##### Most often, employers offer financial education through videos, webinars and financial planner meetings to address issues millennials might face, such as budgeting, Ms. Tredup said. ####  ##### “The focus tends to be on how do you create a budget, how do you live within your budget, and if you're living beyond your budget — so maybe you're experiencing more debt issues today — how do you start to address those?” she said. ####  ##### At Armonk, New York-based IBM, employees are offered free one-on-one counseling on whatever financial issues they face. The subject “can range anywhere from your health care plan, looking at how much should I be contributing to my 401(k), what should my investment strategy look like in that plan, looking at student loan debt and consolidation,” said Kori Weber-Parker, Franklin, Wisconsin-based director of benefits at IBM. ####  ##### IBM also helps employees consolidate their student loans through a third party at a small discount, she said. “When you have a stressful environment at home, you then carry that in over to your work, and it does impact productivity,” Ms. Weber-Parker said. “So if we can help our employees relieve some of that stress around their financials and improve the financial wellness position of each employee, we feel that that will help them on the job.” ####  ##### The shift in focus to workers' current financial issues versus those of later years comes as employers and consultants realize millennials' sense of retirement can be very different than that of prior generations, Ms. Tredup said. ####  ##### An October study by personal finance firm NerdWallet Inc. pinpoints the retirement age of 2015 college graduates at 75 because of increasing student loan debt and rent. Today, the average retirement age is 62. ####  ##### For the baby boomers who are at or near retirement age, “we're finding that people aren't ready to retire, so they're staying on longer with their employer,” said Ted Goldman, managing director and U.S. retirement leader in the wealth practice at Buck Consultants at Xerox in Washington. ####  ##### That has come as many employers have replaced traditional pensions with defined contribution plans that put more responsibility on workers' shoulders. ####  ##### In those cases “the employer now has a workforce that's starting to bottle up opportunities for junior people,” Mr. Goldman said, and results “in higher health care costs because they have an older working population.” ####  ##### Buck Consultants has developed a tool that automatically enrolls workers in the company retirement plan at a contribution level based on factors such as the worker's age, salary and amount they have in their 401(k) account, Mr. Goldman said. ####  ##### “Doing that every year throughout your working lifetime, if you let it work, you will always be on a path toward a secure retirement,” he said. ####  ##### In addition to retirement, debt-saddled millennials are putting off other big purchases such as “buying a house (or) buying a car,” said Meghan Murphy, director of thought leadership at Fidelity Investments in Boston. ####  ##### So the investment firm advises workers to spend 50% of a paycheck on essential expenses, such as housing, food and health care, while saving 15% for retirement and 5% for an emergency fund. ####  ##### It's easier said than done, but millennials welcome help at work. According to an October study by Aon Hewitt, 46% of millennials said they want information on debt management from their employer. ####  ##### While millennials “know they should be saving” for the future, “what we often hear in conjunction with that, though, is the guilt of not being able to do it or not feeling like they're saving enough,” Ms. Murphy said. #### "
"Employers focus on health insurance plans providing better care and lower costs","Benefits Management","Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits"," ##### WASHINGTON — Employers and health insurers are pursuing fresh benefit plan designs and communication strategies aimed at reducing medical costs and improving overall health conditions among employees and their families. ####  ##### In 2016, Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp. plans to address the persistent issue of unnecessary and/or misinformed medical care and other types of systemic waste within its $1.25 billion health plan by implementing a “process-based plan design,” said Shawn Leavitt, Comcast's senior vice president of global benefits. ####  ##### “What we're saying is that it's our money, and we have a right and a responsibility to our employees to ensure that it's spent wisely,” Mr. Leavitt said earlier this month during a presentation at the 19th annual National Business Coalition on Health Conference in Washington. ####  ##### Consumerism by itself — at least as it is contemplated under many current high-deductible health plan designs — is unlikely to cut medical care costs or improve health outcomes, Mr. Leavitt said. Comcast is preparing a benefit plan design that couples value-based health care purchasing with independent third-party “personal shoppers” contracted to help employees and their families “receive the right care, in the right setting and at the right price from the right provider and at the right time,” he said ####  ##### “The concept is that rather than in-network or out-of-network, you're either in-process or out-of-process,” Mr. Leavitt said. “You're considered in-process if you're using the concierge services to make appointments for high-tech imaging, which ensures that you're being driven into high-quality, freestanding, lower-cost providers; or out-of-process if you're selecting it yourself and being reimbursed at a lower rate.” ####  ##### Mr. Leavitt said other examples of in-process utilization would likely include requests for additional medical opinions and cancer treatment plans that have been reviewed by top-rated specialist medical centers. ####  ##### “We're kind of giving up on the concept that narrowing the network is going to help, or that direct contracting is the big ticket. Potentially, it will involve reference pricing,” Mr. Leavitt said. “We can take one of these big, broad networks that everyone has and, through effective consumerism and the support and concierge services, we'll only use the parts of the network that actually work and are necessary.” ####  ##### Health insurers have also been investing time and resources to develop new programs and tools designed to improve the quality of both the medical care and health management communications employees and their families receive through their health benefit plans. ####  ##### Two years after rolling out its Member Centric Decision Management analytics and automated communications software platform in 2012, Chattanooga-based BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee Inc. estimates that the 36 clinical outreach campaigns it has launched using the platform have resulted in more than $1.5 million in averted medical costs by closing gaps in patient care and treatment regimens. ####  ##### The key to the platform's success is its capacity to work through a complex matrix of patients' previous claims, health risks, demographic and lifestyle information and communicate delivery preferences, said Lesia Stuart, director of predictive and accreditation analytics at BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, during a panel discussion at the NBCH conference. ####  ##### “When you marry all of those pieces of information together, you get a 360-degree view of the member,” Ms. Stuart said. ####  ##### Insurers also are developing programs that can help employers address their single biggest benefits communication challenge, according to survey data published earlier this month by the NBCH and San Francisco-based Benz Communications Inc.: driving higher levels of benefits engagement among employees and their families, particularly when it comes to health management and preventive care services. ####  ##### One such program is Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc.'s Habit Heroes, a multimedia collaboration between WellPoint, Marvel Worldwide Inc. and its parent company, The Walt Disney Co., designed to inspire healthier nutrition and exercise habits in children. ####  ##### “We worked with Disney and Marvel Comics to take a few basic psychological principals to develop within kids an internal sense of control over their behavior and choices,” said Davis Klaila, behavioral sciences director at WellPoint. ####  ##### The program, which consists of online and mobile-enabled videos, games and challenges, as well as a special edition comic book featuring popular Marvel characters, is free for all health insurance enrollees covered by WellPoint or one of its subsidiaries. ####  ##### “This is a primary intervention that can be done to help change behaviors, and it's something that every parent can do to help control health care costs,” Mr. Klaila said. #### "
"Employers moving post-65 retirees to private health insurance exchanges","Benefits Management","Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits"," ##### A growing number of employers that offer health insurance to post-65 retirees are turning to private exchanges since the health care reform law took effect to provide coverage on an individual basis, often at a lower cost than their group plans could. ####  ##### The percentage of employers with 200 or more employees offering retiree health coverage had dropped to 28% in 2013 from 66% in 1988, according to the 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust survey of employer-sponsored health benefits. ####  ##### And while about 29% of employers that offer post-65 retiree health benefits are using private health exchanges, 27% of employers are considering doing so in the future and 44% are evaluating changes, according to a survey of 424 private and public plan sponsors representing 3.8 million retirees, benefit consultant Aon Hewitt said in a study released in February. ####  ##### Drivers of the movement that grew further as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were the 2013 elimination of the tax-favored status of the retiree drug subsidy and improvements to the Medicare Part D program that will eliminate the so-called “donut hole” by 2020, according to the Aon Hewitt survey. ####  ##### “In the post-ACA market, individual coverage has been more cost-effective for retirees, all while preserving retiree benefit value,” said John Grosso, Norwalk, Connecticut-based actuary and leader of Aon Hewitt's retiree health care task force. ####  ##### “Most employers that provide group health benefits to post-65 retirees are at the very least evaluating whether an exchange would work for them and their retirees,” said Eric Stanger, principal of health exchange solutions at Buck Consultants at Xerox in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. “We're not looking at first movers anymore. The level of activity we're seeing from employers has increased almost exponentially every year.” ####  ##### Moreover, by using exchanges, “it caps the costs for employers if they move to a defined contribution approach” to fund the benefits, and “it gives the retirees the ability to customize their benefits to what they really need,” said Barbara Gniewek, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. “It also eliminates the burden of administration.” ####  ##### Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. moved its 17,000 nonunion post-65 retirees and spouses to Aon Hewitt's private exchange in 2012. ####  ##### Now, the retirees, depending on where they reside, can have nearly three dozen plans from which to choose to find one that best fits their health care needs. Previously, UPS had a “one-size-fits-all” medical plan with a deductible and coinsurance, but paid a subsidy to post-65 retirees to purchase Part D coverage on the individual market, said B.J. Dorfman, Atlanta-based director of U.S. benefits. ####  ##### “We had a lot of feedback before from our retirees that there wasn't much value to our existing plan,” Ms. Dorfman said. “It was secondary to Medicare and didn't pay unless they hit a $1,000 out-of-pocket maximum. So from a design standpoint, the fact that they could pick their own plan and they had more choice — it was really appealing to them.” ####  ##### To fund its post-65 retiree health benefits, UPS in 2015 will put $2,157 per plan member into a health reimbursement arrangement, which the retirees use to purchase exchange coverage. If they purchase a less costly plan, they can use the funds in their HRA to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses. ####  ##### “It was a cost-neutral solution. We saw it as a way to provide better value for the same cost,” Ms. Dorfman said. ####  ##### While UPS' decision kept its costs the same, the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association halved its costs by moving 1,300 post-65 retirees in 2013 to Extend Health Inc., a private exchange Towers Watson & Co. purchased in 2012. ####  ##### “We were paying $5 million in 2012 for the group plan,” said Kathy Foster, assistant CEO for the Oakland, California-based association. “We also had some retirees call us and ask why they could get an individual plan through AARP that was basically the same plan but half the cost.” ####  ##### By switching to individual coverage via the exchange, the association's costs dropped to $2.5 million and kept coverage levels the same while giving retirees more choice. ####  ##### “Our retirees are enrolled in 214 different plans with 55 different carriers,” Ms. Foster said. ####  ##### One reason the cost is often less for individual post-65 retiree coverage purchased on an exchange is the risk is spread more than for a single-employer plan, experts say. ####  ##### “Your retiree group typically is getting smaller, older and sicker. The individual market has baby boomers retiring into it, most of whom don't have employer coverage. This is a better risk group because it's relatively healthy,” said John Barkett, director of health policy affairs at Towers Watson in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Still, the change can be confusing for retirees, who have little or no experience in shopping for health insurance, experts say. But most private health exchanges have customer service representatives to help post-65 retirees through the process. ####  ##### “Hand-holding, communications, customer service is critical to employers that send their retirees to the private exchanges,” said David Embry, president of Lockton Marketplace, a private exchange platform offered by Kansas City, Missouri-based insurance broker Lockton Cos. L.L.C. that is powered by SelectQuote Insurance Services. ####  ##### When the Alameda County retiree group evaluated exchange options prior to selecting Extend Health, “one of our main goals was to make sure retirees had a good level of customer service,” said Ms. Foster. “Prior to that, retirees would contact my staff regularly. They liked to call us and have us fix their problems. Since we didn't have control over the plans they would be enrolled in, we wanted to make sure that they had that same level of service.” ####  ##### In fact, even after contracting with an exchange, “we still do Medicare transition seminars and provide assistance to those who need it,” Ms. Foster said. #### "
"Health savings accounts have helped moderate costs over the past 10 years","Benefits Management","Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits"," ##### A decade ago, annual double-digit group health care plan cost increases were the norm. ####  ##### In 2003, for example, costs shot up 10%, the third consecutive year of double-digit cost increases, leading many employers and others to ask whether it was possible to control health care costs. ####  ##### A decade later, a very different health care plan cost story is playing out. In 2013, group health care plan costs nudged up just over 2%, the lowest increase since 1997, according to consulting firm Mercer L.L.C. ####  ##### And this year's cost increase was not a one-year fluke. In 2012, costs rose just 4.1%. ####  ##### While there is no one reason why health care plan cost increases have come down so dramatically, many experts say a key reason has been the large-scale employer adoption and employee enrollment in a health care plan design that didn't even exist a decade ago: high-deductible plans linked to health savings accounts. ####  ##### It was 10 years ago last week that President George W. Bush signed legislation authorizing HSA-linked plans, effective in 2004. ####  ##### From that beginning, HSAs have grown to be a major health care plan design. At the start of 2013, more than 15 million individuals were enrolled in HSA-linked plans, a 50% increase in just three years, while the overwhelming majority of employers now offer HSA-linked plans. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We wanted employees to better understand the cost of health care,” said Ray Allsup, senior director of global benefits at Lam Research Corp. in Fremont, Calif. ####  ##### At a dinner sponsored by the National Center for Policy Analysis and held in Washington in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the HSA authorization legislation, a key congressional backer of the legislation reflected on the impact of HSAs on consumer behavior and use of health care services. ####  ##### “It was about giving people incentives to be cost-conscious. It was incentivizing the consumer to be cost-conscious,” said former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who spoke at the dinner. ####  ##### The design of HSA-linked plans was radically different from that of mainstream plans, such as health maintenance organizations, and their low employee cost sharing requirements. ####  ##### In 2004 — the first year that employers could offer the arrangement — HSAs had to be linked to health insurance plans with a minimum deductible of $1,000 for single coverage and $2,000 for family coverage. Those minimum deductibles — which currently, due to an indexing feature in the law, are $1,250 for single coverage and $2,500 for family coverage — were many times higher than the $100 or $200 deductibles that were the norm a decade ago. ####  ##### But offsetting that much higher exposure to picking up a portion, or even all, of a medical or hospital bill was the HSA feature. Employers and employees could contribute on a tax-favored basis — currently as much as $3,250 for those with single coverage and $6,450 for family coverage — to the HSAs. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Under the law, employees can use HSA funds to pay for health care expenses that are not covered, such as those falling under a deductible. Unused funds can be rolled over year after year to pay for succeeding years' expenses and can also be used to pay for retiree health care expenses on a tax-free basis. ####  ##### Those high deductibles — coupled with the account feature — have made employees far better consumers of health care services, experts say. ####  ##### “When you have to use your own money, you start to understand health care costs and you become more prudent in spending on health care services,” said Joseph Jackson, CEO of HSA administrator WageWorks Inc. in San Mateo, Calif. ####  ##### One HSA executive, Gregg Larson, senior vice president and managing director of health care consumerism for Xerox Corp.'s HR solutions unit. in Minneapolis, cites his own experiences in how participating in an HSA-linked plan has made him a better consumer of health care services. ####  ##### After his son was injured in a sporting event and taken to an emergency room, the doctor suggested an MRI. Mr. Larson would have had to pay the roughly $1,500 cost of the MRI out of pocket. So he asked if an MRI were really necessary, and the doctor acknowledged that an X-ray would be appropriate. ####  ##### “It was an appropriate question from a consumer,” said Mr. Larson, noting that the exposure to big deductibles makes individuals, like himself, ask more questions as they search for lower-cost but appropriate care. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Employees learn they can use fewer services and more cost-effective services. They learn they can go to an urgent care center rather than an emergency room,” said Michael Thompson, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### Asking questions in search of more cost-effective care has helped to make HSA-linked plans far less expensive than more traditional plan designs. ####  ##### For example, in 2013, HSA-linked plans cost an average of nearly $8,500 per employee, or about $1,700 less compared with traditional preferred provider organizations, according to a Mercer survey released last month. ####  ##### That cost difference is certain to trigger even greater employer adoption of HSA-linked plans in the years ahead, experts say. ####  ##### “You will see increased popularity in the next five to 10 years. We could get up to 50% enrollment,” said Todd Berkley, president of HSA Consulting Services L.L.C. in Minnetonka, Minn. ####  ##### Currently, according to Mercer, about 18% of employees are enrolled in HSA-linked plans, or plans linked to health reimbursement arrangements, which are somewhat similar to HSAs. ####  ##### “We have only seen the tip of the iceberg,” Mr. Thompson added. #### "
"JPMorgan wins dismissal of Madoff conspiracy suit","Risk Management",""," ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—A federal appeals court threw out a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase & Co. of violating U.S. racketeering law by conspiring with Bernard Madoff to further his Ponzi scheme. ####  ##### Thursday's decision in a case brought by a Florida partnership that invested with Mr. Madoff came less than two weeks after the trustee seeking money for Madoff victims separately filed an amended $19.9 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan, accusing it of enabling Mr. Madoff's fraud and ignoring red flags. ####  ##### The trustee, Irving Picard, is trying to use the same racketeering law to recover as much as $58.8 billion from dozens of European defendants in his largest Madoff lawsuit. ####  ##### In Thursday's decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected an allegation by MLSMK Investment Co. that JPMorgan violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by conspiring with Mr. Madoff to ""fleece"" customers, and failing to freeze his accounts. ####  ##### MLSMK, based in Palm Beach, Fla., said it lost its $12.8 million investment with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities L.L.C. when Mr. Madoff was arrested on Dec. 11, 2008. It sought to hold JPMorgan liable for conspiracy under RICO, which allows treble damages, by aiding and abetting Mr. Madoff's fraud. ####  ##### But Judge Robert Sack, writing for a three-judge panel, said a federal ban on civil RICO claims based on securities fraud also covers aiding and abetting claims. ####  ##### ""As the plaintiff concedes,"" he wrote, ""the purpose of the bar was to prevent litigants from using artful pleading to bootstrap securities fraud cases into RICO cases, with their threat of treble damages."" ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones had dismissed MLSMK's RICO claim on different grounds. The 2nd Circuit had on June 6 also upheld her dismissal of four New York state law claims. ####  ##### Appeal possible ####  ##### ""The circuit essentially said aiders and abetters of securities fraud have a free pass, because plaintiffs cannot sue them for securities fraud or RICO,"" Howard Kleinhendler, a partner at Wachtel & Masyr L.L.P. representing MLSMK, said in an interview. ""I don't think that's a correct result, or what Congress intended."" ####  ##### He said his client may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### Patricia Hynes, a partner at Allen & Overy representing JPMorgan, called the decision ""a very important ruling."" ####  ##### She said it resolved a split of opinion among judges in the 2nd Circuit, and makes clear that plaintiffs cannot do an ""end run"" around laws barring RICO claims based on securities fraud by presenting their claims differently. ####  ##### Mr. Picard filed his $58.8 billion lawsuit against dozens of defendants including Austria's Bank Medici A.G., its founder, Sonja Kohn, and Italy's UniCredit S.p.A. He alleged $19.6 billion of damages, which could be tripled under RICO. ####  ##### Thursday's decision ""could be problematic for the trustee"" in that case, Mr. Kleinhendler said. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for Mr. Picard had no immediate comment. A UniCredit lawyer declined to comment. ####  ##### Mr. Picard has filed roughly 1,050 lawsuits on behalf of Madoff victims to recover more than $103 billion. ####  ##### Mr. Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year prison sentence. ####  ##### The case is MLSMK Investment Co. vs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. et al., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-3040. #### "
"UBS sued over $900M Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac loss","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—UBS A.G. was sued by the conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which accused the Swiss bank of misleading the housing agencies into buying risky mortgage debt, resulting in more than $900 million of losses. ####  ##### The lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency is the latest effort by Washington to prop up the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), whose September 2008 federal seizure has so far cost taxpayers more than $135 billion. ####  ##### UBS spokesman Peter McKillop had no immediate comment. ####  ##### Other banks including Bank of America Corp. and its Countrywide unit have faced lawsuits by investors who claim to have lost money in mortgage-backed debt. ####  ##### According to the FHFA complaint filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lost more than 20% of their more than $4.5 billion investment in residential mortgage-backed securities sold by UBS in 16 securitizations between September 2005 and August 2007. ####  ##### The complaint said UBS hid or misstated the quality of the underlying loans and underwriting, and the ability of borrowers to make payments. ####  ##### Many of the loans were issued by lenders that later failed or went bankrupt, including American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., IndyMac Bancorp Inc. and New Century Financial Corp. ####  ##### According to the complaint, a review of 966 randomly chosen loans from two ""triple-A"" rated securitizations in 2006 and 2007 found that 78% were not underwritten properly. ####  ##### By May 2011, the complaint said, these securitizations were rated ""CCC"" by Standard & Poor's Corp. and ""Ca"" by Moody's Investors Service Inc., among the lowest junk grades. ####  ##### ""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not know of the untruths and omissions,"" the complaint said. ""If the GSEs would have known of those untruths and omissions, they would not have purchased the GSE certificates."" ####  ##### The lawsuit seeks to recoup Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's losses and undo the purchases, among other remedies. ####  ##### Republican lawmakers in Washington have been trying to reduce taxpayer support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and attract more private capital to the $10.6 trillion residential mortgage market.

Validus' offer is now valued at $44.575 per share, and Allied World's is valued at $43.58 per share. ####  ##### Berkshire said in an Aug. 5 letter to Transatlantic's president and CEO Robert Orlich that its offer is subject to a formal response no later than the close of business on Monday. ####  ##### Transatlantic said in a statement Sunday that its board “will carefully consider and evaluate the proposal from National Indemnity and will inform Transatlantic stockholders of the board's position.” It advised stockholders to await its recommendation. A company spokesman did not return phone calls. ####  ##### Berkshire offered $52 a share “under customary terms for a stock purchase agreement of a publicly traded company to be agreed (but not subject to any due diligence review or financing condition of any nature),” the letter said. ####  ##### In contrast, Allied World's offer was worth around $44.47 a share in intraday trading on Monday, while Validus' was around $45.88 a share. ####  ##### “Evidently Berkshire sees this as an attractive price for a well established reinsurer,” said Bruce Ballentine, an analyst in New York at Moody's Investor Services. “The pattern of Berkshire is to buy assets that seem undervalued.” ####  ##### If Transatlantic accepts the offer, Berkshire would get the company at 78% of book value, taking into account the $115 million break-up fee that Transatlantic agreed to pay Allied World in such an event. ####  ##### “It's amazing that they're comfortable doing this without due diligence, but I think at 78% of book value they have a good margin of safety,” said Paul Howard, director of research at Solstice Investment Research L.L.C. in Glastonbury, Conn. ####  ##### Berkshire's offer “validates Validus' theory that the commercial reinsurance space is likely to turn around for the positive sometime next year,” said Michael G. Paisan, a New York-based analyst for financial services firm Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Inc., which makes a market in the securities of Validus. ####  ##### Validus and Allied World fired back at Berkshire. ####  ##### Validus said in a statement Sunday that while its offer declined from $55.95 per share as of July 12, it still provides Transatlantic stockholders the opportunity to participate in the combined company's potential to improve its value in the future. ####  ##### Allied World had offered to give Transatlantic shareholders a 58% stake in the combined entity, while Validus had offered 48% ownership, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### “While the National Indemnity offer acknowledges the value of the Transatlantic franchise, it fails to provide Transatlantic stockholders with any participation in the upside of the combined company,” said Validus chairman and CEO Ed Noonan in the statement. ####  ##### Allied World's president and CEO Scott Carmilani said his offer allows shareholders to participate in the combined company's upside potential. “In contrast, National Indemnity's proposal is, at best, opportunistic and seeks to acquire Transatlantic for cash at a significant discount to book value, leaving Transatlantic shareholders no upside potential,” he said in a statement Sunday. ####  ##### Berkshire declined to comment. ####  ##### It's not the first time that Berkshire has joined into a bidding war involving Validus. After Validus made an unsolicited bid for IPC Holdings Ltd. in 2009,  Berkshire reportedly made an all-cash offer for the Bermudian property catastrophe reinsurer. But Validus ended up completing the deal in July 2009 for $1.65 billion cash and stock. #### "

"Appellate court reinstates case involving black New Haven, Conn., firefighter","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### NEW YORK—A federal appellate court reinstated a lawsuit brought by a black New Haven, Conn., firefighter over the same 2003 exam that was the focus of a U.S. Supreme Court case. ####  ##### In June 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court in Frank Ricci et al. vs. John DeStefano et al. ruled in favor of 17 firefighters—16 white and one Hispanic—who sued New Haven because the city rejected the 2003 captain and lieutenant's promotion exams out of fear it would be sued for discrimination by minority candidates. The majority held that Title VII prohibits intentional discrimination, or disparate treatment, as well as disparate impact, which are practices that are “facially neutral” but discriminatory in operation. ####  ##### Last month, those Connecticut firefighters accepted settlement offers from the city totaling about $2 million to end their case. ####  ##### New case can move forward ####  ##### In his 2009 suit, Michael Briscoe vs. City of New Haven, Mr. Briscoe argued he failed to win a promotion after the 2003 lieutenant exam because the test was weighted 60% for its written portion and 40% for its oral portion. The suit said the oral exam was a “better way to assess candidates' skills and abilities than the written test and had less disparate impact on African-Americans.” ####  ##### In its decision Monday, a panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Mr. Briscoe still could pursue his case despite the Ricci decision. The opinion stated that after careful review of that decision “and relevant nonparty preclusion and Title VII case law, we conclude that Briscoe's claim is neither precluded nor properly dismissed.” ####  ##### The Briscoe decision, however, which overturned a lower court ruling, added that while it was remanding the case for further proceedings, it expresses no view as to whether other issues, including relevant statutes of limitations, “may warrant dismissal of the action.” #### "
"Worker for subsidiary not employed by parent company: Appeals court ","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes"," ##### BOSTON—A worker for a subsidiary is not the parent company’s employee, despite an employee’s belief to the contrary, a federal appeals court ruled in dismissing the parent as a defendant in an employment discrimination case. ####  ##### According to Wednesday’s ruling in Caroline DeLia vs. Verizon Communications Inc. et al. by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the worker sued New York-based Verizon Communications Inc. and some of its subsidiaries, alleging she was sexually harassed by a co-worker and that her employer responded inadequately. ####  ##### Ms. DeLia worked as an artist for Idearc Media Corp., which was known for almost all of her 16-year employment as Verizon Directories Service-East Inc. Idearc was a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Directories Corp., which was a subsidiary of GTE Corp. and ultimately the parent company. ####  ##### Supervisor fired ####  ##### Ms. Delia, who alleged she was harassed for several months in 2005 by a supervisor, reported his behavior to Verizon’s equal employment opportunity personnel, who conducted interviews and made recommendations for corrective action. The supervisor eventually was fired after an incident involving a male employee. ####  ##### Ms. DeLia filed suit alleging a hostile work environment, sexual harassment and retaliation under state and federal employment laws. ####  ##### She provided evidence to support her contention that she was a Verizon employee, including stating she worked in Verizon’s Middleton, Mass., office and that her office key card bore Verizon’s logo. ####  ##### ‘Subjective belief’ ####  ##### However, Ms. “DeLia does not dispute that it was Idearc’s office, her own subjective belief notwithstanding,” a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled unanimously “Nor is the logo on the key card—indicating that the card itself is property of Verizon—probative of an employment relationship with Verizon.” ####  ##### The court also said that although it is undisputed that Verizon administered her benefits, “she was paid by Idearc, which maintained its own accounts, records and payroll, and which issued DeLia an annual W-2 form,” the court ruled. ####  ##### “We do not doubt that DeLia may have thought Verizon was her employer, but her subjective belief alone is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact,” the panel ruled in upholding a lower court’s ruling dismissing Verizon as a defendant in the case. #### "
"Catastrophe claim surge sends Amlin to first-half loss","Risk Management","Catastrophes, P/C Insurers"," ##### LONDON (Reuters)—Lloyd's of London insurer Amlin P.L.C. posted a £192.3 million ($316.7 million) pretax loss in the first half of 2011 as a result of a surge in claims from this year's Japanese earthquake and other natural disasters. ####  ##### However, Amlin said it hoped to recover from those losses and make a profit in the second half of the year, barring new major catastrophes or disasters, since it should benefit from rising reinsurance prices. ####  ##### “We do expect to make a second-half profit,” Chief Executive Charles Philipps said during a conference call. He declined to give any more specific second-half profit guidance. ####  ##### Amlin earlier this month already had warned of a loss of about £180 million, ($296.4 million) some 65 million ($107 million) more than analysts were expecting, because of a bigger-than-expected hit from the earthquake and a surprise jump in claims at Amlin Corporate Insurance, its European commercial insurance unit. ####  ##### Analysts have said the Aug. 2 profit warning dented Amlin's reputation for carefully controlling its exposure to major catastrophes. ####  ##### Its stock price has fallen about 20% over the past month. ####  ##### “We remain cautious on the stock, with an ‘underweight' recommendation,” JP Morgan Chase & Co. said in a research note. ####  ##### This year has already displaced 2005 as the costliest on record for natural disasters, with economic losses from catastrophes in the first six months alone totaling $265 billion, according to Munich Reinsurance Co. ####  ##### Amlin joined peers including Hiscox Ltd., Beazley P.L.C. and Catlin Group Ltd. in reporting steep first-half losses, weighed down by an unprecedented run of catastrophes including floods in Australia, earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, and tornadoes in the United States. ####  ##### Amlin said it was on track with its plans to improve the performance of the ACI division, formerly Fortis Corporate Insurance N.V., which it acquired in 2009. ####  ##### Amlin maintained its interim dividend at 7.2 pence (11.9 cents) per share. It said it remained confident on its long-term prospects and hoped to maintain its full-year dividend payout. ####  ##### “While our results are disappointing, the core underwriting businesses in London and Bermuda are well-placed to take advantage of an improving rating environment, particularly in catastrophe lines,” Mr. Philipps said. #### "

"SEC takes China-based Deloitte unit to court","Risk Management","Regulation, China"," ##### WASHINGTON (Reuters)—The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a U.S. federal court to force a Chinese unit of accounting giant Deloitte & Touche L.L.P. to produce records related to possible accounting fraud at Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd. ####  ##### The effort by the U.S. regulator to enforce a subpoena against Shanghai-based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd. underscores the difficulties American regulators face in probing U.S.-listed Chinese companies. ####  ##### The SEC and the FBI have been probing U.S.-listed Chinese companies and their auditors amid a rash of accounting scandals. ####  ##### Deloitte's China unit said it wished to co-operate with the SEC but that it is unable to give them the requested documents without approval from the Chinese regulatory authorities. ####  ##### ""We have passed on the SEC's requests to the regulators in China, as we are required to, but so far the China regulators have not given us permission to provide papers to the SEC,"" said Hong Kong-based company spokesman Wilfred Lee in an emailed statement. ####  ##### ""This is essentially a matter between regulators in China and the United States; Deloitte China is happy to comply with any outcome that is agreed between them,"" he added. ####  ##### The Deloitte unit abruptly resigned in May after uncovering ""numerous improprieties"" during its audit of the Chinese software company for the year ended March 31. ####  ##### The case could mark a major escalation in the diplomatic battle between the two countries to allow American regulators access to U.S.-listed Chinese firms, accounting experts said. ####  ##### ""This is the biggest thing that has happened in the transnational regulation of accounting in history,"" said Paul Gillis, visiting professor of accounting at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University. ####  ##### A failure by Deloitte to comply with the SEC order may lead to the loss of its registration with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Mr. Gillis said, a move that would have serious implications for U.S.-listed Chinese firms as other auditors might stop working for them. ####  ##### ""The nightmare scenario for a lot of people would be that the court directs the PCAOB to revoke Deloitte's registration,"" said Mr. Gillis. ####  ##### ""A lot of these U.S.-listed stocks have just become riskier because the listings of these companies may be in jeopardy if all these accounting firms have to bail out."" ####  ##### The SEC said Deloitte had argued it should not be required to produce documents that pre-date the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street oversight law, and that producing any documents could subject it to sanctions under Chinese law. ####  ##### ""This is a culture clash that the SEC is throwing to the courts to resolve,"" said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former senior counsel in the SEC's enforcement division and now a partner at Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy & Ecker P.A. ####  ##### The subpoena enforcement filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington marks the boldest move yet by the agency against a big accounting firm in its crackdown on fraud at Chinese companies that list on U.S. exchanges. ####  ##### Next month, U.S. and Chinese accounting watchdogs are due to meet in Washington for a second round of talks on joint inspections of auditing firms in China. ####  ##### The chairman of the U.S. PCAOB recently chided big accounting companies, saying they had a responsibility for the quality of audits conducted by their units in other countries. ####  ##### Jake Zamansky, an attorney who pursued investment banks after the dotcom crash on behalf of investors, predicted Deloitte would ultimately comply with the subpoena. ####  ##### ""Ultimately the SEC and PCAOB can take their license away. As long as it has the name Deloitte on it, they have a responsibility to adhere to U.S. laws,"" said Zamansky. ####  ##### That move though could be fraught with risks for Deloitte's standing with the Chinese authorities if it fails to win their blessing to hand over the documents before doing so. ####  ##### ""Deloitte really are between a rock and hard place here. If they don't comply it's a possibility they may lose their rights to do U.S. audits, if they do it's possible they will lose their right to do all audits (in China),"" said Peking University's Mr. Gillis. ####  ##### The SEC is seeking evidence to support its investigation into what it described as ""an apparently massive fraud on the domestic securities markets"" by Longtop, a Cayman Islands corporation with principal offices in China and Hong Kong. ####  ##### It said Deloitte had failed ""in every respect"" to comply with its subpoena. ####  ##### ""Compliance with an SEC subpoena is not an option, it is a legal obligation,"" said Robert Khuzami, the director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ####  ##### ""Subpoena recipients who refuse to comply should expect serious legal consequences."" ####  ##### Subpoena enforcements by the SEC are relatively rare, with the agency filing just 31 similar actions in the past five years. ####  ##### Prominent previous recipients of SEC subpoena enforcements have included Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and tobacco company RJ Reynolds. ####  ##### The SEC said the Deloitte documents may reveal how any fraud schemes were able to continue undetected for years at Longtop. ####  ##### It said the date of the Dodd-Frank law was irrelevant, and its interest in obtaining Deloitte's documents ""far outweigh China's secrecy interests."" ####  ##### Perrie Weiner, the international co-chair of the securities litigation practice at DLA Piper in Los Angeles, said the SEC is wading into untested territory as it tries to compel non-U.S. based companies to hand over documents. ####  ##### ""I think it's going to be a significant uphill battle to enforce subpoenas issued by U.S. courts in China,"" said Mr. Weiner. ""We have yet to see how this will play out."" ####  ##### Longtop's U.S. depositary shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after an initial public offering in 2007. ####  ##### In May, the NYSE halted trading in Longtop and delisted the company last month. At the time its shares were halted, Longtop had a market capitalization of $1.09 billion. ####  ##### Its shares now trade on the pink sheets and closed 17.7 percent lower at 28 cents on Thursday. ####  ##### Late last month, Longtop disclosed it had received a Wells notice from the SEC indicating it may face civil charges for accounting problems. ####  ##### U.S. officials are hoping China will agree to joint inspections of auditors, although they do not expect an agreement until sometime in 2012. ####  ##### ""This is a battle that I think is going to be fought in the headlines and with diplomacy and it's not going to be a battle that's going to turn on neat legal points in the courtroom,"" said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University. #### "

How does a 31-year-old rack up a $2.0 billion loss without anybody noticing?"" ####  ##### Others said the crisis showed lax supervision at UBS and threw the spotlight on an industry that will always compel some staff to take excessive risks to keep ahead of rivals. ####  ##### ""No rogue trader works in a vacuum, and UBS' management must have taken its eye off the ball to allow a trader to operate on this scale without sufficient supervision and without the systems to monitor his trades,"" said Simon Morris, a partner at U.K. law firm CMS Cameron McKenna. ####  ##### ""They, and the shareholders, must now pay the bill for this laxness."" ####  ##### Ms. Miskovic, who is based in Zurich and directly reports to Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel, had been head of risk at State Street from 2008 to 2010. From 1996-2002, she was chief risk officer at Lehman Brothers, the U.S. investment bank that collapsed three years ago Thursday. Before that she worked at Morgan Stanley. ####  ##### She replaced Philip Lofts, a UBS veteran who was promoted to head UBS Americas. ####  ##### UBS, which is struggling to regain investor confidence and rebuild its credibility after years of crises, warned it might post a loss in the third quarter after the latest blow threatening the future of its investment bank. #### "

The commission said in its order that the company “appears to have engaged in significant no-arm's-length transactions which may have been contrary to Ontario securities laws and the public interest.” ####  ##### It also said the company and certain officers and directors “appear to have misrepresented some of its revenue and/or exaggerated some of its timber holdings” by providing false or misleading information. In addition, it said, then-Chairman, CEO and Director Allen Chan appears to have engaged in fraud. ####  ##### Sino-Forest has raised about $3 billion from public investment and/or debt securities issues since 2003, including four public offerings between 2004 and 2009 that raised about $1.05 billion, according to the commission. ####  ##### Top executive resigns ####  ##### Two days after the commission's announcement, Sino-Forest announced that Mr. Chan had voluntarily resigned pending completion of an independent committee's review of the analyst's allegations. William Ardell, lead director and chairman of the independent committee, was named chairman; and Judson Martin, executive director and the company's vice chairman, was named CEO. The company said it also placed three employees on administrative leave. ####  ##### In its August announcement, Sino-Forest said that its business is complex, “the scope of the review is significant and there are enormous amounts of data that have been marshaled and are under review. In these circumstances, the independent committee has not yet reached any conclusions.” It said also it is cooperating with the commission. ####  ##### A company spokeswoman had no comment on the lawsuit. #### "

"U.S. agency accuses Cargill of discrimination, seeks to halt $60M in contracts","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation"," ##### SPRINGDALE, Ark.—The U.S Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has charged a unit of Cargill Inc. with discrimination and is seeking cancellation of its at least $60 million in government contracts. ####  ##### A spokesman for the targeted unit, Springdale, Ark.-based Cargill Meat Solutions, denied the federal agency's charges and said they are “unfounded and without merit.” ####  ##### The administrative complaint, which was filed Tuesday, alleges that Cargill Meat Solutions systematically discriminated against 4,069 qualified female, white, black, Hispanic and Native Americans who applied for entry-level production jobs at the facility. Cargill Meat Solutions is a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based Cargill. ####  ##### The federal agency said it has been unable to secure a fair resolution from Cargill to pay back wages and interest to the rejected job applicants and to extend job offers to at least 167of the affected workers. ####  ##### In addition to seeking cancellation of the at least $60 million in government contracts awarded to Cargill, the federal agency is seeking “debarment” of Cargill for future government contracts until Cargill resolves all violations and corrects its discriminatory employment practices. ####  ##### “This is an unfortunate case in which thousands of qualified workers were denied the opportunity to compete fairly for jobs in a tough economy,” OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu said in a statement. “Cargill has discriminated against vulnerable workers. OFCCP is prepared to use every tool at our disposal, including canceling a company's federal contracts when necessary, to achieve the goal of equal opportunity for workers.” ####  ##### The agency said it discovered the company's discriminatory practices during a scheduled review to determine its compliance with Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contactors from discriminating on the basis of race, national origin or sex when making hiring decisions. ####  ##### “The investigation found that the company's selection criteria were subjectively and inconsistently applied. As a result, women were less likely to be employed in entry-level production jobs, and Asian and Pacific Islander job seekers were unfairly favored over other racial groups,” the agency said in the statement. ####  ##### In a lengthy response, the Cargill Meat Solutions spokesman said in its statement, “We find the labor department’s allegations of discrimination to be disappointing given that Cargill’s employee population at Springdale, Ark., is diverse and is 84% minority. We believe the allegations are based solely upon statistical analysis and not based on an analysis of an individual hiring decision.” ####  ##### The statement said, “This situation feels like government-imposed hiring based on historical statistics and not reality.” ####  ##### The company said that from August 2005 to July 2008, the time frame cited by the government, jobs were plentiful in Springdale, Ark. “Cargill Meat Solutions complies with all federal regulations pertaining to hiring practices, including nondiscrimination and legal right to work in the U.S.” ####  ##### The company also said it “selects the best qualified candidates from open positions, without regard to their gender, race/ethnicity, nationality or any other nonjob-related category which complies with both the law and company policy.” ####  ##### Cargill also said the company “remains committed to treating all job applicants and employees fairly.” ####  ##### Cargill Meat Solutions processes turkeys for sale under the brand names Honeysuckle White and Riverside. ####  ##### Observers have said settlement of sex discrimination against units of Tyson Foods Inc., which was announced in September, reflects a more aggressive stance by the federal agency. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Comic book author says 'Cowboys & Aliens' was his idea","Risk Management",""," ##### A comic book author claims the producers of the 2011 sci-fi western “Cowboys & Aliens” stole the film’s concept from him more than 15 years before it was released. ####  ##### Steven John Busti, author of the “Bizarre Fantasy” series of comic books, first published his “Cowboys and Aliens” story in 1995, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in an Austin, Texas, federal district court. ####  ##### Mr. Busti’s comic book and the film tell a similar story about extraterrestrials invading the Old West and battling with a band of cowboys. ####  ##### Mr. Busti claims his story was previewed in a 1995 issue of Comic Shop News. Not coincidentally, he claims, an article about Malibu Studios and, more specifically, Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, one of the film’s producers, appeared on the same page. ####  ##### In May 1997, two years after Mr. Busti’s “Cowboys and Aliens” was published, Mr. Rosenberg and Platinum Studios Inc. produced a one-sheet pitch form “featuring a cowboy chased by an alien spaceship titled ‘Cowboys & Aliens,’ according to the suit. Based on that one-sheet, the suit claims Universal Studios and Dreamworks II Distribution Co. L.L.C. bought the film rights to Mr. Rosenberg’s “Cowboys & Aliens” from Platinum Studios. ####  ##### Several years later, in 2006, Mr. Rosenberg and Platinum Studios published their own “Cowboys & Aliens” graphic novel, which Mr. Busti claims bears several similarities to his work, “including an alien spaceship zooming overhead the main cowboy character, the spacecraft being discovered by Native American warriors (specifically Apache) who are then attacked. In addition, the alien commander in the defendants’ work is incredibly similar to the alien conqueror Morguu in Mr. Busti’s work.” ####  ##### Mr. Busti is suing the film’s production studios and its individual producers for copyright infringement, and is seeking damages and additional profits from the film’s DVD and Blu-Ray sales, but has not asked for an injunction barring the film’s distribution. #### "

"Japan's Olympus sues execs over scandal, shares surge on M&A hopes","Risk Management","Asia-Pacific & Australasia"," ##### TOKYO (Reuters)—Japan's disgraced Olympus Corp. is suing its president and 18 other executives, past and present, for up to $47 million in compensation as it struggles to recover from one of the nation's worst accounting scandals. ####  ##### The maker of cameras and medical equipment on Tuesday said all board members subject to the lawsuit would quit in March or April, leaving it in the extraordinary position for now of continuing with its most senior executive, Shuichi Takayama, and five other directors it is suing for mismanagement. ####  ##### One analyst likened the current board to condemned men, resigned to their fate, and said they would have difficulty over the next few months making any strategic decisions, leaving Olympus more vulnerable to an eventual takeover. ####  ##### ""Essentially, everyone feels they are on death row. It does seem extremely strange to have the death row cell inside the company,"" said Nicholas Smith, head of Japanese equity strategy at CLSA in Tokyo. ####  ##### ""Having nobody at the helm makes it easier for a takeover."" ####  ##### Olympus shares surged as much as 28% on the news, with investors betting the company's clean-up efforts would help it avoid a humiliating delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in turn helping to ensure it stayed on bidders' radars. The stock ended up 20%. ####  ##### Investors also looked forward to the eventual renewal of the board and to Olympus finally drawing a line under a $1.7 billion accounting fraud that has thrown a spotlight on Japan's reputation for weak corporate governance. ####  ##### Olympus has lost almost half its market value since the scandal erupted in October, when it fired its British boss, Michael Woodford—a rare foreign CEO in Japan—for questioning dodgy acquisition deals at the heart of the scandal. ####  ##### ""The plan is for the current board members who were found responsible and are subject to lawsuits to complete passing on their roles to avoid any impact on business implementation, and all resign at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting that is set to be held in March or April,"" Olympus said in a statement. ####  ##### Six of Olympus' 11 directors are being sued: five of its eight internal directors and one of three external directors. ####  ##### Mr. Woodford, who went public with his concerns after his sacking, said last week he was abandoning a bid to be reinstated to his old job, lashing out at big Japanese shareholders for their failure to back his bid. ####  ##### Also among those being sued by Olympus are former Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former Executive Vp Hisashi Mori and former internal auditor Hideo Yamada. ####  ##### An outside investigative panel found last month that this trio had played leading roles in a 13-year scheme to hide losses from Olympus investors. Former presidents Masatoshi Kishimoto and Toshiro Shimoyama were also included in the lawsuits. ####  ##### Olympus is seeking up to 3.6 billion yen ($47 million) in damages, with Messrs. Kikukawa, Mori and Yamada being targeted for the largest amounts. ####  ##### Mr. Shimoyama, who was president from 1984 to 1993, when the firm made many of the securities investments that later turned sour, declined comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit. ####  ##### Olympus said Mr. Takayama had no public comment at this point, and others could not be reached. ####  ##### Olympus' decision to sue follows a report by a separate panel appointed by the firm to look into who was to blame for the scandal. The panel said the 19 current and former executives bore various degrees of responsibility. ####  ##### ""Considering that the truth would have remained in the dark if Woodford had not raised doubts, we must have deep misgivings about the closed nature of Olympus' management to date and the weakness of its corporate governance, which allowed this situation,"" said this panel's report, released on Tuesday. ####  ##### Some big Japanese investors resisted Mr. Woodford's campaign to be reinstated. They said very little publicly, but investment bankers say they were uncomfortable with the Englishman's combative style and also his plans to recapitalize the company through private equity or a rights issue. ####  ##### Rights issues are unwieldy and rare in Japan, and private equity firms are often viewed as foreign asset strippers. ####  ##### Mr. Woodford reiterated on Tuesday that all the existing directors should go. ####  ##### ""If corporate governance is to mean anything in Japan and for those who care about the future of Olympus, the only way forward is an entirely new board of directors untainted by the past scandal,"" he told Reuters by email. ####  ##### Mr. Takayama, in a memo sent to employees on Tuesday and obtained by Reuters, said he and others who were set to resign at the shareholders' meeting would not be actively involved in nominating new directors or in drafting a new business plan. ####  ##### But he added that two internal teams formed to revitalize Olympus and improve its corporate governance—he heads both—would continue to draft proposals for the meeting, though these would first be vetted by outside experts on management reform. ####  ##### Olympus remains under joint investigation by Japanese police, prosecutors and regulators, and that probe could eventually result in criminal charges, although experts have said the firm itself is unlikely to be targeted. ####  ##### British and U.S. authorities are also investigating the affair, which has tarnished the reputation of the once-proud 92-year-old firm and has also stirred calls for reform of Japan's corporate governance regime. ####  ##### Sources told Reuters on Monday that the Tokyo Stock Exchange was likely to keep Olympus listed under a ""security on alert"" designation, which would effectively enable it to remain traded provided it showed steady improvement in its internal controls. ####  ##### The exchange said on Tuesday it had reached no decision. ####  ##### ""Investors are welcoming the move that Olympus shares will remain listed,"" said Ryosuke Okazaki, a director at ITC Investment Partners Corp. ####  ##### ""Investors who have been holding short positions are buying them back heavily. Also investors may be allocating funds into Olympus due to expectations the company will have a new governance. ####  ##### ""As Olympus shares are likely to remain listed, investors are eyeing the company as an M&A target. In this kind of mood, the shares are being bought back heavily,"" Mr. Okazaki added. ####  ##### Olympus needs fresh capital after the accounting fraud, with its accounts recently restated to show it is highly leveraged. ####  ##### Among firms rumored to be potential buyers or partners in a new capital tie-up with Olympus are Fujifilm Holdings Corp., Hoya Corp., Panasonic Corp. and Sony Corp. #### "

"OFF BEAT: Beer pong player can't sue bar for injuries","Risk Management",""," ##### A would-be beer pong champ has lost a court battle against the bar that served him alcohol before he was struck by a car. ####  ##### Alan Berger was playing beer pong with friends at Wicked Willy’s in New York in June 2009. ####  ##### The drinking game typically requires players to toss ping pong balls into an opposing player’s cup of beer. If the ball lands in a cup, the opposing player must drink the beer as quickly as possible. ####  ##### According to court records, Wicked Willy’s has designated beer pong tables, but it does not monitor the beer consumption of game players. An attorney for Mr. Berger said his client was “winning” the game before he left the bar, the New York Daily News reported. ####  ##### Mr. Berger, then 22 years old, was ""extremely intoxicated"" when he boarded a commuter bus to New Jersey that night, court records show. Hours later, he was hit by a vehicle while attempting to walk across a New Jersey highway. ####  ##### Mr. Berger sued Wicked Willy’s for his injuries last year. He alleged that the bar was negligent in its failure to stop serving him alcohol, among other claims. ####  ##### But the New York Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Berger's suit this month. Judge Lucy Billings said Wicked Willy's was not responsible for Mr. Berger's accident injuries, despite providing alcohol and supplies for beer pong. ####  ##### ""Plaintiff voluntarily engaged in the drinking game facilitated by defendant's furnishings and consumed alcohol to the point of diminished capacity,"" the ruling reads. ""New York law recognizes no duty on defendant's part to warn patrons regarding the risks of engaging in the drinking activity defendant made available or to make it safer by stopping or monitoring its participants."" #### "

"Lawsuit over allegedly stolen Twitter followers can proceed: Court","Risk Management",""," ##### SAN FRANCISCO—A South Carolina media company's lawsuit against a former employee over allegedly stolen Twitter followers can proceed to trial, a federal judge ruled Monday. ####  ##### Mount Pleasant, S.C.-based Phonedog L.L.C., an online publisher of consumer electronics reviews, claims a former California-based writer for the website, Noah Kravitz, stole more than 17,000 Twitter followers from the company when he resigned in 2010, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco in July. ####  ##### When he resigned in October 2010, PhoneDog claims it asked Mr. Kravitz to turn over access to the Twitter account he had maintained on behalf of the company. Instead, Mr. Kravitz allegedly changed the account's online handle from a company-branded name to a personal one and continued using the account—initially to supplement his freelance writing, and later as full-time writer for a competing website. ####  ##### In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, attorneys for Mr. Kravitz argued that PhoneDog had not been able to establish that Mr. Kravitz's conduct directly disrupted economic relationships between the company and the Twitter followers, its advertisers or other media outlets. ####  ##### U.S. Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James on Monday rejected Mr. Kravitz’ motion, noting that the company had demonstrated that the decrease in traffic to its website generated by the loss of the Twitter followers would reasonably impact the company’s ability to sell ad space on its site. ####  ##### “Based on these factual allegations, the Court is able to draw the reasonable inference that PhoneDog had an economic relationship with at least one third-party advertiser that was disrupted by Kravitz’s alleged conduct, causing it economic harm,” Judge James wrote in her decision. ####  ##### In its suit, PhoneDog claims the Twitter followers are the legal equivalent of a client list, which would ordinarily be treated as protected and proprietary information. ####  ##### Using industry standards, PhoneDog estimates the value of the lost Twitter followers at $42,500 per month, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### The company is seeking $340,000 from Mr. Kravitz to make up for the eight months of lost access that had accrued by the time of the lawsuit’s filing. #### "

"Former safety Dave Duerson's family sues NFL over his death","Risk Management","Workers Comp Coverage"," ##### CHICAGO—The family of former National Football League player Dave Duerson filed suit against the National Football League on Thursday, alleging the league's concealment of information about concussion risks and failure to take adequate steps to address brain injuries led to brain damage that contributed to Mr. Duerson's suicide last year. ####  ##### The suit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also names football helmet manufacturer Riddell Inc. ####  ##### The suit says Mr. Duerson suffered at least three concussions during his 11-year NFL career, and that examination of his brain at Boston University following his death indicated he suffered from progressive, advanced brain damage known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. ####  ##### The former Pro Bowl safety died in February 2011 after shooting himself in the chest. ####  ##### “If the NFL would have taken the necessary steps to oversee and protect Dave Duerson by warning him of the dangers of head traumas, and educating and training all persons involved with the NFL teams in the recognition, prevention and treatment of concussive brain injuries, then Dave Duerson would not have suffered dangerous repetitive head trauma, would have recovered more rapidly and would not have sustained permanent damage to his brain which contributed to his death,” the suit said. ####  ##### The Duerson family's suit is the latest in a growing number of concussion-related suits filed against the NFL and helmet makers by former players and their families. ####  ##### “(Until) recent times, (the NFL) took the position publicly that there was no relationship between football-related concussions and brain damage,” said Thomas Demetrio, a partner with the Corboy & Demetrio P.C. law firm in Chicago, who is representing the Duerson family in the case. “So it’s more than not educating these players. It’s supplying false information.” ####  ##### “I have a great deal of respect for the fact that prior to dying, (Duerson) told everyone close to him, pled with them, left notes for them…to get his brain to Boston University,” Mr. Demetrio said. “The family is carrying on what they knew their father wanted.” ####  ##### Mr. Demetrio said the extent of damages would be determined during a requested trial. ####  ##### Asked about the suit, an NFL spokesman said by email, “We have not seen the lawsuit and therefore our attorneys have not had an opportunity to review it. Dave Duerson was an outstanding football player and citizen who made so many positive contributions, but unfortunately encountered serious personal challenges later in his life.

"Brazil Chevron oil leak charges to focus on safety","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Latin America, Energy"," ##### RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters)—A Brazilian prosecutor plans to allege this week that Chevron Corp. and Transocean Ltd. should not have drilled a deep-water well that leaked in November, legal documents showed, giving a glimpse into expected criminal charges that could slow the rush to develop Brazil's vast offshore oil wealth. ####  ##### The allegations are part of police and prosecutors' reports being used to assemble criminal indictments against U.S. oil company Chevron, drill-rig operator Transocean, and 17 of their executives and employees. ####  ##### The documents, obtained by Reuters, provided the most detailed look yet at possible causes of the oil leak off Brazil's southern coast. They also outline why prosecutors are seeking criminal charges for what industry watchers note is a relatively small spill at a well that was approved for drilling by Brazilian regulators. ####  ##### ""We are in uncharted territory,"" said Cleveland Jones, a Brazilian oil geologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. ""Do we want better environmental standards? Yes. Did the environment get really hurt? No. If you applied the same standards to the whole industry, you'd probably have to shut it down, and we aren't applying the same standards to others."" ####  ##### Authorities on Saturday ordered Chevron's Brazil chief, George Buck, and 16 others to surrender their passports and remain in the country. Criminal charges could be filed by Wednesday, a spokesman for the prosecutor said. A Brazilian judge will then determine whether to proceed with formal indictments. ####  ##### The pending criminal case, along with a record $11 billion environmental lawsuit the prosecutor launched against Chevron in November, show heightened concern over the safety of Brazil's offshore oil boom in the wake of the 2010 BP P.L.C. oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. ####  ##### The Chevron leak was less than 0.1% of BP's massive spill, and no oil reached shore, raising concern from Chevron and others that the charges may be politically motivated or unfair. ####  ##### Much larger and more damaging spills by Brazilian state-run energy giant Petrobras, which owns 30% of the Frade field operated by Chevron where the leak happened, have not led to criminal charges against Petrobras or its executives. ####  ##### Chevron, which says it followed accepted industry practice, sought and received permission last week to shut down production at Frade after finding small, unexplained new leaks in the field that had been producing 61,500 barrels a day. That was down from about 80,000 bpd before the November spill. ####  ##### Prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira told Reuters in January he was merely trying to enforce the law and prevent future spills. ####  ##### A Chevron spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the prosecutor's documents. A Transocean spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the documents. On Saturday, the company said it ""has always cooperated with the authorities and will also continue to vigorously defend its people."" ####  ##### If the charges are filed as expected, the companies and officials probably face years of legal action. Lawyers have had travel bans lifted while similar cases were being litigated, and few individuals or companies have ever been convicted of environmental crimes in Brazil and fewer have gone to jail. ####  ##### Reuters reported Jan. 26 that Santos de Oliveira was preparing charges. The planned indictments were based in part on an investigation by Fabio Scliar, head of the Brazilian Federal Police's Environmental Division in Rio. ####  ##### The well that led to the November leak ""should not have been drilled,"" the report signed by Mr. Scliar says. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### When Chevron drilled into an undersea reservoir, high-pressure oil was able to ""kick"" and surge into the well. ####  ##### A safety valve on the sea floor prevented the oil from shooting up to the Transocean drill rig on the surface, which would have caused a gusher. Failure at such a valve, known as a blow-out preventer, or BOP, led to the BP disaster. ####  ##### The blow-out preventer trapped the kick pressure in the well, cracking the bare rock of the well bore hundreds of meters below the seabed. Oil seeped through the breech into porous rock and cracks then migrated to the sea floor and up to the surface. ####  ##### This should not have surprised Chevron, Mr. Scliar's report said. ####  ##### Chevron's drilling policies and environmental licensing documents required it to use a substance known as drilling mud at pressures sufficient to ""overbalance"" reservoir pressure kicks. Mud removes debris upward and holds oil down during drilling. ####  ##### In the 18 previous wells drilled in Frade, maximum reservoir pressure was between 8.4 and 8.6 pounds per gallon, Mr. Scliar said, citing interrogations of Chevron and Transocean officials. ####  ##### Those wells used mud at pressure of 9.2 pounds per gallon, giving the company a 0.4 to 0.6 pounds per gallon ""mud window,"" or safety margin, the police report alleges. ####  ##### In the well that leaked in November, Chevron expected maximum pressure of 9.4 pounds per gallon and used mud with 9.5 pounds per gallon of pressure, the report said. ####  ##### This provided a mud window or overbalance of only 0.1 pound per gallon, a safety margin only a quarter to a sixth of those used in the previous wells, Mr. Scliar said in the report. ####  ##### Mr. Scliar alleged that this shows Chevron knew the pressure was higher than normal, and used mud with less protection. ####  ##### Chevron used the lower safety margin in the last well because heavier mud might have exerted enough pressure to crack the well bore on its own, according to the report. This, Mr. Scliar alleged, shows Chevron was aware of the higher pressure and weaker-than-normal rock but drilled anyway. ####  ##### Buck said Nov. 24 that Chevron acted responsibly. The cracking of the well wall was an unfortunate miscalculation of reservoir pressure and rock strength, a not-uncommon occurrence in a business that works in places inaccessible to humans and beneath thousands of meters of ocean and rock. ####  ##### Paul Bommer, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Chevron faced a ""classic well-design problem."" ####  ##### ""Normally what happens when the mud window gets this close is people will think of stopping and cementing the well to strengthen it,"" he said. ""This is an area where you have to be very careful."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Cementing would have reinforced the bare rock of the well bore against the pressure from the kick and might have prevented the leak, but it would have cost money and time, Mr. Bommer said. ####  ##### Chevron's environmental licenses say the company is supposed to store liquids that can close a problem well aboard platforms. ####  ##### Buck has said it took four days to get mud heavy enough to kill the well from shore because storms made work dangerous. ####  ##### Some say Chevron is not the only one to blame for the leak. Petrobras and Japanese group Frade Japan are minority partners in the field, and Brazil's government approved drilling plans. ####  ##### ""I wouldn't be surprised if Chevron is found to have done a bad job,"" said Ildo Sauer, an oil and gas expert at the University of São Paulo and Petrobras' former natural gas chief. ""But Chevron got approval for its work at every step. It's a farce to attack on Chevron and let the government, with its bigger responsibility, off the hook."" #### "

"Barge company ordered to pay $4.3M to crewman forced to work in Hurricane Katrina","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Disability"," ##### EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.—A federal district court judge has told a barge company that ordered its crew to stay on board its Mississippi River towboat during the height of Hurricane Katrina to pay $4.3 million to a crew member. ####  ##### Judge David Herndon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois in East St. Louis, Ill., agreed with the plaintiff in Tyree R. Webb vs. TECO Barge Line Inc. that Mr. Webb had suffered possibly permanent post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of his three-day ordeal. ####  ##### According to Judge Herndon's 73-page decision—issued March 7 after a September 2011 bench trial—as Katrina approached on August, 29, 2005, Mr. Webb was on board the tugboat M/V Anita M, a 170-foot-long inland river towboat, on the Mississippi River near Davant, La. He and other towboat crew members were ordered to stay for the hurricane's duration by an executive of Metropolis, Ill.-based TECO, since renamed U.S. United Barge Line L.L.C. ####  ##### During eight hours of battering by the storm, the M/V Anita M suffered significant damage and required emergency pumps to be set up in order to avoid sinking. ####  ##### The M/V Anita M and another towboat “broke loose from their moorings and were driven by the hurricane onto the land on the opposite bank of the river, approximately one-quarter of a mile upriver and approximately one-half mile west from where they had originally been moored,” according to the decision. After running aground, both vessels “were battered by numerous barges and other objects during the remainder of the storm.” ####  ##### The towboats “were unseaworthy in that they were not reasonably fit to withstand the hurricane to which defendant chose to expose them,” said the ruling. “The court finds that the hurricane posed a very real threat to the lives of the crew members, including plaintiff.” ####  ##### Mr. Webb, who has divorced since the incident and has not returned to work, is constantly fatigued, has difficulty concentrating, is reclusive, has been suicidal and takes five psychiatric drugs, according to the decision. ####  ##### The court found a doctor's conclusion that Mr. Webb's post-traumatic stress disorder “is permanent and disabling to be persuasive and supported by the vast majority of the evidence,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The decision notes that according to the American Psychiatric Assn.'s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, “human design” is “one of the stressors that makes post-traumatic stress disorder longer lasting.” ####  ##### “Although Webb was exposed to a natural disaster, this was because his boss required it. The case therefore presents the human tormentor element present in rape and torture cases as well as the natural disaster feature,” said the judge in awarding Mr. Webb the $4.3 million, which he said is a “direct result of Hurricane Katrina and defendant's negligence.” ####  ##### U.S. United Barge Line's attorney could not be reached for comment. #### "

The state will use the money to address housing issues, such as mortgage defaults and foreclosures and further investigation and prosecutions. ####  ##### Citigroup, JPMorgan and Ally declined to comment on the settlement, while spokespeople at the other two banks were not immediately available. ####  ##### Other allegations in the New York lawsuit have not been resolved, and the state said it will still pursue claims for damages incurred by New York borrowers and homeowners. ####  ##### ""We intend to aggressively litigate this case to finally prohibit the widespread illegal and deceptive practices of the banks set forth in our complaint,"" Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said in an email on Tuesday. ####  ##### ""The significant sum of $25 million obtained by this office does absolutely nothing to limit the aggressive posture we will continue to take to protect homeowners and borrowers."" ####  ##### The lawsuit said the use of MERS resulted in the filing of improper New York foreclosures and created ""confusion and uncertainty"" over property ownership interests. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### More than 70 million mortgage loans, including millions of subprime loans, have been registered in the MERS system, rather than in local county clerks' offices, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### Nearly 11 million Americans owe more on their homes than they are worth, after home values fell 33% from a 2006 peak fueled by generous loans, often to people with dubious credit records. ####  ##### The earlier $25 billion housing settlement gives President Barack Obama, as he seeks re-election in November, a chance to show he is willing to get tough with big banks to help ordinary Americans survive the pain of the nation's foreclosure crisis. ####  ##### The deal, to be spread out over three years, requires the banks to cut mortgage debt amounts and extend $2,000 payments to borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure. ####  ##### But the banks still face a host of other potential government enforcement actions and investor lawsuits related to their packaging of home loans into securities, and other mortgage-related activities. ####  ##### In January, President Obama announced the creation of a new working group to coordinate inquiries into abusive home-loan lending and the pooling of risky mortgages that sparked the housing crisis. Mr. Schneiderman was tapped to help lead the group. #### "

"Ernst & Young pays $120M to end Swiss legal saga","Risk Management","Switzerland"," ##### ZURICH (Reuters)—Big-four audit firm Ernst & Young has agreed to pay 110 million Swiss francs ($120.1 million) to end a long-running legal dispute over its auditing of Banque Cantonal de Geneve, which had to be bailed out by the state. ####  ##### The payment, which will be made to the State of Geneva, BCGE and the City of Geneva, is the largest amount ever paid by an audit company in Switzerland to settle a legal wrangle, and is the audit company's maximum insurance coverage. ####  ##### ""This agreement is an important stage in the gradual resolution of a series of conflicts born from the management of the bank in the 1990s,"" said BCGE in a statement. ####  ##### To allow the payment, attorney general Daniel Zappeli withdrew his appeal against the acquittal in an earlier case of the two former Ernst & Young auditors charged over their auditing of the bank. ####  ##### The audit firm said all civil litigation relating to the BCGE case had been settled without any admission of liability from Ernst & Young. ####  ##### ""The parties have reached a mutual agreement allowing them to conclude this dispute, putting an end to litigation in relation to matters that occurred more than 15 years ago. Ernst & Young can now put this long-standing matter behind us,"" the group said. ####  ##### BCGE was bailed out in 2000 by the state, its majority shareholder which set aside 2.7 billion francs ($2.95 billion) to cover bad loans, after the bank accumulated 6.6 billion francs in problem debt from property-backed lending. ####  ##### In 2003, Geneva authorities launched a civil lawsuit demanding 3 billion francs ($3.28 billion) from Ernst & Young's Swiss arm after an analysis of BCGE losses allegedly showed several lapses by the audit firm, including the certification of false accounts. ####  ##### ""This agreement resolves several reciprocal complaints and allows the bank to record an extraordinary profit of 22 million Swiss francs ($24.0 million) due to the waiver of claims against Ernst & Young,"" BCGE said. #### "
"Suit alleges Avon paid to keep official quiet in bribery probe","Risk Management","China"," ##### WASHINGTON (Reuters)—An amended lawsuit filed by shareholders of Avon Products Inc. alleges a former head of internal audit threatened to provide securities regulators with evidence of bribery at the cosmetics seller, but then extracted a larger severance package in 2006 in exchange for his silence. ####  ##### The former global internal audit director, Fabian LaPresa, threatened to turn over to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a draft internal report prepared by an Avon auditor that allegedly showed executives paid bribes to Chinese government officials as the company sought permission to sell products door-to-door, the lawsuit said. ####  ##### An Avon spokeswoman declined to comment on pending litigation. Mr. LaPresa could not be reached for comment. ####  ##### The lawsuit said the extra benefits allegedly provided to Mr. LaPresa for his silence could only have been approved by the company's former finance chief, Charles Cramb, suggesting Mr. Cramb also knew of the internal report as early as 2006. ####  ##### Mr. Cramb did not respond to a request for comment submitted through Avon. ####  ##### Avon had planned to terminate Mr. LaPresa for misusing his expense account and provide him the standard severance of three months of salary and benefits, the lawsuit said. ####  ##### But after Mr. LaPresa told his supervisor he would disclose information from the draft audit report if Avon didn't provide him with extra benefits, he was able to negotiate his severance to one year of salary and health insurance, the suit said. ####  ##### The alleged circumstances surrounding Mr. LaPresa's departure were disclosed in the amended lawsuit filed Friday by two German investment funds, LBBW Asset Management Investmentgesellschaft mbH and SGSS Deutschland Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH, on behalf of other Avon shareholders. ####  ##### The shareholders are seeking compensation for losses suffered from Avon's share price decline from highs above $40 a share in 2008. The stock is currently trading at $18.70. ####  ##### Gregg Levin, a partner with Motley Rice L.L.C., which represents the shareholders, declined to provide more details about the alleged threat from Mr. LaPresa and the terms of his departure from Avon. ####  ##### Even before Mr. LaPresa's alleged role came to light, the 2005 internal report had caught the attention of federal prosecutors, Reuters reported last month. ####  ##### Prosecutors are investigating whether there was an effort at Avon headquarters to take any action based on the report, which flagged concerns about the cosmetics seller's compliance with U.S. anti-bribery laws, or if company executives ignored or tried to bury it, two people familiar with the matter said. ####  ##### Avon in 2006 won the first-ever license given by China to a Western company to sell products door-to-door. At the time it was seen as a major coup by Chief Executive Andrea Jung. ####  ##### But in 2008, the company disclosed it had opened an internal inquiry into whether its China business had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. firms and others from paying bribes to officials of foreign governments. ####  ##### The Securities and Exchange Commission is also probing Avon's China activities for potential violations of the FCPA, which requires companies to keep accurate books and records. ####  ##### Ms. Jung has agreed to step down once Avon finds a new CEO, but she will stay on as executive chairman. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Motley Rice, the South Carolina law firm that filed the amended complaint, made its name suing asbestos and tobacco companies and is one of the largest plaintiff litigators in the United States. ####  ##### In the amended lawsuit, which updates an original lawsuit filed last year, the plaintiffs say their investigator interviewed Chinese government officials who ""confirmed"" details of the payments. ####  ##### The lawsuit said the four officials were all from different Chinese agencies. It said two of the officials were beneficiaries of ""unlawful payments."" ####  ##### The officials, according to the lawsuit, alleged that Avon executives paid third parties ""substantial sums"" to schedule meetings between Ms. Jung and high-level Chinese government ministers; they ""repeatedly"" treated Chinese licensing officials to dinner and karaoke; and they paid Chinese government officials to attend Avon press conferences. ####  ##### The officials interviewed also said the payments were made specifically in support of Avon's application for a direct sales license. ####  ##### The investigator did not provide the names or titles of the officials to the lawyers for fear of prosecution, but the investigator agreed to sign a sworn affidavit attesting to their identity. ####  ##### A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. LaPresa worked at Avon between 2004 and 2006, and previously worked in audit departments at PepsiCo Inc., Altria Corporate Services Inc., and Diesel S.p.A.

"BizJet to pay $11.8M fine for bribing Latin American officials","Risk Management","Latin America, Political Risk"," ##### WASHINGTON—An Oklahoma-based aircraft maintenance company has agreed to pay nearly $12 million in fines for bribing Latin American government officials to secure maintenance contracts, according to a statement released last week by the U.S. Department of Justice. ####  ##### BizJet International Sales & Support Inc., based in Tulsa, Okla., will pay $11.8 million in criminal penalties for violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The department noted that BizJet's fine could have been more than double the agreed-upon amount had the company not voluntarily reported the bribes and stepped up its compliance efforts after the discovery. ####  ##### For in-depth coverage of this topic and related issues, visit the Business Insurance Solution Arc on  A World of Risk: Managing Foreign Bribery and Corruption Exposures. ####  ##### According to court documents, BizJet executives paid approximately $386,000 in cash and gifts between 2004 and 2010 to high-ranking officials of the Mexican Federal Police, the Mexican Presidential Fleet and the Panama Aviation Authority in exchange for maintenance contracts with those agencies. ####  ##### The payments were made either directly to officials working for the agencies or funneling payments through a nonexistent company run by a BizJet sales manager, the Justice Department said in the statement released last week. ####  ##### Under the terms of a three-year deferred settlement agreement filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on Wednesday, BizJet admitted responsibility for the violations, and agreed to cooperate with any ongoing or future DOJ investigations and periodically report to the department regarding its compliance efforts. The charge against BizJet could be dismissed at the end of the three-year term if the department is satisfied with the company's performance, court documents said. ####  ##### The DOJ also agreed to forgo prosecution of BizJet's indirect parent company, Hamburg, Germany-based Lufthansa Technik A.G., in exchange for the company's promise to cooperate with future investigations and implement strict internal controls. ####  ##### In court documents, the DOJ commended BizJet and Lufthansa for their “extraordinary cooperation,” including their internal investigations and voluntary disclosure of the FCPA violations. The department said the company’s cooperation was a primary consideration in reducing BizJet’s fine for the violations, which carry a potential penalty of more than $34 million. ####  ##### The department also highlighted the companies’ efforts to enhance its FCPA compliance after it discovered the bribes, including BizJet’s firing of the executives responsible for the malfeasance, enhanced due diligence for third-party business partners, and closer review of proposals and other transactional documents. ####  ##### “BizJet and the department agree that ($11.8 million) is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including BizJet’s voluntary disclosure, extraordinary cooperation and extensive remediation in this matter,” the agreement said. #### "

"BP proposes Gulf spill accord terms, trial delay","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers"," ##### NEW ORLEANS (Reuters)—BP P.L.C. reached settlements to resolve billions of dollars of claims from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and asked a U.S. judge for a long delay in any trial over remaining disputes stemming from the disaster. ####  ##### The London-based oil company still expects under Wednesday's settlements to pay $7.8 billion to resolve economic, property and medical claims by more than 100,000 individuals and businesses, though there is no cap. ####  ##### That payout would make the accord one of the largest class-action settlements in U.S. history. ####  ##### ""Neither side will receive everything it wants,"" but the settlements are ""more than fair, reasonable and adequate"" and could avert a decade of litigation, BP and plaintiffs' lawyers said in papers filed in New Orleans federal court. ####  ##### Friday is the two-year anniversary of the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which killed 11 workers and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill after BP's Macondo well ruptured. An estimated 4.1 million barrels of oil were spilled and not cleaned up. ####  ##### ""BP made a commitment to help economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf Coast,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. ""This settlement provides the framework for us to continue delivering on that promise, offering those affected full and fair compensation, without waiting for the outcome of a lengthy trial process."" ####  ##### In a separate statement, Stephen Herman and James Roy, lawyers on the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee, said the settlement holds BP ""fully accountable."" ####  ##### Lawyers for the plaintiffs are seeking up to $600 million to cover fees and costs, including a $75 million interim award. These are separate from amounts paid to victims. ####  ##### BP still faces tens of billions of dollars of potential claims from the U.S. government; Gulf states; and drilling partners Transocean Ltd., which owned the rig, and Halliburton Co., which provided cementing services. ####  ##### The oil company's potential liability for violating the federal Clean Water Act alone could reach as high as $17.6 billion upon a finding of gross negligence. BP has already taken a $37.2 billion charge for the spill. ####  ##### About 109,000 condominium owners, hotel and resort operators, restaurateurs, shrimpers and others may be eligible to recover on economic and property claims, court papers show. ####  ##### The medical settlement addresses claims by people made ill from exposure to oil or chemical dispersants. It covers clean-up workers and residents of beachfront or wetlands areas, an d lets people who develop symptoms later to sue BP at that time. About 16,000 plaintiffs have submitted claims, court papers show. ####  ##### Those ineligible to recover include financial institutions, casinos, people claiming hardship from an Obama administration moratorium on deepwater drilling, and some private plaintiffs in Florida and Texas. ####  ##### Wednesday's settlements follow depositions of 311 witnesses, and the production of about 90 million pages of documents and about 20 terabytes of data. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is scheduled to consider preliminary approval of the accords around Nov. 8, with final approval to come later. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### That suggests any trial on remaining issues—government pollution claims, claims against BP's drilling partners, and claims among BP and those partners—would not begin until well into 2013, if not later. Judge Barbier is expected to meet with the parties behind closed doors on May 3 to discuss the case. ####  ##### BP shares closed down 6.5 pence (10.3 cents) at £4.48 ($7.10) in London, Reuters data show. ####  ##### Prior to the settlement, the lawyer Kenneth Feinberg had paid out $6.1 billion to spill victims who submitted claims under BP's $20 billion Gulf Coast Claims Facility. ####  ##### BP expects the $7.8 billion payment to come from that trust. Claimants with final offers from Feinberg can receive 60% of their money now, and if eligible under the new program may receive the remaining 40% or seek higher awards. ####  ##### Payouts are continuing, and being overseen by Patrick Juneau, a Lafayette, La., lawyer appointed by the court. ####  ##### ""The PSC seems to believe the court-appointed administrator will be more generous than Feinberg,"" said Tony Buzbee, a lawyer in Houston who said he represents 15,000 people and businesses with claims. ""I believe the $7.8 billion figure will grow."" ####  ##### Wednesday's settlements award $2.3 billion to commercial fishermen, seafood boat captains and others for damage related to shrimp, oysters, blue crab and other species. ####  ##### Another $57 million will be used to ""promote the Gulf Coast,"" including tourism and the seafood industry. ####  ##### Last week, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi asked Judge Barbier to delay preliminary approval to let potential plaintiffs, including various Florida claimants and others who might be left out, assess the ""fairness and rationale"" behind the accords. ####  ##### Mr. Buzbee expects the settlements to win approval, and said their structures may limit opposition. ####  ##### ""That payments continue even while the settlement is being reviewed takes away one of the primary arguments an objector might have,"" he said. ""That the (legal) fees will not come out of victims' pockets will take a lot of the fire out of the bellies of people who might have objected,"" he added. ####  ##### Jennifer Meale, a spokeswoman for Ms. Bondi, said her office is reviewing the settlements. Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Spokespeople for other Gulf states, Halliburton and Transocean had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. #### "

Taking information from a user's profile, such as photos, the app places these around the house “to make them feel as though it is their own” residence being burglarized, Confused.com said in a statement. ####  ##### As if this were not enough, the video app lays on eerie music and a threatening burglar character who handles photos of the app user around the house and steals a laptop that displays the user's Facebook profile. The last shot shows the burglar holding a photo frame containing an image of the user, with the message, “Cover your possessions at Confused.com.” ####  ##### Sharon Flaherty, head of content at the website, said the video “is bound to make people feel uneasy as though their home really has been broken into. However, this is a situation which is very much a reality given that the British Crime Survey reported a 5% rise in burglary in the 12 months to September 2011.” ####  ##### “We're looking to spark conversation with this video app and make people understand the importance of having home insurance. With the current challenging financial times, people may stop insuring their possessions just to save a few pounds, but this is false economy,” Mike Hoban, marketing director at Confused.com, said in a statement. ####  ##### The statement, however, neither addresses the issue of why anyone would want to watch such a video nor does it give any word about insurance for the nightmares it may cause. #### "

Ltd., Sompo Japan Insurance Inc. and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. Ltd.—are limited to how much they can provide in maritime coverage without tapping into the European reinsurance market. ####  ##### The European Union will prohibit European insurers and reinsurers from indemnifying tankers carrying Iranian crude oil anywhere in the world from July, threatening to curtail shipments and raise costs for major buyers. Japan and South Korea have lobbied for exemptions, but insurance and shipping executives say a complete ban now looks likely. ####  ##### The three insurers together can only provide up to 30 billion yen ($370 million) at one time in hull and machinery cover, which protects vessels against physical damage, without relying on the European reinsurance market to hedge their risk. ####  ##### That was enough to cover insurance for only one tanker traveling inside the Gulf with Iranian crude oil, the industry sources said. ####  ##### ""The Japanese buyers who load Iran crude need to share information about schedules for loading. They haven't done so previously,"" said an industry source familiar with the matter. ####  ##### The insurers will be able to cover only three or four tankers of Iranian crude oil a month, since each ship takes about a week to 10 days to travel in and out of the Middle East Gulf, sources said. ####  ##### That translates to 6 million to 8 million barrels per month, or about 200,000 to 267,000 barrels per day, but the volumes are likely to be lower than that because Japanese buyers typically do not fully load the tankers, the sources added. ####  ##### The Japan P&I Club, the country's main ship insurer against pollution and personal injury claims, also has been forced to reduce its cover for a tanker carrying Iranian oil to $8 million from July 1 from the current $1 billion due to E.U. sanctions. #### "

"Britain seeks delay to E.U.'s Iran ship insurance ban","Risk Management","European Union, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Middle East/Africa, United Kingdom"," ##### LONDON (Reuters)—Britain is seeking to persuade fellow European Union members to postpone by up to six months a ban on providing insurance for tankers carrying Iranian oil, arguing that it could lead to a damaging spike in oil prices, European diplomats said. ####  ##### A European Union ban on importing Iranian oil, which takes effect on July 1, will also prevent E.U. insurers and reinsurers from covering tankers carrying its crude anywhere in the world. ####  ##### The impact of the measure is likely to be felt strongly in London's financial district, the centre for marine insurance. ####  ##### Iran exports most of its 2.2 million barrels of oil per day to Asia. The four main buyers—China, India, Japan and South Korea—have yet to find a way to replace the predominantly Western insurance shipping cover provided by London insurers. ####  ##### The sanctions seek to stem the flow of petrodollars to Tehran to force it to halt a nuclear program that the West suspects is intended to produce weapons. ####  ##### Some Indian and Chinese firms have already asked state insurers to step in and provide coverage by offering government guarantees. ####  ##### The situation is more complicated for Japan and South Korea, which have already cut imports of Iranian oil under pressure from Washington, but need Western protection and indemnity (P&I) ship insurance to continue importing the remaining volumes. ####  ##### ""Britain will be pushing the E.U. to postpone the ban on P&I insurance by six months,"" said one diplomatic source. ####  ##### ""The main reason is pressure from Japan and South Korea as they would struggle to buy oil after July 1,"" the source said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### He said Britain feared oil prices could rise sharply as a result of disruptions caused by the lack of insurance after July 1, as Japan and South Korea would be forced to bid aggressively for alternative supplies to meet their needs. ####  ##### A second European diplomatic source said he was aware of the British initiative. ####  ##### Both sources said Britain's proposal had yet to win support from other E.U. members, including France, which has been pushing for the toughest stance on Iran. ####  ##### But in Asia, some shippers welcomed the proposal. ####  ##### ""A six-month delay would give more time for alternative arrangements to be made or for the situation to become clearer,"" said Arthur Bowring, managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Assn. and a supporter of Britain's actions. ####  ##### ""It could also be an opening for a more permanent arrangement to be worked out."" ####  ##### It was not yet clear when the measure could be debated by E.U. officials as a meeting to review the embargo on Iranian oil has been rescheduled from the middle of May to an unspecified date. ####  ##### Japan, South Korea and India have lobbied E.U. officials for exemptions to the sanctions. ""One keeps hearing about positive developments on this issue, so we are hopeful that some positive outcome may come out,"" said S. Hajara, chairman of the Shipping Corp. of India. ####  ##### Negotiations between Iran and major world powers on nuclear issues resumed in Turkey in April after a 15-month hiatus. Another round of talks is scheduled for May 23 in Baghdad, but Iran has said it wants a softening of sanctions first. #### "
"Ruling upheld in case of discrimination against deaf job applicant","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### NEW ORLEANS—An appellate court has upheld a jury verdict against a temporary staffing agency in a disability case brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in which the temp agency allegedly refused to consider a deaf job applicant for a position. ####  ##### According to the April 26 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission vs. Service Temps Inc., doing business as Smith Personnel Solutions, in June 2006, Jacquelyn Moncada, who is deaf from birth, applied for a job as a stock clerk to package cosmetics for a client of the Cleburne, Texas-based temp agency. She arranged for a sign language interpreter to meet her at the job site to translate as she applied for the position, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Carl Ray, a Smith Personnel account manager, “told her she could not apply for the position because she is deaf, that the warehouse environment would be too dangerous for her,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Moncada filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in July 2006. After conciliation efforts failed, the issue eventually went to a jury trial. ####  ##### After a three-day trial in September 2010, the jury found Smith had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and awarded Ms. Moncada $14,400 in back pay, $20,000 in compensatory damages for emotional pain and suffering, and $150,000 in punitive damages. ####  ##### As a result of a subsequent motion, the punitive damages award was reduced to $68,800, but the court granted the EEOC injunctive relief, which required Smith to refrain from discriminating against disabled employees, among other provisions. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The temp agency appealed the trial court's decision based on several issues, including its imposition of injunctive relief, but was denied in a unanimous three-judge ruling of the appellate court. ####  ##### Smith “maintains that it should not have borne the burden of showing, essentially, that it would not violate the ADA in the future,” said the appellate court ruling. ####  ##### “In any event, Smith's argument only raises the question whether the district court was required to provide injunctive relief, not whether it had the discretion to do so, which it unquestionably did.” ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, plaintiffs attorney Paul W. Mollica, of counsel to law firm Outten & Golden L.L.P. in Chicago, who was not involved in the case, said the ruling is significant in part because EEOC hiring cases “tend to be scarce, so this is a very useful one.” ####  ##### It is also significant because of the appellate’ court’s ruling on the injunctive relief issue, he said. ####  ##### “The employer had the obligation to present not only a preponderance of evidence, but clear and convincing evidence” it would not to return to the same practice. It “failed to meet that burden at trial.” ####  ##### The judge held the injunction was mandatory, and the appellate court upheld that ruling, Mr. Mollica said. There is a “very strong presumption in favor of injunctive relief” in discrimination cases, Mr. Mollica said. ####  ##### A spokesman for the temp agency could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### In 2010, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco held that a United Parcel Service of America Inc. unit may have unlawfully discriminated against a deaf worker by failing to provide American Sign Language interpreters at all meetings. #### "

"Company settles age discrimination lawsuit with EEOC for $400,000","Risk Management",""," ##### DALLAS—Central Freight Lines Inc. has agreed to settle an age discrimination lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of eight former dockworkers for $400,000, the agency said. ####  ##### The EEOC said last week that according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas, the Waco, Texas-based firm discriminated against the eight workers, who all were at least 50 years old, by selecting them for termination in an August 2007 reduction in force because of their age. ####  ##### The consolidated suit filed by EEOC and the private parties charged the workers were called names such as “grandpa,” “old farts” and more derogatory terms by their supervisor, who had been asked to prepare a list of the men to be terminated. ####  ##### The EEOC said also the company changed its attendance and disciplinary policy so the men “were suddenly put on corrective action and eligible for termination under the new policy,” the agency said in a statement. ####  ##### The company agreed to pay $400,000 to the claimants and to train management and supervisory personnel at the Central Freight Dallas and Fort Worth terminals on equal employment opportunity policies and procedures, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### “Central Freight treated these experienced dockworkers like they were expendable. This case shows that EEOC will remain vigilant in our protection of older workers,” EEOC attorney Suzanne M. Anderson said in the statement. ####  ##### Central Freight responded in a statement that it “has denied from the onset of this litigation that it discriminated” against the workers or violated any federal or state statute. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “These eight former employees were included in a reduction-in-force that was brought about by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business need,” it said. “Also included in the reduction-in-force were five other individuals, all under the age of 40, thereby demonstrating Central Freight's lack of discriminatory motive.' ####  ##### Referring to the EEOC not mentioning these other workers in its press release on the settlement, Central Freight said in its statement, “Given that this was an undisputed fact during the litigation, we cannot help but wonder whether the true motivation behind the press release was simply to attempt to paint Central Freight in a negative light. ####  ##### “Further absent from the press release is the fact that the sole reason that Central Freight, the plaintiffs, and the EEOC settled this matter, and entered into the consent decree, was to avoid the expense of further litigation.  This fact, as well as Central Freight's denial of discrimination, are explicitly contained in the consent decree, but were also conspicuously absent from the EEOC's press release. It is unfortunate that the EEOC chose to omit these crucial items in their press release.” ####  ##### Many observers have said the EEOC's recently issued guidance on age discrimination policies goes beyond the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on the issue and will add a burden to employers. #### "

"EEOC, Arizona school district settle discriminatory retirement plan charges","Risk Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits"," ##### PHOENIX—An Arizona school district that was charged by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with having age discriminatory retirement plans has agreed to a $148,092 settlement. ####  ##### According to the EEOC, Tempe Elementary School District No. 3 used an early retirement incentive plan and a normal retirement plan that granted greater economic benefits to younger employees based solely on their age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. ####  ##### The school district's superintendent, Chris Bush, said Friday that its attorney-approved retirement policy had been in place for several decades with no complaint. But the agency said Thursday that as a result of its investigation and litigation, the school district has revised its retirement plans to comply with the ADEA. ####  ##### The school district also has agreed to pay workers who retired after April 3, 2008, the difference between what they received and what they should have been paid for those leave payouts had there been no unlawful discrimination. The settlement affects 49 retirees, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### The consent decree approved by a federal court in Phoenix also requires anti-discrimination training and a review of the school district's policies and practices, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### “Early retirement incentive plans and normal retirement plans which are facially discriminatory need to be changed,” EEOC Regional Attorney Mary Jo O'Neill said in a statement. “Discrimination on the basis of age is simply illegal. People in their 60s should not be penalized merely because they want to continue working. A retirement plan which states, for example, that employees 52 years old will receive a greater economic benefit than an employee 61 years old for retiring early is discriminatory on its face.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Ms. Bush said the school district had a policy for several decades under which school employees who retired at age 55 received 52% of their salary, a percentage that declined as they got older. The policy had been reviewed by attorneys, she said. ####  ##### “As far back as we can investigate, we think that it was a policy designed to incentivize employees back when we all had the early incentive programs,” said Ms. Bush. “No employees ever brought it to our attention, nobody every argued with it. Everybody retired and took their money and went on their way,” she said. ####  ##### “In 2010, the EEOC determined that the policy itself would possibly be discriminatory and launched an investigation, and the minute the EEOC made us aware of it, we changed the policy, and so everybody who's retired is paid at 52% of their daily rate of payment,” she said. ####  ##### “We've always been very generous to our retirees.

Method after incorporating Ms. Pasquella’s diet program. ####  ##### The P.I.N.K.

"EEOC wins summary judgment in retaliation case against BASF unit","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### URBANA, Ill.—A federal judge has ruled that a BASF Corp. unit unlawfully retaliated against an employee for refusing to waive his rights to file a discrimination charge, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said. ####  ##### The lawsuit was filed by the EEOC in August 2010 against Cognis Corp., which was acquired in December 2010 by Florham, N.J.-based BASF Corp., a North American affiliate of Ludwigshafen, Germany-based chemical company BASF S.E. ####  ##### A summary judgment ruling by Judge Michael P. McCuskey of U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois in Urbana, announced Wednesday, was issued May 23. ####  ##### The EEOC charged Cognis with retaliating against Steven Whitlow, a 19-year employee in its Kankakee, Ill., facility, by requiring him to sign a “last-chance” employment agreement that prohibited him from filing a discrimination charge with the EEOC, even if it was based on conduct that might occur in the future. ####  ##### The court found the company fired Mr. Whitlow when he refused to be bound by the agreement. The EEOC said the only remaining issue for trial with regard to Mr. Whitlow is the amount of damages due to him. ####  ##### The EEOC also charged that a class of employees who signed similar last-chance agreements was also retaliated against, because Cognis forced the workers to make a choice between termination and signing. The court denied the EEOC's summary judgment motion for these employees, and those claims will now proceed to trial, the EEOC said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### EEOC Chicago district director John Rowe said in a statement, “Filing EEOC charges? is a fundamental right of American employees, and this agency always stands ready to protect that fight. This court’s opinion should cause employers to remember that seeking to dissuade employees from exercising that right is not only bad policy, it’s a violation of federal law which can give rise to very substantial liability.” ####  ##### BASF said in a statement that it “respectfully disagrees with the Court’s ruling with respect to Mr. Whitlow and is evaluating its immediate options. BASF Corp. is deeply committed to equal employment opportunity and takes its responsibilities for compliance with all federal, state and local laws seriously. This commitment includes maintaining a vigorous compliance program to ensure our high standards are met consistently throughout the organization.” #### "
"Property/casualty insurers upgrading policy administration systems: Analysis","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Tech Insights"," ##### Economic and market conditions are encouraging property/casualty insurers to replace or upgrade policy administration systems, according to a report from New York-based research and advisory services firm Novarica released last week. ####  ##### The report, “Novarica Market Navigator: US Property/Casualty Policy Administration Systems 2012 (Q2),” analyzes the factors prompting policy administration replacement and also profiles 58 property/casualty-specific policy administration systems. ####  ##### Authored by Novarica partner Chad Hersh and Novarica analyst Lis Maguda, the report said while the need to improve customer-facing technologies until recently was a priority mainly for personal lines insurers, commercial lines insurers are now feeling pressured by evolving customer expectations around functions such as quoting and claims management. According to earlier Novarica research, roughly a third of insurers are currently replacing or planning to replace a policy administration system. ####  ##### “On the commercial side, the rise of online self-service across many consumer industries has raised the expectations of users in general, forcing carriers to provide certain online capabilities even for lines of business that just a few years ago seemed safe from such requirements,” the report states. “Inflexible legacy policy administration systems can prevent insurers from being able to take advantage of new opportunities and being able to meet customer and agent expectations.” ####  ##### Mr. Hersh and Ms. Maguda say modern administration systems are constructed to enable increased data accessibility, which can aid in areas such as regulatory reporting as well as providing data for models used in everything from rates/pricing to fraudulent claim detection. ####  ##### Moreover, they say that a modern system may help reduce long-term total cost of ownership as finding information technology staff to maintain legacy system becomes more difficult as the systems age. ####  ##### “Attracting and retaining IT staff and even front- and back-office employees is also increasingly important as today's job seekers increasingly lack the skills—or the desire—to work on 30+ year-old systems,” the report states. #### "
"Social media has immediate impact on insurance industry: Experts","Risk Management","Tech Insights"," ##### Of all the major technology trends impacting the insurance industry, the ramifications of the rise of social media as a cultural force may well be the most immediate. ####  ##### While the recent Facebook IPO debacle has done much to tarnish the shine of the pioneering social media company, social technologies already are beginning to have a profound impact on the insurance industry, experts say. ####  ##### Insurance companies have long leveraged social platforms for marketing and brand building, but now they also are finding that social mediums furnish a bounty of data that can be used to improve the underwriting and claims process. For example, social data is especially useful in helping insurance companies ferret out claims fraud, said Stephen Applebaum, a senior analyst at Boston-based independent research and advisory firm Aite Group L.L.C. ####  ##### “Social data is a new pool of information for fraud research that hasn't really been tapped,” Mr. Applebaum said during a panel discussion held at The Insurance Accounting Systems Assn. Inc.'s annual conference in San Diego on Tuesday. “It's economically productive for insurers to mine that data.” ####  ##### Fellow panelist Max Drucker, CEO and president of Social Intelligence Corp., a social media screening and investigative services firm based in Santa Barbara, Calif., cited an example where a workers compensation insurer used social media to uncover a fraudulent claim. A warehouse worker who claimed to have injured his arm also played guitar in a bar band. After spotting an advertisement for his show on Myspace, the insurance company sent an investigator to photograph the concert and subsequently denied the claim. “Social media can be the smoking gun, but it is best used in conjunction with other things,” Mr. Drucker said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Moreover, Mr. Drucker noted that people often have complex online identities involving multiple social platforms and email addresses. “There's a ton of information out there and it's not all on Facebook,” he said. ####  ##### In addition to insurance companies utilizing social media platforms aimed at consumers, there also are social technologies built expressly for enterprises. Austin, Texas-based ProspX Inc. provides a collaborative software platform built for the insurance industry. ProspX President and CEO Todd L. Young said that social technologies are well suited to help streamline complex collaborative processes and gather and filter information and expertise on a given topic. “We have built a business social system for commercial insurance that helps bring in just the relevant information based on the opportunity the producer or broker is working on,” Mr. Young said. ####  ##### Historically, technologies gestated in the enterprise before reaching the public. Social media and mobile technologies have inverted that trend. While the consumer market eventually may abandon Facebook in the years ahead, the use of social technologies by insurers is likely here to stay. #### "

""We can trade with no problems at all everywhere in Asia."" ####  ##### He declined to give figures for shipments, however, and his comments contrasted with evidence from Asian buyers that they were significantly scaling back purchases from Iran. These included a senior Chinese oil executive who said this week that refiner Sinopec will cut imports by up to one-fifth this year. ####  ##### Iran-based shipping sources said in April that Iran had been forced to deploy more than half of its national tanker fleet to store oil at anchorage due to the Western measures. ####  ##### The National Iranian Tanker Co.—now known as NITC—lost its ship insurance cover from European providers last year due to Western sanctions imposed on Iran. It secured alternative cover mainly in Asia and also in Iran from privately owned Kish P&I. ####  ##### ""We have $1 billion (in protection and indemnity cover).

It noted they had made significant cuts in oil imports from Iran. ####  ##### Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. ####  ##### In April, two Iran-based shipping sources said Iran had been forced to deploy more than half its fleet to store oil at anchorage in the Gulf, equating to 33 million barrels. Other industry sources have also estimated that Iran could be storing tens of millions of barrels of oil on tankers. ####  ##### Asked how many vessels his company was using to store Iranian oil, the NITC official said: ""It is not many."" ####  ##### Last month the U.S. Senate approved a package of new economic sanctions on Iran's oil sector that would extend measures to dealings with NITC and the National Iranian Oil Co., if they are deemed to be an agent or affiliate of the Revolutionary Guards. ####  ##### It aims to close a potential loophole that could have allowed Tehran to continue selling some of its oil using its own fleet.

"Bank rate rigging scandal widens, Diamond fights on","Risk Management","United Kingdom"," ##### LONDON (Reuters)—A scandal over the rigging of key interest rates could plunge the global banking industry into a legal morass for years, analysts said, as the head of Barclays Bank P.L.C. fought to hold onto his job. ####  ##### With the Times newspaper naming Royal Bank of Scotland Group P.L.C. as the next bank facing a fine for its alleged involvement in manipulating the key lending rate between banks, the head of the Bank of England said there needed to be ""real change"" in the industry's culture. ####  ##### Referring to what he called the ""deceitful manipulation"" of rates, Mervyn King told a news conference on Friday the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) should be reformed to reflect actual market transactions. ####  ##### U.S. and British authorities fined Barclays $453 million on Wednesday for manipulating LIBOR, which underpins some $360 trillion of loans and financial contracts around the world—and analysts forecast more banks would soon be named for collusion. ####  ##### ""Reading the statements by the authorities we expect to get settlements by others in the course of time which could be more punitive,"" analysts at Credit Suisse said. ####  ##### Others predicted Barclays and other banks could face billions in costs from litigation, especially in the United States, in much the same way that oil major BP ran into drawn-out legal rows over its oil spill. ####  ##### ""Given the long-tailed nature of investigations we expect this to be a long-term overhang,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Chris Manners. ####  ##### Barclays was the first bank to settle in an investigation which is looking at other large financial institutions in Europe, Japan and North America, including Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings P.L.C. and UBS A.G. No criminal charges have been filed. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The Times said RBS faced a likely fine of 150 million pounds ($233.9 million) for participating in market manipulation offences similar to those engaged in by Barclays. The bank said no fine or settlement had been decided upon. ####  ##### The heaviest pressure remained on Barclays chief Bob Diamond, who was running the investment banking arm Barclays Capital when the rigging occurred in 2005-2009, despite his vow not to quit. ####  ##### Britain's popular tabloid newspaper The Sun tore into the banker, calling him ""Bob the Rob"" and saying: ""Never in the past four miserable years have bankers been more hated than now."" ####  ##### Prime Minister David Cameron said Diamond would appear before parliament's Treasury Select Committee, adding, ""He and his management team have serious questions to answer."" ####  ##### ""People are rightly angry about the behavior of the banks and so am I,"" Prime Minister Cameron told a news conference in Brussels. ####  ##### Britain has also called in the fraud squad to investigate possible crimes. ####  ##### ""Politicians have already been baying for blood and calling for the head of Bob Diamond,"" said Stephen Peak, manager of the Henderson UK Alpha and European Absolute Return funds and a shareholder in the bank. ####  ##### ""We feel that the Barclays board will instinctively wish to resist this, as Diamond is clearly the architect and leading light of Barclays, but feel that the pressure may be too great."" ####  ##### Diamond told Morgan Stanley analysts on Thursday he did not intend to stand down and sources close to the bank said Barclays' shareholders were satisfied with the bank's decision to come clean and settle. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### One fund manager at a top 100 Barclays shareholder said he did not think senior management was to blame for the scandal. ####  ##### ""Realistically, how is the guy sitting several layers above going to have any knowledge of that, unless they were explicitly encouraging it—which they don't appear to have done in this instance."" ####  ##### However, he added, neither Barclays or RBS had acted quickly enough to tell shareholders what was happening. ####  ##### ""No one has come to us to try and explain anything. Barclays have settled early, so they can no longer claim uncertainty of outcomes in the same way but investors are still subject to reasonable uncertainty as to how much this might cost them in the end."" ####  ##### The father of one Barclays customer described the bank's behavior as ""toxic and disgraceful"" and said he would close down his child's account. ####  ##### ""To learn of this scandal where they are fixing LIBOR to benefit themselves... I just cannot believe that behavior,"" said Lynne Brooke, a Hampshire-based solicitor. ####  ##### Authorities investigating the Libor scandal are looking at banks in Europe, North America and Japan. ####  ##### In response to the Times report RBS said it continued to co-operate with regulators on the ongoing investigation, adding any resolution of its case was months away. ####  ##### ""The process is not as far advanced as the (Times) article suggests and there can be no certainty as to the timing or amount of any fine or settlement at this point,"" the bank, which is part-nationalized, said in a statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Like Mr. Diamond, RBS Chief Executive Stephen Hester will waive his bonus this year, a source close to the lender said, but the gesture has been presented as an apology for the recent computer systems failure which caused disruption to millions of customers, and unrelated to the LIBOR probe. ####  ##### The Barclays rate-fixing affair, which disclosed emails in which bankers appeared to promise bottles of champagne to each other for help in setting the rates, has fuelled anger from taxpayers struggling with austerity measures who are now closely watching the banks they bailed out during the financial crisis. ####  ##### Adding to their ire, the Financial Services Authority said on Friday it had found ""serious failings"" in the way specialist insurance had been sold by Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Lloyds, concluding they mis-sold products. ####  ##### Compensation could run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, lawyers have said, although Lloyds and Barclays said the cost for it would not be material. ####  ##### The FSA said from 2001 to date, banks sold around 28,000 interest rate protection products to customers. ####  ##### ""Such products took advantage of small businesses, many of which could not reasonably have been expected to understand what they were signing up to, at a time when loans were difficult to come by. This is completely unacceptable,"" said Andrew Tyrie, head of parliament's Treasury Select Committee. ####  ##### A string of mis-selling cases has damaged the financial services industry for over two decades. Banks are already committed to paying upwards of 9 billion pounds ($14.0 billion) to customers in compensation for mis-selling loan insurance. ####  ##### Barclays shares closed down 1.7%, the weakest major European bank. The EU bank index rallied 4% after Euro zone leaders agreed emergency action to cut Spain's and Italy's borrowing costs. #### "

"Racial discrimination lawsuit against Humana reinstated ","Risk Management",""," ##### CINCINNATI—A federal appeals court has reinstated a putative class action racial discrimination case brought by a former Humana Inc. employee in a technical legal ruling. ####  ##### According to Monday's 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Kathryn Keys vs. Humana Inc., Ms. Keys, a former director at the Louisville, Ky.-based health insurer who is African-American, stated that after two reorganizations, her role and responsibilities had been diminished unlike those of Caucasian directors. ####  ##### Humana terminated Ms. Keys' employment in June 2008, citing a 2006 negative performance assessment and ignoring a 2007 favorable performance appraisal, according to the ruling. Ms. Keys filed a lawsuit against Humana in October 2009. ####  ##### A district court dismissed the suit in July 2010, concluding that Ms. Keys had failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. ####  ##### This framework, which stems from a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonnell Douglas Corp. vs. Green, states that to establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must establish that she is member of a protected class; that she was qualified for her job; that she suffered an adverse employment decision; and that she was replaced by a person from outside the protected class, or treated differently than similarly situated nonprotected employees. ####  ##### The district court found Ms. Keys had failed to meet the last qualification. ####  ##### However, the appellate court said the district court had incorrectly applied the McDonnell Douglas framework in its ruling because it should be used as a standard to evaluate evidence, not merely to plead a case. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “The district court's requiring that Keys' complaint establish a prima facie cause under McDonnell Douglas and its progeny is contrary to Supreme Court and 6th Circuit precedent,” said a three-judge panel's unanimous ruling. ####  ##### Citing the Supreme Court's 2002 ruling in Swierkiewicz vs. Sorema N.A., the appellate court said, “The Supreme Court unanimously held that the prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas is an evidentiary standard, not a pleading standard…As the court reasoned, 'it is not appropriate to require a plaintiff to plead facts establishing a prima facie case because the McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply in every employment discrimination case.” ####  ##### “Keys adequately alleged the components of her claim and of her class action case, both of which now may be defined further through the discovery process,” the court said, in remanding the case. ####  ##### A Humana spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, Jonathan T. Hyman, a partner with law firm Kohrman Jackson & Krantz P.L.L. in Cleveland, who was not involved in the case, said the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which sets out pleading standards for complaints filed in federal court, “simply requires a short and plain statement of the claim.” ####  ##### As federal courts become more comfortable analyzing discrimination claims, the need of the McDonnell Douglas analysis is “falling by the wayside,” he said. ####  ##### In a related ruling, the 6th Circuit late last month upheld an award to an African-American custodian who accused a school district of racial discrimination and retaliation in connection with his demotion and transfer to another school in Clifford Litton vs. Talawanda School District. #### "

"Dai-ichi, Korea Life bid for ING's Southeast Asia business ","Risk Management","European Union, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Australia & New Zealand"," ##### (Reuters)—Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and Korea Life were first out of the blocks to submit second-round bids on Monday for ING's insurance operations in Southeast Asia, as the Dutch insurer moves to divest its Asian operations. ####  ##### Binding bids for ING's Asian insurance and asset management operations are due on Monday and a wide range of suitors, from the son of Asia's richest man and a former rugby player in New Zealand to more established players including AIA Group and Manulife Financial Corp, are expected to place offers in a deal worth about $7 billion. ####  ##### ING is selling its businesses in the region as it needs to repay a bailout from the Dutch government during the 2008 financial crisis. Since the bailout, ING has sold €15.2 billion ($18.6 billion) worth of assets around the world. ####  ##### “Yes, Dai-ichi made an offer,” one source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The source declined to be identified as the matter was not public. ####  ##### Korea Life has also submitted bid for ING's a Southeast Asian operations, a South Korean report said on Monday. ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian business have been in hot demand, and the business could fetch about $2 billion, one person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Life insurance premiums in Southeast Asia are forecast to grow rapidly on the back of strong economic growth. ####  ##### Dai-ichi and other Japanese insurers are under growing pressure to expand overseas as they face weak growth prospect at home. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A spokesman for Dai-ichi and Korea Life declined to comment. ####  ##### KB Financial Group submitted a bid for ING's South Korean insurance business, the local Maeil Business Newspaper reported. ####  ##### ING chief executive Jan Hommen scrapped a joint IPO of its Europe and Asia units in favor of an Asian sale about six months ago. Since then, the worsening euro zone crisis has put some potential buyers off big merger and acquisition bets. Metlife and Prudential Financial Inc., considered strong contenders for ING's insurance business, have dropped out of the process. ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian operations were also expected to draw second-round bids for parts of the business from two other groups, sources familiar with the process said. ####  ##### One consortium is led by ex-AIA CEO and a former rugby player Mark Wilson, backed by private equity firm Blackstone Group L.P. and Swiss Re Ltd., while the other is headed by Richard Li, son of billionaire Li Ka-shing, which is likely to be interested only in the Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand businesses. ####  ##### Wilson was in charge of AIA when it planned an initial public offering in 2009, but was replaced the next year after a failed bid for AIA by British insurer Prudential P.L.C. ####  ##### There is some skepticism over either consortium having a chance of winning. ####  ##### “It gets complicated when you bring a private equity fund into the picture,” said Hong Kong-based Keefe, Bruyette & Woods insurance analyst Stanley Tsai. “They will need an exit strategy in the next two to three years, making the deal more difficult to execute from a regulatory standpoint.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian operations could be sold at nearly two times embedded value, one source said. South Korea and Japan account for about two-thirds of ING's Asian business, but Japan may prove to be a stumbling block in the auction due to the €18 billion ($21.9 billion) worth of high-guarantee variable annuity policies the local operation has on its books. ####  ##### The companies mentioned in this report either declined to comment or were not available for immediate comment. ####  ##### Monday's binding bids could set the stage for a final round of negotiations, after which ING will decide whether to sell the life business en bloc or break it up and sell Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia separately. ING has not set a reserve price, and CEO Hommen said in May that Asian divestments would probably fetch less than €8 billion ($9.80 billion). ####  ##### Nomura Holdings is helping ING to find a solution for its Japanese operations, while Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are advising ING on the rest of the auction. ####  ##### Manulife may bid for the entire Asian operation, while AIA is interested in South Korea and Southeast Asia, sources said. Though some sources said, the Canadian financial company could also skip Japan. ####  ##### ING's Asia operations offer a platform for insurers keen to expand in a region enjoying rapid economic growth. Life insurance premiums in emerging Asia are forecast to grow 8.7% next year, nearly double the world average, according to Swiss Re estimates. ####  ##### Binding bids for ING's asset management business are also due this week, with Nikko Asset Management, U.S.-based Principal Financial Group, Royal Bank of Canada, Singapore's United Overseas Bank and Manulife expected to participate. The asset management sale is expected to fetch about $600 million. #### "

"Banks in Libor probe consider group settlement: Sources","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters)—A group of banks being investigated in an interest-rate rigging scandal are looking to pursue a group settlement with regulators rather than face a Barclays P.L.C.-style backlash by going it alone, people familiar with the banks' thinking said. ####  ##### Such discussions are preliminary, and it is unclear if regulators will enter these talks, aimed at resolving allegations that banks attempted to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars in contracts. ####  ##### Still, there are powerful incentives for the banks to enter joint negotiations. ####  ##### Barclays was the first to settle with U.S. and British regulators, paying a $453 million penalty and admitting to its role in a deal announced June 27. Its chief executive, Bob Diamond, abruptly quit the next week, bowing to public pressure and erosion of the bank's reputation. ####  ##### The sources told Reuters that none of the banks involved now want to be second in line for fear that they will get similarly hostile treatment from politicians and the public. Bank discussions about a group settlement initially took place before the Barclays agreement, and picked back up in the aftermath. ####  ##### It is unclear which banks are involved in the potential settlement talks. More than a dozen banks are being investigated in the scandal, including Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings P.L.C., Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co. They all declined to comment. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A group agreement would appeal to financial watchdogs because they would be able to announce a headline-grabbing figure, showing that they were dealing firmly with the banking industry's misdemeanors, a banker told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ####  ##### Earlier this year, five top U.S. banks negotiated a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and other federal and state agencies to resolve allegations of mortgage services abuses. ####  ##### The key regulators involved in the Libor case include the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Britain's Financial Services Authority. The CFTC was not available for comment, and the FSA declined to comment. ####  ##### The main obstacle facing such a group settlement is hesitancy on the part of the investment banks to work together in the fevered atmosphere surrounding the Libor investigations. Negotiations and haggling could drag on for some time and a resolution was far from certain, the banker said. ####  ##### The fact that each bank possibly had to settle with a different group of regulators, and that the charges were different in each case also made the chances of success of such a settlement small, a source at one of the banks being probed said. ####  ##### However, if they were able to reach a group settlement it would enable them to share the pain of negative publicity. ####  ##### While Barclays received a 30% ""discount"" on the fines for cooperating fully with authorities, it sustained far more serious damage with the subsequent loss of its top management and a public pillorying at the hands of politicians. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The specter of severe penalties from regulators and the possibility of multi-billion dollar class action suits has hung over more than a dozen banks being investigated worldwide since the extent of attempts to rig Libor became clear in CFTC and FSA documents released with the Barclays settlement. ####  ##### Analysts have estimated that the scandal could cost the industry between $20 billion to $40 billion, further damaging a sector that is struggling to work its way through the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, economic downturns in Europe and the United States, and increased regulatory demands. ####  ##### Libor rates are set daily in London for a range of currencies and maturities. Banks submit rates for unsecured loans to one another and the rates after high and low rates are thrown out, are averaged. ####  ##### Among the Barclays disclosures that sparked outrage were emails that showed employees asking for the submitted rates to be changed. ####  ##### ""Done...for you big boy,"" read a message sent by a Barclays banker to one of the lender's traders, who had asked him to fix Libor at an artificially low level. ####  ##### ""Dude, I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I'm opening a bottle of Bollinger,"" a trader from another firm emailed a banker at Barclays, showing his thanks for the rate set artificially low. ####  ##### The unfolding scandal also has raised questions about what the regulators knew and what actions they took to rein in the activity. Documents released by the Fed show it was repeatedly warned about Libor manipulation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In 2008, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who was then head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, sent a private email to Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King advising him of concerns about the rate's integrity and suggesting six ways to improve it. Mr. King passed the suggestions along and minor changes were made, according to documents released last week. ####  ##### Earlier this week, Mr. King put the Libor issue on the agenda of the Economic Consultative Committee of global central bankers that will meet in Basel, Switzerland, on Sept. 9. ####  ##### Libor rates underpin an estimated $550 trillion in financial products, including consumer loans, mortgages, municipal bonds and corporate paper. They are also considered a gauge of a bank's health. Investigators are looking at whether banks low-balled the rates to hide their borrowing costs in the 2007-09 financial crisis, and to profit on trades before the crisis hit. ####  ##### The scandal has also raised questions if Libor should be calculated differently. In Asia, the Hong Kong Assn. of Banks said it was reviewing the mechanism for determining its Hibor benchmark. ####  ##### The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was examining the setting of the Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor), widely used in the pricing of mortgages and other loans in the city-state. ####  ##### The Japanese banking industry lobby has asked the 18 banks contributing to the Tokyo interbank offered rate (Tibor) to check whether correct procedures were being followed, although the group's head said he did not believe there was a problem. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Banks on the Libor panel submit rates based on their estimates of how much it costs them to borrow from each other. The rate is thus subjective, as opposed to basing the benchmarks more on actual lending rates, so less manipulation is possible. The Australian Bank Bill Swaps Reference Rates, for example, are based on where paper is actually traded on the market. ####  ##### The issue is similar for Euribor—launched with the single currency in 1999—prompting the ECB to call for a re-think, including possibly shifting the basis of the calculation to actual lending rates. #### "
"As crop losses mount, farmers seen quicker to claim ","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### (Reuters)—The drought ravaging America's prime farmland is having an unexpected consequence that could shape the future of agricultural finance: In some cases, farmers who have amped up their insurance coverage may be giving up on their crops early rather than to trying to save them. ####  ##### Anecdotal evidence and economic assumptions suggest that a record number of farmers are likely preparing to file insurance claims this year, opting to plow under their withered crops—some without bothering to administer the costly pesticides and weed killers that might help salvage a dwindling harvest. ####  ##### Call it ""moral hazard"" in the heartland: with the growing use of federally backed crop insurance, a shift toward larger policies and newer schemes that protect revenue, some experts say farmers may now be better off claiming a total loss than eking out a shrunken harvest—a move that could exacerbate a 50% surge in corn prices by further reducing supply. ####  ##### ""Why spend money trying to save a crop when every bushel of crop you save is then going to reduce the indemnity that you would otherwise receive?"" said Vince Smith, an economist at Montana State University who has been critical of the program. ####  ##### ""The higher level of coverage means that you need a small shortfall in yield in order to be eligible for an indemnity payment, so these moral hazard effects come into effect more frequently,"" he said, referring to the economic theory in which one party may take excessive risk to the detriment of another. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Indemnified losses are likely to significantly exceed last year's record $10.7 billion, experts say, a sum that will be shared by the government programs that subsidize the dozen or so specialist crop insurance firms that sell the policies. ####  ##### Consumers across the world also will pay at the grocery store: as more farmers give up, the corn crop shrinks, propelling prices even further beyond last year's $8 a bushel. Some analysts began revising down their crop estimates this week on the basis that millions of acres may not be harvested at all. ####  ##### As it plays out, the trend may have far-reaching implications in Washington, where Congress is in the final furlong of hammering out a multiyear farm bill—the cornerstone of which was expected to be an expanded insurance scheme, something that now faces even greater scrutiny. ####  ##### The growth in crop insurance is well documented. A decade ago, insurance covered about 75% of the U.S. corn crop; last year it covered 85% of all planted acres. ####  ##### But more importantly, farmers also have been shifting toward policies that offer a greater level of protection. ####  ##### In 2004, farmers who took out policies at 75% or more coverage represented less than 40% of the total sum of insured acres. By last year that share had risen to 63%, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency data compiled by Thomson Reuters Lanworth, a natural resources intelligence firm. ####  ##### While it is too early to see any definitive evidence of the total indemnity costs, early data supports anecdotal reports of greater activity. As of July 16, insurance indemnities for all crops stand at $446 million compared with $230 million at this time a year ago, according to RMA data. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### At the same time, U.S. corn production is shrinking by the hour amid the worst drought in more than 50 years. The government slashed its production forecast by 12% just last week; by this week, analysts said output had likely fallen a further 7% due to the drought. ####  ##### It is not just the level of coverage that matters; the type is also key. ####  ##### Disaster modeling company AIR Worldwide, in a recent report on the drought, said most farmers in the Corn Belt took out revenue protection policies with a harvest price option—contracts that will, in other words, pay them for the crops they would have harvested at the price they would have gotten at market even if they plow under instead. ####  ##### To be sure, for every farmer thinking about cashing in on their insurance there are plenty who are still fighting the fight. Ben Hollis, who farms corn and soybeans in Petersburg, Ill., raised his revenue protection level this year and held off on fungicide as a waste of money—but he is adamant the two are not linked. ####  ##### ""If you continually try to raise (a) poor crop and cash in on your insurance, then you'll have a terrible average. I would resent the idea that I would ignore pesticide or fungicide because I have insurance,"" he said. ""I want to produce something. When I do something I want to do it right."" ####  ##### For the most part, it is too early to see direct evidence of abandoned crops. Farmers generally must receive confirmation of their claim from the insurer before destroying their fields, and the speed of the drought is straining adjusters who would normally be busy only after the autumn harvest. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""Insurance claims are coming in like it's the fall,"" says Washington-based agricultural trade consultant John Baize, who has worked closely with farmers for over three decades. ####  ##### Lanworth crop scouts toured more than 50 fields across northern Iowa, and dozens more in southern Illinois and northeastern Missouri, over the past two weeks without observing any plowed-under fields, they said. ####  ##### However there was little doubt of widespread losses, potentially exceeding the drought of 1988 when more than 5% of planted acres in Iowa were not harvested in Iowa. ####  ##### ""We observed fields in northwestern Iowa with cracks in the soil nine inches long and one and a half inches deep—what this crop needs is weeks of rain to abate the dry soil conditions,"" says Lanworth senior analyst Alexis Maxwell. Some fields had almost no pollinated ears of corn, she said. ####  ##### ""We saw a few crop dusters. It looks like some farmers just cannot give up hope on this crop and are trying to save it, but what we really need is not fertilizer but days of rain."" ####  ##### Still, the economics of calling in the insurance claims adjuster are growing more attractive daily. ####  ##### If the fall harvest price is $8 a bushel, a farmer who has 80% insurance coverage and an actual production history of 180 bushels an acre would get $1,152 an acre if their field is a total loss and they did not sell any crops forward, according to Iowa State University economist Bruce Babcock. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Babcock noted that in the spring, when corn was planted, prices were around $5 a bushel. The farmer who thought he would get his 180 bushel/acre yield at that $5 price was expecting to make $900 an acre. ####  ##### ""So, in fact, this farmer with insurance may actually come out ahead if his field is a total loss and he did not forward contract the crop,"" Mr. Babcock said in an email interview. ####  ##### Policies require farmers to notify insurance companies of crop damage within 15 days, adjusters say.

"Swiss regulator quizzes Credit Suisse, UBS on Libor","Risk Management","Switzerland"," ##### ZURICH (Reuters)—Swiss regulator FINMA said it is questioning UBS A.G. and Credit Suisse Group in an investigation over possible Libor interest rate rigging. ####  ##### ""We are actively going after information that will enable us to make a judgment on what has happened,"" a spokesman for the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority told Reuters on Monday. ####  ##### The two banks are not under formal investigation, as Swiss banks are legally obliged to cooperate with FINMA, which regulates the country's banks. ####  ##### Credit Suisse said on July 16 it did not expect a ""material"" impact from the regulatory probe. ####  ##### UBS, which is already being investigated by the Swiss competition authority WEKO over its role in the Libor scandal, said in its first quarter report it has been granted conditional leniency or conditional immunity from authorities in certain jurisdictions. ####  ##### These include the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and WEKO and relate to potential antitrust or competition law violations related to submissions for Yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor. ####  ##### UBS is reporting second quarter results on Tueday at 0445 GMT. ####  ##### Should FINMA conclude that the banks violated Swiss regulations, it can demand changes both at organizational and managerial level. ####  ##### The spokesman also said that Swiss authorities were in close contact with investigators around the world.

"Appeals court revives U.S. farmers' suit over milk prices ","Risk Management",""," ##### SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters)—Milk farmers can proceed with a class action accusing dairy product manufacturers of manipulating the price of raw milk, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. ####  ##### The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco revived a lawsuit brought by dairy farmers accusing milk powder supplier DairyAmerica Inc. of understating its prices to the U.S. Agriculture Department. That misinformation depressed raw milk prices, shortchanging American dairy farmers millions of dollars between 2002 and 2007, the suit alleged. ####  ##### Manufacturers like DairyAmerica are required to report their product prices to the USDA, which uses the information to set prices paid to farmers under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. ####  ##### In 2007, a dairy industry publication, The Milkweed, revealed that DairyAmerica had undervalued its nonfat dry milk by illegally incorporating the low prices from long-term contracts in its reports to the USDA. ####  ##### Four farmers, Gerald Carlin, John Rahm, Paul Rozwadowski and Bryan Wolfe, sued DairyAmerica and its majority owner California Dairies Inc. in 2009 on behalf of milk farmers around the country. ####  ##### In 2010, a federal court in Fresno dismissed the case, finding that suit was barred under the ""filed rate doctrine"" which prevents people from suing over rates filed with and reviewed by government agencies. The judge-created law, often used to defend against price-fixing suits, prevents courts from second-guessing agencies' expertise. ####  ##### But the 9th Circuit on Tuesday decided that the rule did not bar the farmers' suit because the USDA had investigated DairyAmerica's conduct and found its reported rates improper. The total value of raw milk was understated by $50 million between 2006 and 2007, according to an agency report. ####  ##### The appeals court said the case was exceptional due to the large and undisputed scope of the misreporting and the fact that the USDA recognized the rates as incorrect and would not produce a flood of cases. ####  ##### ""Our holding will not permit a flood of litigation such that the filed rate doctrine will be circumvented every time a milk producer has a quibble with FMMO prices,"" Judge George Wu wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. ####  ##### Benjamin Brown, a lawyer at Cohen Milstein who represented the farmers, welcomed the decision and the opportunity to proceed with the case before the district court. ####  ##### Neither DairyAmerica nor the company's lawyer, Charles English of Davis Wright Tremaine, immediately responded to requests for comment. ####  ##### John Vlahos of Hanson Bridgett, who represents California Dairies, was not immediately available to comment. #### "
"N.Y. says 'rogue' bank hid $250B in Iran deals, may pull license","Risk Management","United Kingdom"," ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—New York's top bank regulator threatened to strip Standard Chartered P.L.C. of its state banking license, saying the British bank was a ""rogue institution"" that hid $250 billion in transactions tied to Iran, in violation of U.S. law. ####  ##### The New York State Department of Financial Services said Standard Chartered ""schemed"" with the Iranian government and hid from law enforcement officials some 60,000 secret transactions to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees over nearly 10 years, also exposing the U.S. banking system to terrorists, drug traffickers and corrupt states. ####  ##### The loss of a New York banking license would be a devastating blow for a foreign bank, effectively cutting off direct access to the U.S. bank market. Standard Chartered processes $190 billion every day for global clients, the New York bank regulator said. ####  ##### In an unusual look inside a bank, the regulator described how Standard Chartered officials debated whether to continue Iranian dealings. In October 2006, the top official for business in the Americas, whom the regulator did not name, warned in a ""panicked message"" that the Iranian dealings could cause ""catastrophic reputational damage"" and ""serious criminal liability."" ####  ##### A top executive in London shot back: ""You f---ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians."" The reply showed ""obvious contempt for U.S. banking regulations,"" the regulator said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Standard Chartered is the third British bank to be ensnared in U.S. law enforcement probes this summer. Barclays P.L.C. agreed to pay $453 million to settle U.S. and U.K. probes that it rigged a global lending benchmark in June. A month later, a U.S. Senate panel issued a scathing report that criticized HSBC Holding P.L.C.'s efforts to police suspect transactions, including Mexican drug traffickers. ####  ##### In a statement, Standard Chartered said the bank ""does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts."" ####  ##### It said it shared with U.S. agencies an analysis that demonstrated it ""acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply"" with U.S. regulations. Standard Chartered put the total value of Iran-related transactions that did not follow regulations at less than $14 million. ####  ##### ""The group was therefore surprised to receive the order from the DFS, given that discussions with the agencies were ongoing,"" Standard Chartered said. ""We intend to discuss these matters with the DFS and to contest their position."" ####  ##### The DFS declined further comment. The Representative Office of Iran in Washington was not immediately available to comment. The Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. economic and trade sanctions against targeted countries, declined to comment. ####  ##### Standard Chartered, a financier in emerging markets, is the sixth foreign bank since 2008 to be implicated in dealings with sanctioned countries such as Iran in investigations led by federal and New York law enforcement officials. ####  ##### Four banks—Barclays, Lloyds, Credit Suisse Group and ING Bank—have agreed to fines and settlements totaling $1.8 billion. HSBC currently is under investigation by U.S. law enforcement, according to bank regulatory filings. ####  ##### The New York regulator, headed by former prosecutor Benjamin Lawsky, ordered Standard Chartered to explain why the bank should not lose its state license and the ability to process dollar transactions. Mr. Lawsky also ordered the bank to bring in an outside consultant to monitor its transactions. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""Standard Chartered Bank operated as a rogue institution,"" Mr. Lawsky said in the order. ####  ##### In an unusual move, the regulator also found fault with an outside consultant—Deloitte L.L.P.—because the firm ""apparently aided"" the bank in its deception. ####  ##### A report by Deloitte ""intentionally omitted critical information"" when submitted to regulators, it said. ####  ##### Deloitte was hired to conduct a review after Standard Chartered in 2004 was ordered by New York and federal regulators to correct anti-money laundering lapses. ####  ##### The so-called ""look back"" review was supposed to identify suspicious transactions between 2002 and 2004. But at one point, Standard Chartered asked Deloitte to ""delete"" references to certain improper Iranian transactions, according to the New York order. ####  ##### In a subsequent email, a Deloitte partner said the firm had ""agreed"" to the request because it was ""too politically sensitive for both (Standard Chartered) and Deloitte. That is why I drafted the watered-down version."" In 2007, that report enabled Standard Chartered to show regulators it had corrected flaws in its anti-money laundering systems. ####  ##### In a statement on Monday, Deloitte said its financial advisory service division ""performed its role as independent consultant properly and had no knowledge of any alleged misconduct by bank employees. Allegations otherwise are unsupported by the facts."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky's investigation is extraordinary because probes into how banks carried out transactions tied to Iran primarily have been led by the district attorney's office in Manhattan and the U.S. Justice Department. ####  ##### His probe is another sign that the regulator intends to join the New York attorney general and Manhattan district attorney in being a top financial watchdog. The DFS was created last October, effectively assuming oversight of two former banking and insurance regulatory agencies that were abolished. ####  ##### Probes by the Manhattan district attorney and U.S. Justice Department date to 2006 and have targeted some nine banks. Barclays agreed to pay $298 million in 2010 after admitting it processed payments for clients tied to Cuba, Sudan and other countries. Lloyds and Credit Suisse agreed to pay settlements of $350 million and $536 million. ####  ##### In June, ING agreed to pay $619 million to settle allegations that it, too, violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran and other countries. It was the biggest fine levied against a bank for sanctions violations. ####  ##### The Justice Department, working with the FBI in New York, is also investigating Standard Chartered's activities for violations of U.S. sanctions. ####  ##### Standard Chartered, founded in 1853, is headquartered in London, but specializes in financing in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky said Standard Chartered moved money through its New York branch on behalf of Iranian financial clients, including the Central Bank of Iran and state-owned Bank Saderat and Bank Melli, that were subject to U.S. sanctions. ####  ##### Monday's order alleged that Standard Chartered removed codes on money transfers and altered message fields, inserting phrases such as ""NO NAME GIVEN"" to hide the nature of the transactions. ####  ##### At the center of concern were alleged ""U-Turn"" transactions, involving money moved for Iranian clients among banks in Britain and the Middle East and cleared through Standard Chartered's New York branch, but which “neither started nor ended in Institution,"" Mr. Lawsky said in the order. ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky's investigation is unusual because probes into banks' transactions tied to Iran have been primarily led by the district attorney's office in Manhattan and the U.S. Justice Department. #### "
"Marine insurance market conditions favorable despite losses: Marsh","Risk Management","Marsh & McLennan"," ##### Buyers of marine insurance experience favorable market conditions despite natural catastrophes and other significant losses, according to a Marsh Inc. report. ####  ##### Plentiful underwriting surpluses for marine risks and increased insurer competition have kept insurers from seeking premium increases, the New York-based brokerage said Monday in the report. ####  ##### A succession of natural catastrophes, including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the Thailand floods, among others, resulted in significant marine cargo claims, the New York-based brokerage said Monday in the report. ####  ##### In addition, the Costa Concordia shipwreck in January resulted in the largest claim for a single ship at $1 billion split between hull and liability underwriters, Marsh said. ####  ##### “Despite some significant losses in the market, competition remains strong and there currently is no expectation that the availability of marine insurance will decline in the near future,” said Marcus Baker, chairman of Marsh’s marine practice, in a statement accompanying the report. “Insurance buyers that can demonstrate that they have strong risk management practices in place may continue to secure rate reductions at the time they renew their insurance policies, though not to the same degree that they have in recent years.” ####  ##### Piracy still remains an area of risk for the marine industry, with the vast majority of ships now armed, the broker said. Claims resulting from piracy can be quite large, as pirates have become better organized and the cargo on a captured ship can easily exceed the value of the ship. ####  ##### Marsh’s full report is available here. #### "

"Court upholds FMLA retaliation award for employee","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### ST. LOUIS—An appellate court upheld a Family and Medical Leave Act retaliation award Tuesday, where the employer had terminated the worker shortly after she asked for the leave. ####  ##### According to the decision in Kathleen Marez vs. Saint-Gobain Containers Inc. by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, Ms. Marez took medical leave under the FMLA in July 2007 from the Muncie, Ind.-based firm. ####  ##### In January 2008, she told her supervisor she would require FMLA leave again for her husband's upcoming surgery. She was terminated two days later, with managers telling her it was because she had failed to follow company procedures. ####  ##### Ms. Marez sued, claiming retaliation in violation of the FMLA and gender discrimination. A jury returned a verdict in Ms. Marez' favor on the FMLA claim, but in Saint-Gobain's favor on the gender discrimination claim. ####  ##### On the FMLA claim, the jury awarded her $206,500 in damages and an another $206,500 in liquidated damages. The court also awarded her part of her requested attorneys' fees. Saint-Gobain appealed. ####  ##### Pointing out Ms. Marez's termination occurred less than 48 hours after the protected activity, the court said, “In considering whether temporal proximity alone can support an inference of causation, we have rarely been faced with two events so close in time.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The unanimous three-judge panel's ruling said, “Marez did not rely solely on the proximity of her termination to her notification to (her supervisor) that she would require FMLA leave. She presented evidence that one other production supervisor had committed the same error that she had, and other production supervisors had committed similar infractions, without being terminated or suffering other significant adverse consequences,” said the appellate court, in upholding the lower court. ####  ##### Commenting on the case, Jason Rossiter, an attorney with Zashin & Rich Co. L.P.A. in Cleveland, who was not involved in the case, said, “It's always a bit of danger to take some kind of an action against an employee who has done something that's protected.” ####  ##### In a situation like that, “you really need to get advice” from an attorney, who “can walk you through the process” to make sure you are not creating a wrong impression about what you are doing, Mr. Rossiter said. #### "

It is one of the largest settlements with any individual over activities linked to Mr. Madoff and his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities L.L.C. ####  ##### Citizens of New York do not deserve ""a jump start over all of the victims of this heinous fraud,"" Mr. Picard said in a court filing.

Such an outcome would be extraordinarily prejudicial to the creditors of the BLMIS estate."" ####  ##### Mr. Picard has been seeking more than $500 million from Mr. Merkin and his funds. ####  ##### Mr. Schneiderman had accused Mr. Merkin of ""recklessly"" feeding $2.4 billion from investors in his funds to Mr. Madoff, while falsely claiming that he had been actively managing the money. ####  ##### Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman, called Mr. Merkin's request for an injunction to block the Merkin accord ""inappropriate and without legal merit, and we will take all necessary steps to oppose it."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Mr. Merkin, said ""we are disappointed by Mr. Picard's efforts to interfere"" with the earlier settlement, and that his client will continue to defend against what he called Mr. Picard's ""meritless allegations."" ####  ##### Mr. Picard has largely been successful in stopping Madoff victims and people acting on their behalf from pursuing their own cases, though some litigation is still pending. ####  ##### Last month, he agreed to mediation for a dispute over a $270 million lawsuit by California Attorney General Kamala Harris against the widow of Beverly Hills money manager Stanley Chais over Mr. Chais' dealings with Mr. Madoff. ####  ##### The lawsuit against Mr. Schneiderman also names as defendants Mr. Merkin, his firm Gabriel Capital Corp., and receivers for his four private funds that invested with Madoff: Ariel Fund Ltd., Ascot Fund Ltd., Ascot Partners L.P. and Gabriel Capital L.P. ####  ##### Bart Schwartz, the receiver for the Ariel and Gabriel funds, said he will oppose any attempt to derail their ""fair, legal and binding"" settlement with Mr. Schneiderman.

It also awarded defendants summary judgment on the disparate treatment challenge to the 1998 test. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The appellate panel agreed with the district court in its 2-1 ruling. The district court heard extensive evidence as to how an independent state agency had determined, based on evidence drawn from fire departments across New York and the nation, that the job of fire lieutenant “involves common tasks requiring essentially the same skills, knowledge, abilities and personal characteristics” and “developed a general test based on those findings,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “The district court had sufficient evidence to make a preponderance finding that Buffalo's use of that test to promote fire fighters to the rank of fire lieutenant was job related and consistent with business necessity,” it said, in affirming the lower court's decisions. ####  ##### Previous cases ####  ##### Last year, the city of Chicago < a href=""/article/20110819/NEWS07/110819805"" target=""_blank"">paid $47 million to settle a lawsuit brought by black firefighters who alleged a 1995 test was discriminatory. ####  ##### In June 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court in  Frank Ricci et al. vs. John DeStefano et al. ruled in favor of 17 firefighters who sued New Haven, Conn.

Ms. Arney had shown the store manager a note from her doctor requesting an accommodation involving periodic breaks off her feet, but the manager refused to return her to her job and instead demanded that she obtain a medical release with no restrictions, according to the EEOC's statement. ####  ##### “The EEOC alleges that the medical restriction could have easily been accommodated by the giant retailer. In fact, had the employer inquired further, it would have learned that her need for accommodation was temporary,” said the agency, which charged Wal-Mart with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. ####  ##### In addition to $50,000 in back pay and damages, provisions of the settlement with Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and its Wal-Mart Stores East L.P. unit include that Wal-Mart conduct annual live ADA training of management officials at its Carlsbad store. ####  ##### Robert A.

"AIR Worldwide puts insured Isaac losses as high as $2 billion","Risk Management","Catastrophes, P/C Insurers"," ##### Hurricane Isaac caused insured damage estimated at $700 million to $2 billion to onshore U.S. properties, catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide Corp. said Friday. ####  ##### The estimate includes damage from wind and storm surge affecting onshore residential, commercial and industrial properties and their contents, automobiles as well as time-element coverage, which includes additional living expenses for residential properties and business interruption for commercial properties. ####  ##### AIR noted that initial reports of Isaac's damage focused on flooding, but wind damage has received less attention. ####  ##### “However, Isaac's slow forward speed and refusal to dissipate will exacerbate wind damage,” Tim Doggett, principal scientist at AIR, said in a statement. “As the winds persist, roof fasteners and connections can become fatigued and overloaded, causing additional damage, and the possibility of damage from flying building debris persists.” ####  ##### AIR also said it takes less wind to knock down trees due to the rain-saturated soil. ####  ##### The catastrophe modeler said it does not expect significant physical damage to offshore oil rigs and gas platforms from wind or waves. As a result of hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, business interruption coverage purchased by the energy industry is a “much rarer coverage than in years past,” AIR said. ####  ##### AIR said it does not expect significant insured losses to offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of Isaac. #### "
"Knight accepts Nasdaq's $62M Facebook payback plan","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters)—After heaping criticism on Nasdaq OMX Group's initial offer for compensating brokers for its botching of Facebook Inc.'s initial public offering, trading firm Knight Capital Group Inc. said it accepts the exchange's latest plan, which would pay out $62 million. ####  ##### The plan, which Nasdaq has called its ""definitive word"" on the Facebook debacle, is under consideration by the SEC and brings into question the extent to which an exchange can be liable for technical slip-ups. U.S. exchanges match hundreds of billions of dollars of securities transactions every day. ####  ##### Knight's support comes after Nasdaq increased the payback fund to $62 million in cash from an earlier $40 million, made up mostly of trading rebates, the market-making firm said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Aug. 29. ####  ##### Nasdaq has around 300 member firms that trade on the exchange. Knight and other retail market-making firms and brokers together lost more than $500 million in the IPO. ####  ##### Of the handful of comment letters on the compensation plan, two have voiced support: Knight's and hedge fund Citadel L.L.C.'s. Seven—from market makers, brokers, and lawyers for individual investors—have called for it to be rejected. ####  ##### ""Although we would have preferred that the accommodation pool cover all losses sustained by Nasdaq members, we do support Nasdaq's proposal,"" Knight said in the letter. ####  ##### Knight, which facilitates trades for other firms, had called Nasdaq's earlier plan ""inadequate,"" and said it was considering legal action over the Facebook IPO. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Liabilities at exchanges, which have some regulatory duties, are capped in most instances. Nasdaq's cap is $3 million. ####  ##### Much of the debate around the plan has focused on whether Nasdaq should be able to cloak itself in regulatory immunity in situations where it is operating as a for-profit entity. ####  ##### Facebook's eagerly anticipated IPO on May 18, which raised $16 billion, was initially delayed by 30 minutes due to a technical glitch at Nasdaq. ####  ##### The exchange then made the decision to get the stock trading by using a secondary system that ended up leading to delays in many clients orders and confirmations, costing some investors and traders big losses as the stock price dropped after an initial gain. ####  ##### UBS A.G., which disclosed it lost more than $350 million, and Citigroup's Automated Trading Desk, which is said to have lost up to $35 million, have argued that Nasdaq should be responsible for all of the losses because the decision to move forward with the IPO was a business decision made in haste. ####  ##### Further, Citi said trading of Facebook should not have been allowed to continue during the confusion that followed. ####  ##### But Knight, which said it lost more than $35 million in the IPO, urged the SEC to leave the discussion of liability limitations and regulatory immunity to another day. Citadel, which is said to have lost $20 million, made a similar request. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Knight did urge the SEC to reject a portion of Nasdaq's plan requiring firms that sign on to waive their right to sue the exchange, likely before they know how much they will be reimbursed. Knight said that would set ""a harmful precedent."" ####  ##### ""Setting forth those types of requirements in the context of a rule filing inappropriately mixes commercial issues with regulatory requirements,"" Knight said in the three-page letter also addressed to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. ####  ##### It said if the SEC disagrees and determines that some form of release is appropriate, it should only be sought after Nasdaq members are notified of the amount Nasdaq is willing to pay under the terms of the accommodation plan. ####  ##### A Nasdaq spokesman had no comment on Knight's letter. ####  ##### Nasdaq also faces regulatory investigations into its systems and actions during the IPO. ####  ##### Knight had its own trading glitch on Aug. 1, costing the firm $440 million and nearly forcing it into bankruptcy before a group of independent firms saved it with a $400 million investment. #### "
"Strategic risk management provides a competitive edge","Risk Management","Enterprise Risk Management"," ##### For companies that embrace the concept, strategic risk management provides a formal mechanism for addressing exposures that can threaten the execution of an organization's strategy, along with a tool for helping organizations exploit the opportunities that can be the flip side of risk. ####  ##### While some organizations might integrate strategic risk management into a broader enterprise risk management program, SRM is “a laser focus,” said Carol Fox, director of strategic and enterprise risk practice at the New York-based Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. That program concentrates on strategy planning and execution “in a very focused and disciplined way.” ####  ##### “It really is to physically focus on planning and strategic execution,” Ms. Fox said. ####  ##### Seeing a number of different definitions of strategic risk management and a lack of consistency in discussions of what it entailed, RIMS provided its own formal definition of SRM in 2011. According to RIMS' definition, strategic risk management “is a business discipline that drives deliberation and action regarding uncertainties and untapped opportunities that affect an organization's strategy and strategic execution.” ####  ##### Used effectively, strategic risk management can identify situations in which risk can be a competitive advantage instead of strictly a threat to a strategic plan. ####  ##### “As you go down that maturity, ultimately the goal is you want to include risk in your decision-making process, improving the way you make decisions and the speed at which you can make decisions,” said Steve Zawoyski, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Minneapolis. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In assessing their organizations' risks, some risk managers might tend to think, “If I start off with just hazards, I can move on to opportunities three years from now,” Mr. Zawoyski said. “Well, my caution is, if you only talk to people about hazards, all they think about is hazards.” ####  ##### Strategic risk management can be integrated into a wider enterprise risk management program, Ms. Fox said. “We would argue that all organizations should have an enterprise risk management umbrella,” she said. But, acknowledging that many organizations for whatever reason are likely not to move toward ERM, Ms. Fox said those organizations can still embrace SRM, “in this case specifically focusing risk management practices in a strategic way.” ####  ##### “Strategic risk management is an element and a necessary foundation for ERM,” said Mark L. Frigo, director of the Center for Strategy, Execution, and Valuation and the Strategic Risk Management Lab in the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business of DePaul University in Chicago. “It is often a missing element in existing ERM programs. And for organizations starting to develop ERM, it is a necessary foundation for building an effective and sustainable ERM program that creates as well as protects value.” ####  ##### Mr. Frigo said SRM requires thinking differently about risk and uncertainty. “There are a number of obstacles for developing SRM that need to be overcome,” he said. “One obstacle is overcoming the status quo way of thinking about risk management in the organization.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “The thing that needs to be clear from the outset is you're really partnering with those who have responsibility for strategy,” Ms. Fox said. “There are certain organizations where it might be seen as, 'We don't want to talk about risk because that's the downside.'” ####  ##### For strategic risk management efforts to succeed, the risk manager should be seen as a resource by those responsible for setting strategy, she said. “Helping them understand what's in it for them is probably the best approach,” she said. ####  ##### The interest in SRM at many organizations is driven by a realization that their ERM efforts were missing many strategic risks and a sense that much of their risk assessment wasn't “at the level needed to address risks that threaten organizations' survival,” said Rupak Mazumdar, senior manager, enterprise risk management at George Weston Ltd. in Toronto. ####  ##### At some organizations, “It's so difficult to put their hands around (strategic risks) in terms of these things happening that they omit them in their risk maps,” Mr. Mazumdar said. ####  ##### Also, some believe enterprise risk management is too focused on operations, Mr. Mazumdar said. “I think there are some in the ERM community who would say if you would have done it properly, you would have captured the strategic risks. There are others who say no,” he said. “I think it's a debate that's still occurring in the risk management community.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### DePaul's Mr. Frigo noted that ERM can take in a number of risks, some of which, while potentially harmful, don't threaten the organization's overall health or ability to meet its business objectives. However, recent events such as the 2008 financial market collapse and subsequent credit crisis offer examples of strategic risks that can threaten an organization's survival. ####  ##### “These more significant risk exposures have given rise to a focus on strategic risks and strategic risk management,” he said. ####  ##### Speaking to organizations' growing awareness of the need to address strategic risk, Marsh Inc.'s 2012 Excellence in Risk Management survey showed that 64% of C-suite and risk manager respondents listed a strategic view of risk and risk management's role as one of the top three abilities required to lead risk management. ####  ##### Asked how risks can be better integrated into their organization's strategic planning goals, 51% of C-suite survey respondents said by adopting a formal strategic risk management process, while 45% said by involving risk management in the early stages of strategic planning. ####  ##### “The good news is that many organizations are seizing the opportunities and integrate risk management deeply into their strategic planning,” said Brian Elowe, managing director in Marsh's global risk management division in Boston, during a June 20 webinar discussing strategic risk management. But other organizations have yet to do so, he said. ####  ##### George Weston's Mr. Mazumdar said he's still making up his mind about the need for a distinct SRM discipline in addition to ERM. “I can see the pros and cons of both,” he said. ####  ##### At present, George Weston is dealing with its strategic risks through its enterprise risk management process by making sure the ERM process is closely tied to the company's strategic planning process. “They're done in parallel,” Mr. Mazumdar said. ####  ##### “It's all in the execution,” he said. “Both ways can fall flat if you don't do it right.” ####  ##### This story is from the September 10, 2012, issue of the weekly print edition of Business Insurance, a special issue featuring how corporations and other entities are implementing strategic risk management. ####  ##### Copies of this issue, which includes a data poster featuring statistics on how SRM is being used, are available for $100 by contacting our Single Copy Sales department at 888-446-1422. ####  ##### To subscribe to Business Insurance to receive all future special print issues, click here. #### "

"Chinese drywall maker must face U.S. lawsuits: Judge","Risk Management","China, Construction"," ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. federal judge has ruled that a Chinese drywall maker must face claims over its allegedly tainted product, which has been blamed for causing foul odors, the failure of appliances and health problems. ####  ##### The ruling means homeowners will be able to pursue claims against the Chinese firm in U.S. courts, increasing the pressure for a settlement similar to that reached between plaintiffs and a German drywall maker last year. ####  ##### Judge Eldon Fallon of New Orleans on Monday denied motions by Taishan Gypsum Co. Ltd. to dismiss four lawsuits filed by homeowners whose properties were allegedly affected by faulty drywall. ####  ##### Judge Fallon also denied a request by Taishan to vacate a $2.6 million default judgment that he levied against the company in May 2010 after it had failed to make appearances in one of the cases. ####  ##### The ruling is the latest victory for plaintiffs in hundreds of drywall lawsuits that have been consolidated in New Orleans federal court. ####  ##### Last year, homeowners in the litigation settled with German company Knauf International over claims involving drywall manufactured by its Chinese subsidiary. As part of the settlement, funds were created to repair affected homes and compensate homeowners for economic losses and bodily harm. ####  ##### Russ Herman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he hoped that Judge Fallon's ruling would encourage Taishan to negotiate a similar settlement. ####  ##### After Judge Fallon entered the $2.6 million judgment against Taishan, the company's lawyers made appearances in the case and argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the company because of its lack of contacts with the United States. ####  ##### ""We believe that the Court was in error for all the reasons reflected in our papers and discussed at the hearing,"" said Joe Cyr, an attorney for Taishan. ####  ##### The consolidated cases are In Re: Chinese-Manufactured Drywall Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, No. 09-md-2047. #### "
"California hospital to pay $975,000 to settle racial harassment, discrimination case","Risk Management",""," ##### A California hospital has agreed to pay a $975,000 settlement in a harassment and discrimination case that alleged the employer created a hostile work environment for Filipino staff members. ####  ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center sued Delano, Calif.-based Delano Regional Medical Center in 2010 in U.S. District Court. The EEOC said the hospital's English-only language policy was used to harass and discriminate against Filipino employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The case involved claims from about 70 current and former Filipino employees who said they were taunted and threatened by non-Filipino employees for speaking Tagalog or other Filipino languages while working at Delano. ####  ##### In 2006, Delano's CEO and management held a meeting exclusively for Filipino and Filipino-American employees regarding the health system's English-only policy, according a statement Monday from the EEOC. The policy required workers to speak English at all times at work, except during breaks or while working with non-English-speaking patients. ####  ##### For years after that point, EEOC said that the hospital and its policy encouraged employees to act as ""vigilantes"" in reprimanding and reporting Filipino employees who spoke Tagalog or Ilocano on the job. While Filipino employees were disciplined for allegedly violating the language policy, the EEOC said that workers who spoke Spanish and other languages on the job were not disciplined. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Although language policies are not illegal, the EEOC contends that such rules must have a business justification and cannot be used to target specific workers, said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC District Office in Los Angeles. ####  ##### “Under federal law, the EEOC takes the position that if it's a draconian policy where you must speak English all the time, not exempting out down time or time on your own, that we believe is ... discriminatory,” she said during a press conference Monday. ####  ##### Elnora Cayme, a class member who spoke during the press conference, said she and other Filipino employees were harassed by co-workers and received complaints about their accents even while speaking English on the job. ####  ##### “I always felt like people were following and watching us,” she said. ####  ##### In addition to the settlement payment announced Monday, Delano entered into a three-year consent decree with the EEOC to develop anti-discrimination procedures. The health system also must hire an equal employment opportunity compliance monitor. #### "
"Family of bystander killed in St. Thomas gang violence can sue Carnival: Court ","Risk Management",""," ##### The family of a 15-year-old girl who was shot and killed by crossfire in a gang fight that broke out while she was on an excursion from a cruise ship can sue Carnival Corp. for negligence, a federal appeals court has ruled. ####  ##### According to the Sept. 5 ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami in Aida Esther Chaparro et al. v. Carnival Corp., Liz Marie Perez Chaparro was on a Caribbean cruise aboard a vessel of Miami-based Carnival with her family when she was killed. ####  ##### A male Carnival employee suggested to her father, Amilkar Perez Chaparro, that they visit Coki Beach and Coral World upon disembarking the ship in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. On July 12, 2010, Ms. Chaparro and her family left the ship and traveled to Coki Beach independently of the ship's sponsored excursions, court records state. ####  ##### On their way back, they rode in an open-air bus past a funeral of a gang member. Funeral attendees' cars were parked along the narrow road, blocking the passage of the bus. While the bus was stuck in traffic, shots broke out among gang members and Ms. Chaparro was hit. ####  ##### While bus passengers called for an ambulance, it did not arrive and the bus driver speeded to the hospital. Ms. Chaparro was declared dead from a gunshot wound to the abdomen shortly after arriving. ####  ##### Ms. Chaparro's parents and brother filed suit, accusing Carnival of negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress for failing to warn them about reported gang-related violence in the area. ####  ##### A lower court granted Carnival's motion to dismiss the case, saying the complaint's allegations were “conclusory and insufficiently factual.” ####  ##### However, a three-judge appeals court panel overturned that ruling. It said the complaint alleged that a Carnival employee encouraged the family to visit Coki Beach; that Carnival knew of the site's reputation for drug sales, theft and gang violence; and that it knew, or should have known, about the gang member's shooting and funeral because it monitors crime in its ports of call. ####  ##### “The facts alleged in the complaint are plausible and raise a reasonable expectation that discovery could supply additional proof of Carnival's liability,” the panel ruled in overturning the lower court's dismissal of the negligence claim. ####  ##### The panel also reinstated the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, noting the complaint alleges that the family was trapped in the bus during the violence, witnessed Ms. Chaparro's shooting and death, and that they have ""consequently experienced various physical manifestations of their emotional distress.” ####  ##### A Carnival spokeswoman said in an email that the company does not comment on pending litigation, but pointed to its statement after the shooting in which Carnival said it was “profoundly shocked and saddened by this tragedy.” #### "

"Verizon to pay more than $250M in TiVo settlement","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — TiVo Inc. will receive at least $250.4 million from Verizon Communications Inc. as part of a patent litigation settlement, the video recorder pioneer said Monday, sending its shares up more than 4%. ####  ##### TiVo, whose brand is synonymous with digital video recorders, has had to turn to litigation to generate revenue from licensing fees as it struggles to fight competition from low-cost rivals. ####  ##### Analysts said the Verizon settlement could bode well for a TiVo victory in cases against other companies, including Time Warner Cable Inc. and Motorola Mobility, which is now owned by Google Inc. ####  ##### The settlement, a big victory for TiVo, follows a similar deal it reached in January with AT&T Inc., which agreed to pay $215 million. ####  ##### TiVo also had prevailed in a similar case against Dish Network Corp. and EchoStar Corp. in May 2011. ####  ##### Regarding the ongoing cases, ""Verizon has set a strong precedent for Motorola to settle,"" Brean Murray analyst Todd Mitchell said. ####  ##### TiVo had sued Time Warner Cable in a lawsuit connected with the Motorola litigation, and Monday's settlement only improves the company's position, according to Lazard Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett. ####  ##### ""It also potentially sets the stage for a similar settlement with Time Warner Cable over the next year or so,"" Mr. Crockett said. ####  ##### Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Monday. Motorola Mobility was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### TiVo said Verizon would initially pay $100 million in cash and recurring quarterly payments totaling $150.4 million through July 2018. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### As part of the deal, the companies are discussing having TiVo boxes carry the new Internet video streaming service Verizon is developing with Coinstar Inc.'s Redbox to take on Netflix Inc. TiVo's DVRs already feature video services provided by Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. ####  ##### Besides the guaranteed compensation, Verizon will pay TiVo license fees on a monthly basis through July 2018 for each Verizon DVR subscriber above a certain agreed-upon number. ####  ##### If Verizon and TiVo pursue ""certain commercial initiatives"" by Dec. 21, up to $29.4 million of the payments made by Verizon would be subject to a credit of an equal amount, TiVo said. ####  ##### This probably refers to a nonexclusive deal for Verizon to offer TiVo boxes to customers, according to Mitchell, the Brean Murray analyst. Verizon declined comment on the settlement or future agreements, and it referred questions to TiVo. ####  ##### The companies also agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between them. ####  ##### TiVo shares rose 4.2% to $9.96 in morning trading, while Verizon was down 0.3% at $45.52. #### "

The company has begun operations or struck alliances in Australia, the Middle East and the U.K. during the past two years. ####  ##### Buying the stake in Amil gives UnitedHealth a chance to test a different model of medical service: Amil offers insurance coverage and also runs hospitals and doctor facilities. While some examples of this already exist in the United States, the largest U.S. insurance companies for the most part operate separately from networks of doctors and other health care providers. ####  ##### ""It's not something UnitedHealth has been willing to do here, but it gives them an opportunity to see how it works,"" said CRT Capital Group analyst Sheryl Skolnick.

"Insurer time-barred from subrogation claim against maker of defective airplane part","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### Too much time has elapsed for United States Aviation Underwriters Inc. to successfully pursue a subrogation claim against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective airplane component, said a federal appellate court in a ruling Tuesday. ####  ##### After an airplane was damaged in a 2009 runway accident, New York-based United States Aviation Underwriters indemnified the aircraft's owner and brought a subrogation claim against Tokyo-based Nabtesco Corp. and Nabtesco Aerospace Inc., according to the ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in United States Aviation Underwriters Inc. v. Nabtesco Corp. ####  ##### A key factor in the ruling is the http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20080120/ISSUE01/100023892 General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, which provides for an 18-year “statute of repose,” which is comparable to a statute of limitations. ####  ##### According to the ruling, on Aug. 17, 2009, a Cessna Citation 560 aircraft was damaged at an airport near Long Beach, Calif., when the nose landing gear collapsed during landing. The collapse allegedly was caused by a defect in the nose landing gear actuator, which is a motor used to extend and retract a plane's front wheels and shock absorbers during takeoff and landing. ####  ##### The actuator had been manufactured by Nabtesco in April 1990 and installed as a new original part on a Cessna 550 aircraft on Oct. 24, 1990. The Cessna was delivered to its first purchaser on Oct. 30, 1990, more than 18 years before the accident. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### At some point, the actuator was removed from the Cessna and installed on the plane that suffered the accident. That plane had been delivered to its first purchaser on Dec. 30, 1991, less than 18 years before the accident. ####  ##### U.S. Aviation filed a subrogation claim for an undisclosed amount against Nabtesco in 2010 for damage to the accident aircraft. It contended in its lawsuit that the date of delivery of the aircraft referred to in the General Aviation legislation refers to the delivery of the accident aircraft in December 1991, which was before the statute of repose expired. ####  ##### But the appellate court disagreed. ####  ##### “We hold that the statute is ambiguous as to whether 'aircraft' refers only to the indivisible delivered plane, or whether it is also includes by reference the component parts of the plane,” said the three-judge panel. ####  ##### “However, our analysis of the legislative history reveals that Congress intended for the latter definition to apply. Thus, under these circumstances, the 'date of delivery of the aircraft' points to the delivery date of the actuator to its first purchaser.” ####  ##### As a result, because the accident occurred after the statute of repose had run, the insurer's claim is barred, said the three-judge panel's ruling, in upholding a lower court's summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### A U.S. Aviation spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "

"OFF BEAT: Material Girl fights for rights to use Brando likeness","Risk Management",""," ##### Pop singer Madonna could end up paying more than $300,000 to use the likeness of Marlon Brando in one of her songs, according to a lawsuit filed by the deceased actor’s estate. ####  ##### During the performance of one of the pop star’s most popular songs, “Vogue,” during the Super Bowl halftime show last February, she dished out $3,750 to the estates of the many individuals mentioned in her song and used as “set dressings” during the performance. ####  ##### Some of the famous names in the song include James Dean, Jean Harlow, Grace Kelly, Joe DiMaggio and Mr. Brando, among others. ####  ##### Looking to go on tour in 2012, Madonna’s touring company, Bhakti Touring Inc., went to celebrity intellectual property clearinghouse CMG Worldwide Inc. to obtain the permission to use the dead stars’ property rights, including Mr. Brando’s, while on tour, according to court documents. ####  ##### CMG was able to negotiate a fee increase to $5,000 for each dead celebrity, including with Mr. Brando’s estate, Brando Enterprises L.P., which uses Brand Sense Partners L.L.C. as its agent. ####  ##### As a result of the deal, Bhakti Touring moved forward with plans to use the likenesses of the deceased personalities, after which Brand Sense Partners allegedly changed the terms of the deal, demanding to be paid $20,000, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### CMG filed a lawsuit in an Indiana district court in July against Brando Enterprises and Brand Sense Partners, alleging that the estate and its agent backed out of an enforceable contract. ####  ##### Last week, Brando Enterprises requested to move the lawsuit to federal court in Indianapolis citing “diversity jurisdiction,” according to court documents. ####  ##### “Despite the fact that plaintiff is asking the court to award it the Brando (intellectual property) rights for a mere $5,000, the true value of those rights in this litigation exceeds $300,000,” Brando Enterprises and Brand Sense Partners said in the notice of removal. ####  ##### The Material Girl might find it cheaper to use material of her own during concerts. #### "

"S&P downgrades long-term rating for Mapfre on Spain's fiscal woes","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Spain"," ##### Standard & Poor's Corp. on Tuesday downgraded its long-term rating for Majadahonda, Spain-based Mapfre S.A. insurance group to BBB+ from A-, a day after the ratings firm downgraded the sovereign debt of the Kingdom of Spain to BBB-/A-3 from BBB+/A-2. ####  ##### Peter McClean, London-based director for financial institutions ratings at S&P, said the catalyst behind the decision to downgrade Mapfre was the downgrade of Spain's sovereign debt and that the company's rating was subject to change in the event that the sovereign issue was somehow remediated. ####  ##### “If there is some more positive action on the sovereign debt, we would expect to see that reflected in the rating for Mapfre,” Mr. McClean said. ####  ##### The ratings release from S&P notes several positive financial performance indicators for Mapfre's individual business units. ####  ##### “The ratings on Mapfre's operating entities reflect our view of the group's strong operating performance; increasing geographic diversification, enhanced by leading positions in Spain and Latin America; and track record of good management,” the release states. “We consider these positive factors to be partially offset by the deteriorating credit quality of the investment portfolio, increasing country risk exposure, and weakening capital adequacy levels and quality.” ####  ##### Moreover, Spain's travails likely would not affect insurers domiciled in other parts of the European Union, Mr. McClean said. “This is very much driven by the downgrade on Spain. It doesn't have many implications for countries outside Spain,” he said. ####  ##### Federico Faccio, London-based senior director of insurance for Fitch Ratings Ltd., said the wider implications for insurers are largely on the asset side, as companies operating in the country are obliged to hold some Spanish sovereign debt. ####  ##### “If you look at domestic insurers in Spain, the exposure is high,” Mr. Faccio said. “If you look at more diversified groups, the magnitude of this downgrade of Spanish debt is not sufficient to warrant rating action.” ####  ##### Mr. Faccio also said that companies holding Spanish sovereign debt would need time to adjust their capital holdings. ####  ##### “Assets mixes can be adjusted but only to a certain extent,” he said. #### "

"ING to sell Malaysian insurance unit to AIA for $1.73B","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, AIG, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, China, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### (Reuters) — Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd. has agreed to buy ING Groep N.V.'s Malaysian insurance operations for $1.73 billion in cash, handing the Dutch financial services firm its first deal in a nine-month drive to sell off Asian assets. ####  ##### The sale of the Malaysian unit is expected to be followed soon by the divestment of ING's Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand units, as the bailed-out Dutch financial firm offloads assets to repay €10 billion ($12.89 billion) in state aid received during the 2008 financial crisis. ####  ##### For AIA, the purchase of the Malaysian operations marks its second M&A deal in less than a month and gives it a leading position in the fast-growing Southeast Asian economy. ####  ##### AIA was spun out of U.S. insurer American International Group Inc. in 2010 through a $20.5 billion initial public offering, and Hong Kong-based CEO Mark Tucker has been rebuilding the business after it lost agents and market share amid AIG's near-collapse during the financial crisis. ####  ##### ""It's a good deal, and they are paying up to buy a good-quality business and to expand into a rapidly growing market,"" said Credit Suisse Group analyst Arjan van Veen, describing ING's Malaysian business as the ""jewel in the crown."" ####  ##### AIA said it was paying a multiple of about 1.8 times embedded value for the Malaysian business, compared with AIA's own multiple of 1.5 times. Mr. van Veen said the deal should add 5% to AIA's earnings per share. ####  ##### Embedded value is a measure commonly used to gauge the value of insurance companies and includes the present value of future profit from long-term insurance contracts. ####  ##### The deal, which confirmed a report by Reuters on Wednesday, marks ING's first sale after it announced plans to auction its Asian insurance operations in January as part of a global asset sell-off program. ####  ##### ING originally wanted to sell its entire Asia insurance operation, with a book value of €6.1 billion ($7.86 billion), to one buyer but said it was willing to split up the business if it could raise more money that way. ####  ##### ""Today's announcement is the first major step in the divestment of our Asian insurance and investment management businesses and shows that ING continues to make steady progress in the restructuring of our company,"" said Jan Hommen, chief executive, in a statement. ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian operations attracted bidding interest due to the region's rapid growth potential. Life premiums in Malaysia are forecast to grow at 5.5% next year, compared with a world average of 3.7%, according to Swiss Re Ltd. estimates. ####  ##### The race to buy ING's Japan, Hong Kong and much smaller Thailand operations is still on, with Canada's Manulife Financial Corp. and Hong Kong business tycoon Richard Li in the running, a source told Reuters earlier. ####  ##### KB Financial Group is in advanced talks to buy ING's South Korean operations, sources have told Reuters. ####  ##### AIA said the Malaysian deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would boost its ranking in Malaysia to No. 1 by total premiums. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""ING's business in Malaysia represents an excellent strategic fit with AIA where we already have a well-established and strong business and the ability to integrate ING's businesses with our own,"" AIA CEO Mr. Tucker said in a statement. ####  ##### The deal also would strengthen AIA's bank distribution channel, an area analysts believe AIA needs to beef up. The acquisition will be funded through internal cash resources and debt financing, the statement said. ####  ##### AIA also announced a 22% rise in its value of new business to $300 million. ####  ##### Last month, AIA agreed to buy British insurer Aviva P.L.C.'s Sri Lankan operations for $109 million. ####  ##### ING's Malaysia business sells life, general and Islamic insurance products, and has about 1,200 employees and over 1.6 million customers. ####  ##### ING said it expects a net gain of about €780 million ($1.01 billion) from the transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013. #### "
"Baltimore County pension plan found to discriminate on age ","Risk Management","Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits"," ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has won summary judgment in its lawsuit against Baltimore County, Md., that alleged its pension plan is discriminatory based on age. ####  ##### The lawsuit, originally filed in 2007, claimed that Baltimore County's pension plan, known as the Employee Retirement System, violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act by requiring employees 40 years or older to pay higher pension contributions, the EEOC said in a statement Monday. ####  ##### In 2010, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., vacated an entry of summary judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Maryland, Northern Division, in Baltimore, in favor of Baltimore County. The appeals court sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether permissible financial considerations support the pension plan, according to court documents. ####  ##### U.S. District Court Judge Benson Everett Legg last week granted summary judgment against Baltimore County in favor of the EEOC, noting that Baltimore County failed to show financial considerations for requiring older employees to contribute more to the plan that were not based on age. ####  ##### “The county has come forward with no evidence demonstrating why two workers with the same number of years until retirement eligibility should be required to contribute to the ERS at different rates,” the judge wrote. ####  ##### ""The county made older employees pay more than younger employees for the same retirement benefits, without any financial justification,” said EEOC regional attorney Debra Lawrence, in the statement. “Older employees felt the impact of this discrimination in every paycheck.” ####  ##### In its official blog site, Baltimore County said the court’s ruling on age discrimination is wrong and would force employees to pay more, Baltimore County Budget and Finance Director Keith Dorsey wrote. ####  ##### “To put it simply, Baltimore County's retirement contribution schedule is not discriminatory, was negotiated by county labor groups, and is supported by years of sound actuarial studies,” Mr. Dorsey wrote. “For a court to attempt to force Baltimore County to raise the pension contributions for nearly 8,000 county employees retroactively is simply wrong, and the county will stand with its employees and fight this case until there is no one left to fight.” ####  ##### Baltimore County intends to “to vigorously pursue this case and are considering our legal options,” a spokeswoman said in an email. ####  ##### The next phase of litigation will determine damages, the EEOC said. #### "
"Expedia constructing worksite clinic at headquarters","Risk Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### Online travel company Expedia Inc. will offer its employees access to a new worksite clinic at its Bellevue, Wash.-headquarters beginning in January 2013, the company reported. ####  ##### The clinic is being constructed by Qliance Medical Management Inc., a Seattle-based health care firm that contracts with employers to provide primary care to employees and their dependents through its network of clinics. Employers pay Qliance a per-employee per-month fee ranging from $49 to $89 per month, depending on benefit plan members' ages. ####  ##### Qliance will provide Expedia, which self-insures health benefits for approximately 2,000 employees in the Puget Sound area, a customized primary health care solution including women's health services, pediatric care, urgent care, wellness education, ongoing chronic disease management, selected on-site procedures and diagnostics and coordination of all outside specialists and hospital care, according to Dr. Erika Bliss, Qliance president and CEO. ####  ##### The Expedia clinic also will be available to the public and other employers that would like to enroll their employees, Dr. Bliss said. ####  ##### “Employers are struggling to control health care costs. But they don't have a lot of leverage in the community with primary care providers and the rest of the health care system to drive change. If employers can't control the system, (with an on-site clinic) they can at least control the care that is provided within the four walls of their company,” Dr. Bliss said. ####  ##### Dr. Bliss said that when employees have immediate and convenient access to primary care through the workplace, they are less likely to need specialist and emergency room care, thereby lowering employers' health care expenditures. Qliance has saved self-insured businesses up to 30% of the cost of primary care using the clinic model, she said. ####  ##### The Expedia clinic will be the sixth opened by Qliance in Washington state. The company is looking to expand into at least two other states by the end of next year, according to Dr. Bliss. ####  ##### Expedia declined to comment. #### "

"Emergency room physician is independent contractor, cannot pursue bias claims: Court","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A “balance of factors” indicate an emergency room physician was an independent contractor and not an employee, and she therefore cannot pursue her discrimination claims, said a federal appellate court in a ruling Wednesday. ####  ##### Dr. Pooneh Hendi Glascock, a female physician of Iranian origin, had contracted with Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Linn County Emergency Medicine P.C. to provide emergency medical services at Mercy Medical Center in 2007, according to the ruling in Pooneh Hendi Glascock v. Linn County Emergency Medicine P.C. by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. ####  ##### The agreement with the physician group was to last one year and renewed for an additional year unless terminated by either party with 90 days' notice. It provided Dr. Glascock would be offered an ownership position in the firm after one year of satisfactory performance and upon approval by a majority of the firm's owners, said the ruling. ####  ##### The firm provided professional liability insurance for Dr. Glascock, but no benefits or vacation pay. It guaranteed 15 shifts per month and an hourly rate of $130, among other provisions, but gave the physician group no “control or direction over the method or manner” in which she performed her professional services and duties, the ruling said. ####  ##### Dr. Glascock charged that throughout her relationship with the group she was subjected to ongoing sexual harassment by other group physicians, including being called a “princess,” “cutie” and “babe,” as well as disparaging remarks about pregnancy. Group shareholders also allegedly made disparaging remarks about her national origin. ####  ##### At the end of her first year, the clinic's shareholders voted not to extend to her an ownership interest, but instead gave her a six-month probationary term. During the last week of her probationary term, she told the firm she was pregnant, and the shareholders subsequently voted to terminate her. ####  ##### Dr. Glascock filed suit against the group under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Iowa state law, charging discrimination on the basis of sex, pregnancy and national origin. A district court granted the group's motion to dismiss the case. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “To determine whether a hired individual is an employee or an independent contractor, we primarily consider whether the hiring party was able to 'control the manner and means by which a task is accomplished,'” said the 8th Circuit, in quoting the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 ruling in Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Darden. ####  ##### Although evidence supporting the issue of control is “inconclusive” in this case, though, a number of factors in the Darden case “support a conclusion that Glascock was an independent contractor,” said a three-judge panel. Among these was that she received no benefits from the group, paid her own self-employment taxes and was licensed at her own expense.” ####  ##### “Other factors which might favor employee status in this case are fewer in number and less in weight than those favoring independent contractor status,” said the court, in affirming the lower court's ruling dismissing the case. #### "

It’s not even past,” from his 1950 novel “Requiem for a Nun.” ####  ##### In the film, Owen Wilson’s character, a Hollywood screenwriter vacationing in Paris says: “The past is not dead! Actually, it’s not even past. You know who said that? Faulkner. And he was right. And I met him, too. I ran into him at a dinner party.” ####  ##### Charlotte, Va.-based Faulkner Literary Rights alleged copyright infringement on behalf of Sony Pictures, which did not receive permission to use Mr. Faulkner’s words before creating and distributing the film, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### The use of the quote “is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, and/or to deceive (the) film’s viewers as to a perceived affiliation, connection or association between William Faulkner and his works, on the one hand, and Sony, on the other hand,” according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### Sony Pictures reportedly called the lawsuit “frivolous” and will defend itself against the allegations. ####  ##### “There is no question this brief reference — 10 words — to a quote from a public speech Faulkner gave constitutes fair use and any claim to the contrary is without merit,” said Ann Boyd, senior vice president of global communications for Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., in news reports. ####  ##### Faulkner Literary Rights seeks compensatory damages and punitive damages, among others. ####  ##### Mr. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. #### "

Sonya Varnell and University of Southern Mississippi and Sonya Varnell v. Ged O'Connor was issued last week but announced Monday. ####  ##### Messrs. Vincent and Mollaghan had been women's soccer team coaches at the Hattiesburg, Miss.-based university, while Mr. O'Connor had been a graduate assistant coach. Ms. Varnell is the senior administrator for women's sports for the university. ####  ##### The three men had alleged violation of their due process, sexual harassment, gender discrimination and retaliation, and other charges under various federal and state laws. ####  ##### The men claimed that when Ms. Varnell and Richard Giannini, the university's then-athletic director and another defendant, were named to their positions in 1999, they made it clear they preferred women to coach women's sports. ####  ##### After players complained about the soccer program, Mr. Vincent was reassigned to a teaching position and Messrs. Mollaghan and O'Connor eventually accepted positions elsewhere. ####  ##### The three men filed suit, and a jury awarded Mr. Vincent $500,000, Mr. Mollaghan $376,000 and Mr. O'Connor $300,000 in 2008. ####  ##### The Mississippi Supreme Court held there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict in all three cases. ####  ##### The court's ruling included its analysis of incidents presented by Mr. O'Connor, where he said Ms. Varnell offered him a bed in his hotel and made a comment of “You're so nasty, you're so nasty” after he offered her part of his Subway sandwich. ####  ##### The court said the incidents could not be considered sexual harassment because neither “involved physically threatening conduct nor did they interfere with O'Connor's work performance.” ####  ##### It said also the bed offered by Ms. Varnell was an extra one, and the offer was made after “she heard other coaches teasing O'Connor about spending the night in a hotel room with another man they suspected to be homosexual.” #### "
"Retaliation verdict in HEI Hospitality age bias case upheld on appeal","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### An appellate court affirmed a jury's retaliation verdict against a hotel chain in a case brought by a former executive who was terminated three hours after the company learned he was charging the company with age discrimination, but it reduced the jury's damages award for emotional distress. ####  ##### According to Wednesday's decision by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston in Lawrence Trainor v. HEI Hospitality L.L.C., Mr. Trainor was hired by Norwalk, Conn.-based hotel investment group HEI in 2006, when he was 59. ####  ##### At the time he was hired, Mr. Trainor balked at the firm's requirement that he relocate to Norwalk, Conn., from his Marshfield, Mass., home because of his wife's health. Under a compromise reached at the time, he would spend Mondays and any other days when his presence was needed in Norwalk, and travel to properties that demanded his attention during the rest of the week. ####  ##### In 2008, a new senior vice president of operations was named, and top executives “received an adjuration about a perceived need to relocate to Norwalk,” said the ruling. Mr. Trainor was offered a choice between relocating to Norwalk or becoming a general manager at a lower salary at a Cambridge, Mass., hotel. Negotiations ensued, in which the hotel agreed to give Mr. Trainor a salary higher than the one initially offered if he took the hotel position, but still below his current salary. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On Dec. 4, 2008, his attorney wrote the firm, suggesting it was guilty of age discrimination. On Jan. 2, 2009, Mr. Trainor filed an age discrimination charge with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. He was terminated three hours after the firm was notified of the charge, according to the court ruling. ####  ##### During an eight-day trial, the hotel chain contended the decision to terminate Mr. Trainor's position had been made before Dec. 4. But in April 2011, a jury found HEI liable for retaliation, although not for age discrimination, and awarded Mr. Trainor $500,000 in back pay, $750,000 in front pay and $1 million for emotional distress. The district court reduced the emotional distress award to $500,000. ####  ##### Because the jury determined HEI had knowingly violated state law, the district court entered an order doubling the emotional distress award to $1 million. ####  ##### A three-judge appellate court refused to overturn the liability finding. The court said there was “no smoking gun.” But the “close temporal proximity” between the firm's receipt of the Massachusetts Commission's charge and Mr. Trainor's dismissal “itself supports an inference of retaliation,” said the court. “Because the record supports conflicting versions of the truth, it became the jury's function — not the court's” to choose between the versions of what occurred, the ruling said. ####  ##### However, the appellate court held the basic damages award was excessive. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The ruling said Mr. Trainor and his wife reported that he became withdrawn and had lost interest in activities that had formerly given him pleasure after he was fired. But Mr. Trainor “did not introduce any evidence that he received medical treatment, counseling or other similar attention for his despondency,” the court said. ####  ##### “We do not mean to minimize the toll that the loss of a job can take, even apart from serious health concerns,” said the ruling. “Here, however, the evidence of emotional distress is so thin that the remitted award of $500,000 seems vastly out of proportion,” said the court, which reduced the basic emotional distress award to $200,000. ####  ##### The case was remanded to the district court with directions to vacate the $500,000 award for emotional distress and order a new trial on the issue, unless Mr. Trainor agreed to accept the $200,000 award. ####  ##### Observers have said it is not uncommon for plaintiffs to win retaliation cases, but not on the initial underlying discrimination charge. #### "

(Group) of China, one of China's largest insurers, is tapping the Hong Kong equity market at a time when IPO volumes in the financial center have tumbled more than 80%. PICC will be the biggest Hong Kong IPO since another insurer, AIA Group Ltd., raised $20.5 billion in 2010. ####  ##### The company secured $1.85 billion in commitments from 17 cornerstone investors as varied as Chinese utility State Grid Corp, the country's leading gold miner Zijin Mining Group, defense contractor Spacechina and China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., the sources said. ####  ##### So-called cornerstone investments in IPOs are unique to Asia, where large and well-established investors are guaranteed big allotments in return for holding their shares for a certain period of time, giving investors confidence in the deal. ####  ##### U.S. insurer AIG was added to the list of cornerstone investors who initially signed up, pledging $500 million to the IPO, sources said. It was unclear what caused the delay, but one source had earlier said AIG had dropped out due to valuation issues. AIG was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The list is still subject to last-minute changes, sources said. ####  ##### ""The seller (PICC) is pushing the envelope on valuations,"" one of the sources added. ####  ##### French reinsurer Scor S.E. and Tokio Marine Holdings are among the global companies committed to buy PICC shares. Scor could not be reached immediately for comment.

"Sports fans can pursue U.S. antitrust case over programs","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — A federal judge on Wednesday allowed sports fans to pursue a lawsuit accusing Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and various networks of antitrust violations in how they package games for broadcast on television or the Internet. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan said the subscribers could pursue claims that the packaging has reduced competition, raised prices, and kept them from watching their favorite teams located outside their home markets. ####  ##### ""Plaintiffs in this case — the consumers — have plausibly alleged that they are the direct victims of this harm,"" she wrote. ####  ##### The defendants include Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, several teams in both sports, cable TV company Comcast Corp., satellite TV provider DirecTV, Madison Square Garden Co. and some regional sports networks. ####  ##### DirecTV declined to comment, saying it had not reviewed the decision. Comcast and the NHL had no immediate comment. Other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### Michael Buchman, a lawyer representing subscribers, was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### Media companies, leagues and teams can often justify higher costs to watch their products by citing the higher costs of doing business, and that individual teams have rabid followings among viewers willing to pay more to watch events live. ####  ##### The case arose from what the subscribers said were anticompetitive ""blackout"" agreements between service providers such as Comcast and DirecTV, sports networks and the leagues. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### These subscribers contended that if they wanted to watch games from outside their home markets, they were required to buy packages that included all out-of-market games, even if they were interested only in one or a few nonlocal teams. ####  ##### For example, a New York Yankees fan living in Colorado could not pay simply for access to that team's games, but had to buy a product such as the MLB Extra Innings television package. ####  ##### The subscribers sought damages and a halt to arrangements that they said resulted in ""reduced output, diminished product quality, diminished choice and suppressed price competition."" ####  ##### Other packages at issue are NHL Center Ice for television, and MLB.tv and NHL GameCenter LIVE for the Internet. ####  ##### The defendants argued that the subscribers' alleged injuries were only indirectly related to the alleged wrongful conduct, and that Major League Baseball and NHL games did not qualify as ""distinct products"" subject to antitrust scrutiny. ####  ##### Comcast, DirecTV and the sports networks also contended that their conduct was ""presumptively legal."" ####  ##### Judge Scheindlin nonetheless let much of the case go forward. ####  ##### ""Making all games available as part of a package, while it may increase output overall, does not, as a matter of law, eliminate the harm to competition wrought by preventing the individual teams from competing to sell their games outside their home territories in the first place,"" she wrote. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The judge did dismiss claims that Comcast, DirecTV and the sports networks conspired to monopolize markets, while allowing similar claims against Major League Baseball and the NHL to proceed. She also dismissed some individual plaintiffs from the case, saying they lacked standing to sue. ####  ##### ""There will be pressure on the defendants to settle before this gets to trial,"" which could cost ""real money,"" said Geoffrey Rapp, a University of Toledo law professor in Ohio. ####  ##### ""The defendants are in some ways similar to record companies that had to adapt as a la carte options became available online, where people could buy one song rather than a whole album,"" he said. ""Five or 10 years from now, these package-deal arrangements may no longer exist."" ####  ##### Among the dozens of defendants were the Yankees and its YES network; the Chicago White Sox baseball and Chicago Blackhawks hockey teams; the New York Rangers hockey team; and various Comcast SportsNet and RootSports networks. ####  ##### Last month, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it would buy a 49% stake in the YES network. ####  ##### Baseball itself has had an antitrust exemption since 1922, but has long faced periodic calls from Congress and elsewhere that it be repealed. ####  ##### The cases are Laumann et al v. National Hockey League et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-01817; and Garber et al. v. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball et al. in the same court, No. 12-03074. #### "

"Strike settlement to reopen Los Angeles ports to normal freight traffic","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — The United States' largest cargo shipping complex was set to resume full operations on Wednesday after harbor clerks and management settled an eight-day strike that left the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach mostly idle, sapping the region's economy of an estimated $8 billion. ####  ##### The striking clerks reached a tentative contract deal with a group of shippers and terminal operators late Tuesday, with prodding from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a onetime labor activist. ####  ##### Officials for the International Longshore and Warehouse Workers Local 63 said the hundreds of clerical employees who walked off the job Nov. 26, and the thousands of longshoremen who had refused to cross their picket lines, would return to work first thing Wednesday morning. ####  ##### Federal mediators called upon to join negotiations at the mayor's behest showed up at the waterfront community center where talks were being held shortly before the mayor announced the settlement. ####  ##### ""Today, the ILWU voted to approve the contract,"" Mr. Villaraigosa said, standing with smiling members of both negotiating teams. ####  ##### Union officials said they expected the rank and file, who have been without a contract for more than two years, to ratify the new agreement. ####  ##### Details of the pact were not immediately made public. But the mayor and ILWU representatives said the two sides had come to terms on the union's chief concern — control over outsourcing, or the transfer of jobs to workers elsewhere for less pay. ####  ##### What direct role, if any, the mediators played in clinching the deal was unclear. But Mr. Villaraigosa said a key breakthrough came when the union, which had resisted outside intervention, joined management on Tuesday morning in consenting to mediation as a way of spurring the stalled talks. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### At that point, Mr. Villaraigosa told Reuters, ""The employers said, 'Why don't we just do this today,'"" which led to the final round of negotiations and a deal. ####  ##### The union earlier credited the mayor with helping the parties narrow their differences during a marathon bargaining session the night before. ####  ##### The strike cost Southern California, a region still struggling to recover from a prolonged economic slump, an estimated $1 billion a day, including lost wages and the value of cargo rerouted to other ports, the mayor said. ####  ##### It marked the worst cargo traffic disruption at Los Angeles and Long Beach — which together account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. container imports — since a 10-day lockout of longshoremen at several West Coast ports in 2002. ####  ##### The latest dispute forced a shutdown at 10 of the twin ports' 14 container terminals, as some 10,000 longshoremen and other union workers honored the picket lines of the 800-member ILWU clerical workers unit. ####  ##### Four other container terminals remained open, along with facilities for handling shipments of automobiles, liquid fuels and break-bulk cargo such as raw steel. ####  ##### Still, at least 18 freighters bound for Los Angles and Long Beach during the strike changed course to take their cargo to ports in Northern California, Mexico and Panama, according to the nonprofit Maritime Exchange of Southern California. The diverted cargo heightened concerns about the region losing business to competing ports. ####  ##### Many other cargo-laden vessels were forced to line up for days at offshore anchorages, waiting to unload their containers. ####  ##### The chief stumbling block throughout contract negotiations was disagreement over future staffing levels and continued union classification of jobs lost to retirement or other attrition. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Under the agreement, Mr. Villaraigosa told Reuters: ""The employers are not going to outsource."" ####  ##### Union spokesman Craig Merrilees said: ""Really, it was getting control on the outsourcing ... ensuring that the jobs are here today, tomorrow and for the future."" ####  ##### Stephen Berry, chief negotiator for the Harbor Employers Association, representing shippers and terminal operators at the talks, hailed the settlement as ""the end of a very long journey. We're delighted with the terms. We'll be operating again and the cargo will be flowing."" ####  ##### During the dispute, the employers had accused union negotiators of seeking to ""featherbed"" the ranks of clerical workers with more jobs than were necessary. ####  ##### Unlike the labor clash at West Coast ports a decade ago, which took place in the fall, the latest dispute unfolded after the busy pre-holiday shipping season, limiting the scope of its ripple effect. ####  ##### Many major U.S. retailers said they were largely spared any pain from the labor clash because most of their Christmas inventory had already made it to store shelves. ####  ##### But the National Retail Federation asked President Barack Obama last week to intervene, warning a prolonged strike could have a ""devastating impact on the U.S. economy."" ####  ##### The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together handled more than $400 billion in goods arriving or leaving the West Coast by ship last year. Experts say the ports directly or indirectly support 1.2 million Southern California jobs — workers involved in moving freight to or from the shipping complex. #### "
"Insurer not obligated to defend in false marketing suit","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers"," ##### A federal appeals court affirmed that a sporting goods company's costs in an underlying false marketing lawsuit are excluded from personal and advertising injury coverages within its general liability policy under the failure-to-conform exclusion. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled unanimously that Cannon Falls, Minn.-based Robinson Outdoors Inc. was not entitled to defense and indemnification costs under its insurance policies from its insurer, Westfield Center, Ohio-based Westfield Insurance Co. ####  ##### Robinson Outdoors marketed and sold hunting-related clothing that would eliminate human scent so that wild game would not detect a hunter's presence. In 2009, the company was hit with class action lawsuits by consumers who had purchased the scent-masking products alleging that the products did not actually eliminate human odor as advertised. ####  ##### A lower court determined that Robinson Outdoors' claims in the underlying lawsuits were excluded by the “failure-to-conform” provision within its advertising injury coverage, which excluded claims “arising out of the failure of goods, products or services to conform with any statement of quality or performance made in (Robinson's) policies,” according to court documents. ####  ##### On appeal, Robinson Outdoors argued that the exclusion was vague. But the three-judge panel said neither the court nor Robinson Outdoors could articulate multiple interpretations of the failure-to-conform exclusion. ####  ##### “Rather, the exclusion clause directly applies to Robinson's conduct — Robinson marketed goods and was then sued because the goods did not conform to promises regarding their performance,” according the opinion. ####  ##### “The failure-to-conform provision in the insurance polices precludes coverage in this case because it captures all of the legal claims asserted by the consumers in the underlying lawsuits,” the Circuit Judge Bobby Shepherd wrote in the opinion filed Friday. “Therefore, the district court correctly held that Westfield was under no obligation to defend or indemnify Robinson in the underlying lawsuits.” #### "

"Female shareholders file class action gender bias lawsuit against Greenberg Traurig","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A putative class action lawsuit was filed Monday against international law firm Greenberg Traurig L.L.P. by current and former female shareholders charging the firm with gender discrimination. ####  ##### The lawsuit, Francine Friedman Griesing v. Greenberg Traurig L.L.P., which was filed by New York-based plaintiff law firm Sanford Heisler L.L.P. in federal district court in New York, seeks $200 million. There are about 215 women in the class, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### It says that the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in June found “reasonable cause to believe” New York-based Greenberg Traurig discriminated against its female attorneys in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act by compensating women less than similarly situated male counterparts and treating class members less favorably than similarly situated male shareholders. ####  ##### The lawsuit states the “glass ceiling remains firmly in place at large law firms,” with a recent American Bar Association study of nationwide law firms finding female attorneys comprise 45% of law firm associates but only 15% of equity partners. It notes that at Greenberg Traurig, the title “shareholder” is the equivalent to the title “partner” at other firms. ####  ##### “Yet even in a field dominated by archaic gender stereotypes, (Greenberg Traurig) stands out for its culture of discrimination against female attorneys,” says the lawsuit, which states only 9.6% of its equity shareholders are female, well below the 15% national average, and the firm ranks 193 out of 221 top law firms in the number of female equity partners, according to a study. ####  ##### The law firm said in a Monday statement, “The lawsuit filed today by Francine Griesing and her attorneys is an affront to the accomplished, talented women of Greenberg Traurig, who, like all of our lawyers, are compensated based on merit. It is nothing more than a financially motivated publicity stunt without merit, backed by neither fact nor law. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Griesing's complaint paints a false picture of the work environment at Greenberg Traurig and the facts surrounding her initial claim to the EEOC. What her press release calls 'the EEOC's rare finding of class-wide discrimination at the firm' were in fact very narrow findings limited to one office and seven women, in a setting in which Ms. Greising was the sole complainant. ####  ##### “Griesing refused to submit her claim to arbitration as required by the firm's shareholder agreement and instead filed in federal court.  Accordingly, today the firm filed a petition in federal court in Philadelphia to compel arbitration. ####  ##### “Greenberg Traurig has an exemplary record of fairness and advancement irrespective or gender, race or creed. Our history of recruiting, retaining, and promoting women and our law firm reflects that. The firm intends to vigorously defend our practices against her lawsuit and we fully expect to prevail.” #### "
"Dillard's to pay $2M to settle class action disability bias lawsuit ","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### National retail chain Dillard's Inc. has agreed to pay $2 million to settle a class action disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ####  ##### The settlement resolves a 2008 lawsuit filed against the Little Rock, Ark.-based retailer for allegedly using a longstanding national policy and practice of requiring all employees to disclose personal and confidential medical information to obtain sick leave, the EEOC said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### The settlement also resolves allegations that Dillard's terminated employees for taking sick leave beyond the maximum amount of time allowed. ####  ##### In the suit, the EEOC alleged that since 2005 Dillard's violated Americans with Disabilities Act by requiring former cosmetics counter employee Corina Scott at a store in El Centro, Calif., and others, to disclose the exact nature of their medical conditions to be approved for sick leave. ####  ##### Ms. Scott, who was absent from work for four days, and others, subsequently were fired in retaliation for refusing to provide details of their medical conditions, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. ####  ##### The EEOC also claimed Dillard's enforced a maximum-leave policy that limited the amount medical-related leave an employee could take without regularly determining if more leave was allowed under the ADA. ####  ##### The district court ruled that Dillard's medical disclosure policy was “facially discriminatory under the ADA,” the EEOC said in the statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Policies and practices that permit medical inquiries without proof of a valid business necessity run afoul of the law, often having large-scale consequences,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles district office, in the statement. “All employers should carefully examine their own policies and practices to ensure compliance with federal law."" ####  ##### Dillard's agreed to pay $2 million to identified claimants and establish a class fund for unidentified claimants. The agreement also requires Dillard's to review and revise company policies, according to the statement. ####  ##### The two policies that allegedly violated the ADA are not in effect and the company denies that either policy violated the law, Dillard's said in a separate statement Tuesday. ####  ##### “However, in order to avoid further protracted litigation with the EEOC over policies that are no longer in effect, Dillard's determined that the most efficient resolution was to settle with the EEOC,” the company said in the statement. “Under the settlement the company agreed to not reinstate the policies at issue as well as to other injunctive relief, and to establish a class fund from which current and former associates who believe they were adversely affected by the policies can make a claim.” #### "
"Pfizer to pay $55 million to settle Protonix case","Risk Management","Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### (Reuters) — Pfizer Inc. will pay $55 million plus interest to settle charges that Wyeth promoted its acid reflux drug Protonix for unapproved uses and made unproven claims about the medicine, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday. ####  ##### The infractions took place between February 2000 and June 2001, long before the world's largest drugmaker acquired Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion. Protonix, which belongs to a class of widely used medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPI), has since gone off patent and is available in cheap generic versions as pantoprazole. ####  ##### Protonix was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis, a condition related to gastro-esophageal reflux disease, or GERD, that can only be diagnosed via endoscopy. ####  ##### The Justice Department accused Wyeth of training its sales force to promote Protonix for all forms of GERD, which is far more common and likely to lead to significantly higher sales. ####  ##### ""Wyeth tried to cheat the system by obtaining a limited FDA approval for Protonix, fully intending to promote this drug for additional, unapproved uses,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a statement. ####  ##### In addition, Wyeth allegedly promoted Protonix as the ""best PPI for nighttime heartburn,"" even though there was never any clinical evidence that it was more effective than any other PPI, such as AstraZeneca's Nexium, for that use, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### Pfizer issued a statement saying that it was not the target or subject of this case, but felt that settling it was in its best interest. ####  ##### ""Resolving this investigation regarding Wyeth's historical promotional practices of Protonix is the right thing to do,"" the company said. ""In settling, we avoid both the cost and distraction of litigation and we expressly deny the allegations of wrongdoing."" #### "
"KBW predicts modest rate increases for P/C insurers in 2013","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### Modest rate increases but little improvement in underlying underwriting profitability are likely to continue for the property/casualty insurance industry in 2013, according to an analysis released Wednesday by Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. ####  ##### The industry remains overcapitalized despite increased shareholder dividends, share repurchases and increased catastrophe losses, said KBW in “2013 Outlook: More of the Same, Slow Firming Continues.” The report added that KBW expects investment results to be under pressure for the foreseeable future, and “while underlying underwriting results may slowly improve going forward due to modest rate increases that are in excess of loss costs trends, we expect favorable prior-year reserve development to wane.” ####  ##### The report says the “long-sought-after hard market will remain elusive” until excess capital is eliminated and insurers face balance sheet pressure. While the current firming “should keep things heading in the right direction,” the industry would have to experience significant balance sheet erosion before the market truly hardens. ####  ##### The report also says underwriting is key to insurers' success in the current environment. “Strong underwriters are able to generate good results regardless of where we are in the underwriting cycle,” said KBW. #### "

"HSBC to pay $1.9B U.S. fine in money-laundering case","Risk Management","United Kingdom"," ##### (Reuters) — HSBC Holdings P.L.C. has agreed to pay a record $1.92 billion fine to settle a multiyear probe by U.S. prosecutors, who accused Europe's biggest bank of failing to enforce rules designed to prevent the laundering of criminal cash. ####  ##### The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday charged the bank with failing to maintain an effective program against money laundering and conduct due diligence on certain accounts. ####  ##### In documents filed in federal court in Brooklyn, it also charged the bank with violating sanctions laws by doing business with Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba. ####  ##### HSBC admitted to a breakdown of controls and apologized for its conduct. ####  ##### ""We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so again. The HSBC of today is a fundamentally different organization from the one that made those mistakes,"" said Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver. ####  ##### ""Over the last two years, under new senior leadership, we have been taking concrete steps to put right what went wrong and to participate actively with government authorities in bringing to light and addressing these matters."" ####  ##### The bank agreed to forfeit $1.256 billion and retain a compliance monitor to resolve the charges through a deferred-prosecution agreement. ####  ##### The settlement offers new information about failures at HSBC to police transactions linked to Mexico, details of which were reported this summer in a sweeping U.S. Senate probe. ####  ##### The Senate panel alleged that HSBC failed to maintain controls designed to prevent money laundering by drug cartels, terrorists and tax cheats, when acting as a financier to clients routing funds from places including Mexico, Iran and Syria. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The bank was unable to properly monitor $15 billion in bulk cash transactions between mid-2006 and mid-2009, and had inadequate staffing and high turnover in its compliance units, the Senate panel's July report said. ####  ##### HSBC on Tuesday said it expected to also reach a settlement with British watchdog the Financial Services Authority. The FSA declined to comment. ####  ##### U.S. and European banks have now agreed to settlements with U.S. regulators totaling some $5 billion in recent years on charges they violated U.S. sanctions and failed to police potentially illicit transactions. ####  ##### No bank or bank executives, however, have been indicted, as prosecutors have instead used deferred prosecutions — under which criminal charges against a firm are set aside if it agrees to conditions such as paying fines and changing behavior. ####  ##### HSBC's settlement also includes agreements or consent orders with the Manhattan district attorney, the Federal Reserve and three U.S. Treasury Department units: the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ####  ##### HSBC said it would pay $1.921 billion, continue to cooperate fully with regulatory and law enforcement authorities, and take further action to strengthen its compliance policies and procedures. U.S. prosecutors have agreed to defer or forego prosecution. ####  ##### The settlement is the third time in a decade that HSBC has been penalized for lax controls and ordered by U.S. authorities to better monitor suspicious transactions. Directives by regulators to improve oversight came in 2003 and again in 2010. ####  ##### Last month, HSBC told investors it had set aside $1.5 billion to cover fines or penalties stemming from the inquiry and warned that costs could be significantly higher. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Analyst Jim Antos of Mizuho Securities said the settlement costs were ""trivial"" in terms of the company's book value. ####  ##### ""But in terms of real cash terms, that's a huge fine to pay,"" said Mr. Antos, who rates HSBC a ""buy"". ####  ##### ""It has been damaging for the brand, albeit not as bad as it might have been,"" said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec Securities in London. ####  ##### ""Is it absorbable? Yes. Is it significant? Yes. But in the absence of a broader attack on the business structure or individuals, that explains why the market reaction has been relatively muted today and has been since the allegations came out,"" he added. ####  ##### HSBC said it had increased spending on anti-money laundering systems by around nine times between 2009 and 2011, exited business relationships and clawed back bonuses for senior executives. It cited the hiring last January of Stuart Levey, a former top U.S. Treasury Department official, as chief legal officer as evidence of its determination to change. ####  ##### Under a five-year agreement with the Justice Department, HSBC agreed to have an independent monitor evaluate its progress in improving its compliance. ####  ##### It also said that as part of the overhaul of its controls, it has launched a global review of its ""Know Your Customer"" files, which will cost an estimated $700 million over five years. The files are designed to ensure that banks do not unwittingly act as conduits for criminal funds. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### HSBC's settlement comes a day after rival British bank Standard Chartered P.L.C. agreed to a $327 million settlement with U.S. law enforcement agencies for sanctions violations, a pact that follows a $340 million settlement the bank reached with the New York bank regulator in August. ####  ##### Such settlements have become commonplace. In what had been the largest settlement until this week, ING Bank N.V. in June agreed to pay $619 million to settle U.S. government allegations that it violated sanctions against countries including Cuba and Iran. ####  ##### Other banks that have reached settlements over sanctions violations are Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group, Britain's Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays P.L.C., and ABN Amro Holding N.V., a Dutch bank acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland Group P.L.C. and a bank consortium in 2007. ####  ##### In the United States, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wachovia Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have been cited for anti-money laundering lapses or sanctions violations. ####  ##### HSBC's failings date to 2003, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and New York state regulators ordered it to better monitor suspicious money flows. In 2010, a consent order from the Comptroller of the Currency ordered HSBC to review suspicious transactions. At the time, the OCC called HSBC's compliance programe ""ineffective."" ####  ##### In 2008, the U.S. Attorney in Wheeling, W.Va., began investigating allegations that a local doctor used the bank to launder money from Medicare fraud. ####  ##### Ultimately, that prosecutor's office came to believe the case was ""the tip of the iceberg"" in terms of suspicious transactions conducted through HSBC, according to documents reviewed by Reuters and reported earlier this year. #### "

Ford replaced 13 million Firestone tires, installed mostly as original equipment on the company's popular Explorer SUV, in one of the biggest recalls in U.S. history. ####  ##### Hagens Berman, the law firm representing Toyota owners who brought the lawsuit in 2010, issued a statement saying that the settlement was valued between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In a memo filed in court, the lawyers said the settlement was ""a landmark, if not a record, settlement in automobile defect class action litigation in the United States."" ####  ##### Toyota said it would take a one-time pretax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the costs. The company said it planned to book the charge as operating expenses in its October-December third quarter. ####  ##### ""This is positive, as it removes the factor that was the biggest concern when it came to lawsuits ... Because Toyota's absolute numbers are very big when it comes to profits, it's hardly going to have an impact,"" said Koji Endo, an autos analyst at Advanced Research in Tokyo. ####  ##### Toyota may be able to offset costs with a rise in its profits as the yen weakens, he added. Toyota's operating profit increases by 35 billion yen for every one-yen rise in the value of the dollar. The automaker has forecast an operating profit of 1.05 trillion yen ($12.3 billion) for the financial year ending in March 2013. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Toyota shares rose 2.7%, compared with a 1% rise in Japan's benchmark Nikkei index. ####  ##### Toyota's recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011 hurt the company's reputation for reliability and safety. ####  ##### The effect of the recalls on sales and loyalty remains ""difficult to isolate,"" IHS Automotive analyst Rebecca Lindland said. ####  ##### ""A lot of their growth through the early 2000s were first-time Toyota buyers,"" she said. ""Those are the people that were most vulnerable to saying, 'I'll never own a Toyota again.' The long-term effects won't fully be realized until all of the cars that have been impacted by the recall have been retired."" ####  ##### The biggest safety crisis in Toyota's history began to get public notice in August 2009 when an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer Mark Saylor and three members of his family were killed in a Lexus ES 350 that crashed at a high speed. ####  ##### A separate lawsuit over the death of the Saylor family was settled out of court. A handful of wrongful death and personal injury cases are still pending, but the vast majority of the litigation over unintended acceleration will be finished if the proposed settlement is approved, said a person with knowledge of the remaining lawsuits who wished to remain anonymous. ####  ##### Within a half year of the Saylor family crash, Toyota President Akio Toyoda and other company executives were questioned in a high-profile U.S. Congressional hearing, and Toyoda made a public apology. ####  ##### Toyota maintained all along that its electronic throttle control system was not at fault, and reiterated that on Wednesday. It has blamed ill-fitting floor mats and sticky gas pedals for the problem. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A study by U.S. safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NASA found no link between the reports of unintended acceleration and Toyota's electronic throttle control system. ####  ##### The settlement, which must be approved by a California federal judge, includes direct payments to customers as well as the installation of a brake override system in more than 2.7 million vehicles, according to the settlement agreement filed in court. ####  ##### The terms include a $250 million fund for former Toyota owners who sold vehicles at reduced prices and a separate $250 million fund for owners not eligible for the brake override system. ####  ##### Attorneys for the plaintiffs are slated to receive up to $200 million in fees and $27 million in costs, according to court documents. ####  ##### Richard Cupp, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said the settlement was large for the automotive sector but was dwarfed by other litigation involving economic loss claims. State cases against the tobacco industry, for instance, amounted to more than $200 billion. ####  ##### ""That could mean that lawsuits like these could become increasingly common, even where there is not provable physical injury on large scale,"" Mr. Cupp said. ####  ##### The case is In re: Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 10-ml-02151. #### "
"Eli Lilly to pay $29M to settle SEC bribery case","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co. agreed on Thursday to pay $29 million to settle civil charges that its subsidiaries made improper payments to foreign government officials to win business in Russia, Brazil, China and Poland. ####  ##### Lilly's settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission represents part of a broader bribery crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry by U.S. criminal and civil authorities as they continue to probe corruption. ####  ##### The settlement stems from an investigation by the SEC of Lilly's activities from 1994 to 2009, Lilly said, adding the company was first notified of the probe in 2003. ####  ##### In this case, the SEC alleged that a Russian unit of Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly used ""marketing agreements"" to funnel millions of dollars to government officials through offshore companies. ####  ##### Eli Lilly, whose products include schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa and the depression drug Cymbalta, agreed to the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying the charges. ####  ##### The SEC said that when Eli Lilly became aware of possible violations of the law that bans bribing government officials it did not intervene on the use of the marketing agreements for more than five years. Moreover, the SEC said the company's units in Brazil, China and Poland made improper payments to government officials or third-party firms associated with government officials. ####  ##### ""Eli Lilly and its subsidiaries possessed a 'check the box' mentality when it came to third-party due diligence,"" said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, head of the SEC enforcement unit that specializes in bribery cases. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""Companies can't simply rely on paper-thin assurances by employees, distributors, or customers. They need to look at the surrounding circumstances of any payment to adequately assess whether it could wind up in a government official's pocket."" ####  ##### Eli Lilly in a statement said that in addition to paying $29.4 million, it agreed to have an independent compliance consultant conduct a 60-day review of its internal controls and FCPA compliance. ####  ##### ""Lilly requires our employees to act with integrity with all external parties and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,"" said Anne Nobles, Lilly's chief ethics and compliance officer. ####  ##### Nobles said Lilly had cooperated with the U.S. investigators and strengthened its internal controls, including significant investment in a global anti-corruption program. ####  ##### Under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is illegal for U.S. companies and foreign firms with listed U.S. stock to bribe government officials. ####  ##### In February, a review by Reuters showed that eight of the world's top 10 drug makers, including Eli Lilly, had all warned investors they could face liabilities related to corruption charges in overseas markets. ####  ##### Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay $60 million this year to settle FCPA charges and Johnson & Johnson reached a $70 million settlement last year. ####  ##### Pfizer is on track to record $10 billion in sales from emerging markets this year, while J&J said Brazil, Russia, India and China accounted for just under 10 percent of the $65 billion in sales it reported last year. ####  ##### Some experts say the kinds of fines paid for FCPA infractions may not be a great deterrent to big companies, which are relying increasingly on sales in emerging markets. ####  ##### The law firm Shearman & Sterling, which puts out a semi-annual report tracking FCPA enforcement, found that penalties across all industries have averaged less than $20 million. #### "

"Marine reinsurance rates rise amid generally stable market: Willis Re","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, Willis Group"," ##### Although rates for property reinsurance remained generally stable at the Jan. 1 renewal, rates for marine business rose sharply, according to a study by Willis Re, the reinsurance arm of London-based brokerage Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. ####  ##### According to the study, released Monday, U.S. rates for property catastrophe business were flat or down by 5%, on average, on loss-free accounts. Accounts that suffered losses in 2012 saw rate increases of up to 10%, according to the report. ####  ##### A number of large accounts that suffered losses from Superstorm Sandy do not renew until later in the year, the report noted. ####  ##### For international property catastrophe business, rates were flat or down by as much as 5%, on average, the report said. ####  ##### “In the absence of Superstorm Sandy, reinsurers would have found it difficult to resist buyer pressure for further concessions,” said Peter Hearn, chairman of Willis Re, and John Cavanagh, CEO of Willis Re, in the report. “As such, Sandy's impact has helped to stabilize market pricing on an overall basis, and reinsurers have largely delivered to their clients in terms of capacity and continuity,” they said. ####  ##### Marine reinsurance buyers are seeing rate increases of 15% and higher even on loss-free offshore energy excess-of-loss contracts after a “difficult year” for the marine market, which suffered losses from Superstorm Sandy, the loss of the cruise ship Costa Concordia in January 2012 and a deterioration in losses stemming from the October 2011 M.V. Rena oil spill off the coast of New Zealand, among other things, according to the report. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Many marine insurance buyers have increased their retentions to help offset the impact of rate increases, the report noted. ####  ##### Renewals for marine business were very late, partly because of uncertainty over Superstorm Sandy losses, according to the report. ####  ##### Rates for marine insurance buyers that are members of Protection and Indemnity Clubs are likely to see rate increases of a minimum of 10% when that business renews on Feb. 20, with the reinsurance program purchased by the International Group of P&I Clubs subject to a rate hike of more than 40%, according to the report. ####  ##### The report is available here. #### "

"U.S. government warns on Java as security concerns escalate","Risk Management","Tech Insights"," ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security urged computer users to disable Oracle Corp.'s Java software, amplifying security experts' prior warnings to the hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses that use it to surf the Web. ####  ##### Hackers have figured out a way to exploit Java to install malicious software enabling them to commit crimes ranging from identity theft to making an infected computer part of an ad-hoc network of computers that can be used to attack websites. ####  ##### ""We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,"" the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team said in a posting on its website late on Thursday. ####  ##### ""This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered,"" the agency said. ""To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, disable Java in Web browsers."" ####  ##### Java is a computer language that enables programmers to write software utilizing just one set of code that will run on virtually any type of computer, including ones that use Microsoft Corp.'s Windows, Apple Inc.'s OS X and Linux, an operating system widely employed by corporations. ####  ##### Computer users access Java programs through modules, or plug-ins, that run Java software on top of browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. ####  ##### The U.S. government's warning on Java came after security experts earlier on Thursday warned of the newly discovered flaw. ####  ##### It is relatively rare for government agencies to advise computer users to completely disable software due to a security bug, particularly in the case of widely used programs such as Java. They typically recommend taking steps to mitigate the risk of attack while manufacturers prepare an update, or hold off on publicizing the problem until an update is prepared. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In September, the German government advised the public to temporarily stop using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to give it time to patch a security vulnerability that opened it to attacks. ####  ##### The Department of Homeland Security said that attackers could trick targets into visiting malicious websites that would infect their PCs with software capable of exploiting the bug in Java. ####  ##### It said that an attacker could also infect a legitimate website by uploading malicious software that would infect machines of computer users who trust that site because they have previously visited it without experiencing any problems. ####  ##### They said developers of several popular tools known as exploit kits, which criminal hackers use to attack PCs, have added software that allows hackers to exploit the newly discovered bug in Java to attack computers. ####  ##### Security experts have been scrutinizing the safety of Java since a similar security scare in August, which prompted some of them to advise using the software only on an as-needed basis. ####  ##### At the time they advised businesses to only allow their workers to use Java browser plug-ins when prompted for permission by trusted programs such as GoToMeeting, a Web-based collaboration tool from Citrix Systems Inc. ####  ##### Adam Gowdiak, a researcher with Polish security firm Security Explorations, subsequently said that he had found other security bugs in Java that continued to make computers vulnerable to attack. ####  ##### Java suffered another setback in October when Apple began removing old versions of the software from Internet browsers of Mac computers when its customers installed new versions of its OS X operating system. Apple did not provide a reason for the change and both companies declined comment at the time. #### "
"Burger King franchisee Carrols settles EEOC harassment suit for $2.5M ","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Carrols Corp., the world's largest Burger King Corp. franchisee, has agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit first brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1998. ####  ##### The president of the Syracuse, N.Y.-based company, which operates more than 572 Burger King restaurants, said in a statement that it only agreed to the settlement because it was less costly than continuing to pursue litigation. ####  ##### The EEOC on Tuesday said the lawsuit had alleged discrimination against 89 female employees at Burger King locations throughout the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast. The agency said the alleged harassment — which ranged from obscene comments, jokes and propositions to unwanted touching, exposure of genitalia, strip searches, stalking and rape — was perpetrated by managers in most cases. ####  ##### The EEOC said the company retaliated against some of the women by cutting their hours, manufacturing discipline against them and firing them, while it forced more women to quit because the harassment made their working conditions intolerable. ####  ##### To settle the litigation, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Syracuse, Carrols will pay $2.5 million in compensatory damages and lost wages to the 89 women and implement measures that include increasing employees' awareness of Carrols' anti-harassment policies, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “As this case demonstrates, the EEOC will persist in enforcing the legal prohibitions against harassment until the matter is resolved,” EEOC general counsel P. David Lopez said in a statement. “Although employers may have adequate anti-harassment policies on paper, they are of little value when employers fail to take positive steps to prevent or remedy harassment. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Employers must make sure employees know about the policies and then they must respond effectively when complaints are brought forward,” Mr. Lopez said. ####  ##### Carrols said in a statement that the EEOC had unsuccessfully sought to establish a class action based on a claim of “pattern or practice” across its restaurants in 13 states, and that court rulings left “only a relative handful of claims to be resolved and a vindication of Carrols' longstanding written policies and procedures.” ####  ##### “We unequivocally do not tolerate sexual harassment in our workplace and have resolved this litigation without any admission of wrongdoing after many years of intensive, costly and frustrating litigation with the EEOC,” Daniel T. Accordino, CEO of Carrols Restaurant Group Inc., a unit of Carrols Corp., said in the statement, ####  ##### “At Carrols, we take sexual harassment very seriously and have long had comprehensive procedures and processes in place to encourage our employees to report violations to our policies and to do so without fear of retaliation. We also have a long history of thoroughly investigating employee complaints and terminating employees who have harassed others.” ####  ##### Mr. Accordino added, “We agreed to this negotiated settlement at this stage of the litigation simply because the settlement payment we've agreed to make is far less than the cost and expense we would incur to continue to litigate each of the remaining individual claims to conclusion given the age of the claims and because hundreds of potential witnesses were now, after 14 years, in scattered locations across the country, ill or deceased. ####  ##### “Our agreement with the EEOC to continue, and in limited circumstances, enhance our best practices on harassment prevention and training confirms our commitment to providing a workplace with equal opportunity and free from sexual harassment.” #### "

"Still no timetable for returning Boeing 787 to flight","Risk Management","European Union, Risk Management, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Middle East/Africa, Switzerland, India"," ##### (Reuters) — Japanese regulators have joined their U.S. counterparts in all but ruling out overcharged batteries as the cause of recent fires on the Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner, which has been grounded for a week with no end in sight. ####  ##### Solving the battery issue has become the primary focus of the investigation, though the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday there are still no firm answers as to the cause and no clear timetable yet for returning the plane to flight. ####  ##### Meanwhile, as deliveries of the cutting-edge passenger jet back up, a key Chinese customer lamented the delays and said its growth plans were being hampered by its inability to get the planes on time. ####  ##### Regulators grounded the Dreamliner on Jan. 16 after a series of safety incidents, including battery fires on planes in the United States and Japan. The Japanese incident forced a plane to make an emergency landing. ####  ##### Last weekend the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said the fire on a Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. 787 in Boston was not due to excess voltage, and on Wednesday, Japanese officials all but ruled it out for the incident on an All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. plane there. ####  ##### ""On the surface, it appears there was no overcharging,"" said Norihiro Goto, chairman of the Japan Transport Safety Board, at a media briefing. ####  ##### ""The fact that such electrical system-related incidents would occur consecutively, purely from my perspective, could not have been expected. We are finding it difficult trying to figure out what kind of investigative stance we should take."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The investigation has also renewed scrutiny on the FAA's 2007 decision to let Boeing use a highly flammable battery technology on the 787. A U.S. Senate committee will hold a hearing in coming weeks to examine aviation safety oversight and the FAA's decision, a congressional aide said on Tuesday. ####  ##### While the NTSB and JTSB hunt for a solution to the battery question, there is also an open issue around fuel leaks on the Dreamliner. In early December, U.S. officials warned of a manufacturing fault with fuel lines, and this month a JAL plane in Boston leaked before takeoff. ####  ##### Industrial manufacturer Eaton Corp. said Wednesday it was cooperating with investigators looking at the fuel leaks. ####  ##### ""Without speaking about either the incident or investigation, I can tell you that we do supply pumps and valves to the program,"" a spokeswoman said. ####  ##### The 787 program was already years behind schedule before last week's grounding, which means Boeing cannot deliver newly manufactured planes to customers. Boeing's chief 787 engineer, Mike Sinnett, told an aviation conference in Dublin he could not say when that would change. ####  ##### ""I can't really say anything about the timeframe of the investigation. The NTSB is really the only authorized authority in the U.S. to talk about this investigation and they made some recent statements, but I can't speculate on timeframe,"" Mr. Sinnett said Wednesday in recorded remarks supplied to Reuters. ####  ##### U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the country's top transportation official, said Wednesday the goal was to return the 787 to service as soon as possible but that the government would not rush the plane back either. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""We are working diligently with Boeing to figure out the problem and find a solution. Our goal is to get this done as quickly as possible, but we must be confident that the problems are solved before we can move forward,"" Mr. LaHood told the Aero Club of Washington, an aviation advocacy group. ####  ##### FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, appearing at the same event, said the review was looking at the 787's certification, manufacturing and assembly processes, and that he could not speculate on an end date. ####  ##### For at least one Chinese customer, the uncertainty about the Dreamliner's production and delivery schedule has meant delays in launching new routes. ####  ##### ""Frankly, it's a little disappointing the aircraft has been delayed so many times,"" said Chen Feng, chairman of Hainan Airlines Co. Ltd. parent HNA Group, in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We still think it's a good aircraft, but this has had some effect on our planning."" ####  ##### Hainan has 10 of the planes on order. ####  ##### The grounding of the Dreamliner, an advanced carbon-composite plane with a list price of $207 million, has already forced Japan's ANA to cancel 151 domestic and 26 international flights scheduled for Jan. 23-28, affecting more than 21,000 passengers, the airline said on Monday. ####  ##### ANA, which flies the most Dreamliners of any airline, is due to announce further flight cancellation plans on Thursday. ####  ##### Boeing has already delivered 50 of the 787s to date. Around half of those have been in operation in Japan, but airlines in India, South America, Poland, Qatar and Ethiopia, as well as United Airlines in the United States, are also flying the plane. ####  ##### Boeing's main competitor, EADS, said on Wednesday it did not expect the problems with the 787 to affect the certification of its own rival plane, the Airbus A350. ####  ##### ""We will do what is needed to avoid the same problems,"" EADS strategy chief Marwan Lahoud told France's Radio Classic. ####  ##### Airbus has said it hopes to achieve the maiden flight of the carbon-composite A350 by the middle of this year. #### "
"Family of former Chargers star Junior Seau sues NFL over suicide","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — The family of former San Diego Chargers star Junior Seau, who killed himself last year, sued the National Football League on Wednesday, claiming that his suicide resulted from brain disease caused by repeated hits to the head during his football career. ####  ##### The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court by Mr. Seau's children and ex-wife, as well as the trustee of his estate, also claims that the NFL concealed the risks of brain damage in the sport, court documents showed. ####  ##### ""We know this lawsuit will not bring back Junior,"" the Seau family said in a written statement. ""But it will send a message that the NFL needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations."" ####  ##### An NFL spokesman, Greg Aiello, told Reuters the league's attorneys would review the lawsuit and respond to the claims appropriately through the court. ####  ##### Mr. Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Chargers and two other teams, died in May 2012 after shooting himself in the chest at his beachfront house in his hometown of Oceanside, Calif. ####  ##### A study by a team of independent researchers released this month found that Mr. Seau, 43, suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE — the same debilitating brain disease diagnosed in at least two other former NFL players who committed suicide. ####  ##### The NFL previously has said the result of the examination of Mr. Seau's brain underscored ""the recognized need for additional research to accelerate a fuller understanding of CTE."" NFL clubs have already committed a $30 million research grant to the National Institutes of Health. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Increased awareness and knowledge about brain injuries have unsettled the National Football League, a $9 billion a year industry. The league has attempted to institute rule changes protecting player safety while still preserving the spectacle that fans enjoy, which is partly based on the speed and power of the athletes colliding with one another. ####  ##### Several thousand former NFL players have sued the NFL in federal court in Philadelphia, accusing the league of fraudulently concealing from players the risk of brain injury in playing professional football. ####  ##### Just weeks before Mr. Seau shot himself, former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling committed suicide, and family members described a long descent into dementia after his retirement from the NFL. An autopsy revealed indications of CTE. ####  ##### In February 2011, four-time Pro Bowl safety Dave Duerson, who played most of his career with the Chicago Bears, shot himself in the chest. In a suicide note, he donated his brain for study, and it was found to exhibit signs of CTE. ####  ##### CTE, once known as boxer's dementia, is caused by repeated impacts to the brain, and has been found in athletes who suffered head injuries as well as members of the armed forces with concussive injuries from blast waves. ####  ##### Because the mild and moderate brain injuries do not show up on CT scans or other imaging, the condition can be definitively diagnosed only through an autopsy. #### "

"Dreamliner probe widens after excess battery voltage ruled out","Risk Management","Asia-Pacific & Australasia"," ##### (Reuters) — U.S. safety investigators on Sunday ruled out excess voltage as the cause of a battery fire this month on a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner jet operated by Japan Airlines Co. and said they were expanding the probe to look at the battery's charger and the jet's auxiliary power unit. ####  ##### Last week, governments across the world grounded the Dreamliner while Boeing halted deliveries after a problem with a lithium-ion battery on a second 787 plane, flown by All Nippon Airways Co., forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing in western Japan. ####  ##### A growing number of investigators and Boeing executives are working around the clock to determine what caused the two incidents, which the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says released flammable chemicals and could have sparked a fire in the plane's electrical compartment. ####  ##### There are still no clear answers about the root cause of the battery failures, but the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board's statement eliminated one possible answer that had been raised by Japanese investigators. ####  ##### It also underscored the complexity of investigating a battery system that includes manufacturers across the world, and may point to a design problem with the battery that could take longer to fix than swapping out a faulty batch of batteries. ####  ##### ""Examination of the flight recorder data from the JAL B-787 airplane indicates that the APU (auxiliary power unit) battery did not exceed its designed voltage of 32 volts,"" the NTSB said in a statement issued early Sunday. ####  ##### On Friday, a Japanese safety official had told reporters that excessive electricity may have overheated the battery in the ANA-owned Dreamliner that was forced to make the emergency landing at Japan's Takamatsu airport last week. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""The NTSB wanted to set the record straight,"" said one source familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. ####  ##### U.S. investigators already have examined the lithium-ion battery that powered the APU, where the battery fire started in the JAL plane, as well as several other components removed from the airplane, including wire bundles and battery management circuit boards, the NTSB statement said. ####  ##### On Tuesday, investigators will convene in Tucson, Ariz., to test and examine the charger for the battery, and to download nonvolatile memory from the APU controller, with similar tests planned at the Phoenix facility where the APUs are built. Other components have been sent for download or examination to Boeing's Seattle facility and manufacturer facilities in Japan. ####  ##### Securaplane Technologies Inc., a unit of Britain's Meggitt P.L.C. that makes the charger, said it will fully support the U.S. investigation. ####  ##### Officials with United Technologies Corp., which builds the plane's auxiliary power unit and is the main supplier of electrical systems on the 787, said they would also cooperate with the investigation. ####  ##### The NTSB's decision to travel to Securaplane's facility sparked fresh questions about the safety of the lithium-ion batteries that remain at the heart of the investigation. ####  ##### While the 787 is the most aggressive user of lithium-ion battery technology in commercial aviation, the industry at large is testing it, and the FAA has approved its use in several different planes, each governed by ""special conditions."" ####  ##### ""Lithium-ion batteries are significantly more susceptible to internal failures that can result in self-sustaining increases in temperature and pressure,"" the FAA said in 2006, when it allowed Airbus to use lithium batteries for the emerging lighting system on its A380. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Securaplane, which first began working on the charger in 2004, suffered millions of dollars of damages in November 2006 after a lithium-ion battery used in testing exploded and sparked a fire that burned an administrative building to the ground. ####  ##### Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said an investigation into the 2006 fire was later determined to have been caused by an improper test setup, not the battery design. He declined comment on the current 787 investigations. ####  ##### After the fire, a former Securaplane employee named Michael Leon sued the company, alleging that he was fired for raising security concerns about the charger and discrepancies between their assembly documents and the finished chargers. ####  ##### Mr. Leon's suit was later dismissed. ####  ##### The FAA on Sunday said it had investigated Mr. Leon's safety complaints in 2008 and 2009 but concluded his allegations focused on prototypes that were not ultimately used in the new lightweight airliner. ####  ##### FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the reviews also found that Securaplane's production of a particular printed circuit board complied with FAA requirements. ####  ##### Japan's GS Yuasa Corp. makes lithium-ion batteries for the Dreamliner, while France's Thales produces the control systems for the battery. Thales has declined comment. ####  ##### In its statement, the NTSB said French authorities were also participating in the investigation. No comment was immediately available from the French safety agency. ####  ##### The Japan Transport Safety Board said it was aware of the NTSB report and would consider the U.S. statement in its probe. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The NTSB said the Japanese agency was participating in its investigation of the Boston incident, while NTSB officials were helping the agency with its investigation of the emergency landing in Japan. Both investigations were ongoing. ####  ##### ""There's nothing more I can add at this point, as we still haven't started our investigation into the battery here,"" JTSB inspector Hideyo Kosugi told Reuters. ""The NTSB's investigation started earlier. We still haven't taken X-rays or CT-scans of the battery."" ####  ##### Mr. Kosugi said both the battery and the surrounding systems were being stored in Tokyo's Haneda Airport until authorities decided where to conduct the Japanese investigation. ####  ##### Boeing said on Friday it would continue building the carbon-composite 787, but it put deliveries on hold until the FAA approves and implements a plan to ensure the safety of potentially flammable lithium-ion batteries. ####  ##### In Washington, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the 787, which has a list price of $207 million, would not fly until regulators were ""1,000% sure"" it was safe. ####  ##### Japan is the biggest market so far for the 787, with ANA and JAL operating 24 of the 290-seat wide-bodied planes. Boeing has orders for almost 850 of the planes, which have the most complex electrical systems of any planes on the market. ####  ##### It remains unclear if the investigations will cause other airlines — and military aircraft builder — to rethink their plans to use lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and more powerful than conventional batteries. ####  ##### Airbus plans to use similar batteries on its rival to the 787, the A350, which is due to make its maiden test flight in the middle of this year. ####  ##### European executives said last week they would study the findings of the U.S. investigation, but said their decision to move more slowly than Boeing towards electric systems, and spread the load over twice as many batteries, would reduce the risk. ####  ##### Aviation Week quoted Airbus programs chief Tom Williams as saying ""failure management"" was key and that any escaping gases from the A350 batteries would be protected by titanium as they are expelled from the aircraft. The company has not said if it would attempt to suppress a lithium fire or focus on containing a lithium blaze, as Boeing has done. ####  ##### Mr. Williams told Aviation Week that switching from lithium back to nickel cadmium would require significant engineering work with both space and weight penalties. Airbus was not immediately available to comment on the article. ####  ##### Brazilian planemaker Embraer S.A. declined comment when asked if it planned to rethink its use of lithium-ion batteries on its military transport plane and new business jets. ####  ##### The Embraer programs use a battery made in the United States, unlike the Japanese one on the 787. ####  ##### Lockheed Martin Corp., maker of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, has said it does not see a problem since the lithium-ion batteries on the military plane are made by France's Saft Groupe, not Yuasa. #### "

"BASF to pay $500,000 to settle retaliation lawsuit","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Chemical company BASF Corp. has agreed to pay $500,000 to settle an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission retaliation lawsuit in which an employee refused to sign away his right to sue for any future discrimination. ####  ##### In its lawsuit, the EEOC alleged that Cognis Corp., which has since been acquired by BASF, required Steven Whitlow, a long-term employee at its Kankakee, Ill., facility, to sign a “last-chance agreement” as a condition of continued employment. The agreement prohibited him from filing discrimination charges with the EEOC even for events that had not yet occurred. ####  ##### Cognis fired him when he informed the company he did not want to be bound by the agreement out of concern about how it would affect his civil rights, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The lawsuit, which accused the company of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, also accused Cognis of retaliation against five additional employees by forcing them to make a similarly illegal choice. These employees chose to sign the last-chance agreement rather than be terminated. By settling the lawsuit, BASF has opted not to continue defending those allegations, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### U.S. District Court Judge Michael P. McCuskey in an Urbana, Ill., hearing last May ruled that the company unlawfully retaliated against Mr. Whitlow. ####  ##### Judge McCuskey entered a consent decree resolving the lawsuit on Jan. 25, and the EEOC announced the settlement last week. In addition to providing monetary relief to the workers, the decree requires BASF to report all employee Title VII retaliation complaints to the EEOC for the next two years. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Cognis presented the victims in this case with a terrible, illegal choice: lose your job or lose your civil rights,” EEOC Chicago District Director John Rowe said in a statement. “Under the law, no worker has to make that kind of choice. Employers would be better served by working to ensure that their employees are free from discrimination, rather than threatening their workers with termination in an effort to make sure that employees don't complain."" ####  ##### In a statement, BASF said it is “satisfied to have reached a settlement with the EEOC and six other individuals participating in this lawsuit regarding events that occurred at the Kankakee site before BASF acquired it from Cognis Corp. ####  ##### “The settlement allows BASF to move forward without having to incur the time and expense of having to further litigate this matter. BASF is deeply committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and takes its responsibilities for compliance with all federal, state and local laws seriously.” ####  ##### Florham, N.J.-based BASF, a North American affiliate of Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF S.E.A., acquired Cognis in August 2010. #### "
"Appeals court upholds $415k verdict against Auto Zone in EEOC lawsuit","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, Employment Practices, Workers Comp Coverage, Disability"," ##### A federal appeals court has upheld a $415,000 verdict against auto parts retailer AutoZone Inc. in a disability discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ####  ##### The case considered in Friday's ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. AutoZone Inc. has a long and complex history. According to the ruling, John Shepherd began working for Memphis, Tenn.-based AutoZone in 1998, but had suffered a chronic back injury while working for a different employer. Mr. Shepherd claimed that despite repeated requests for accommodation, his supervisors insisted he mop AutoZone's floors, which caused flare-ups of his injury. ####  ##### After he sought to return to work following one such injury flare-up in January 2004, AutoZone would not allow him to return and kept him on involuntary medical leave until February 2005, when it terminated his employment. The EEOC filed suit on Mr. Shepherd's behalf in 2007, charging the firm with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to accommodate his disability, and with retaliation when it refused to allow him to return to work and later terminated him. ####  ##### Court actions ####  ##### A magistrate judge granted summary judgment to AutoZone on the accommodation claim, but allowed the involuntary leave and termination claims to go to trial. A jury ruled in AutoZone's favor on those claims. The EEOC appealed the magistrate's grant of summary judgment on the accommodation claim, but not the jury's verdict. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On appeal, in 2010 the 7th Circuit reversed the magistrate judge's grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. After a second trial, a jury awarded Mr. Shepherd $115,000 in back pay, $100,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages. The magistrate judge remitted the punitive damages to $200,000 to bring the compensatory and punitive damages within the ADA's $300,000 statutory cap. He also issued an injunction on AutoZone's antidiscrimination practices. ####  ##### AutoZone appealed the ruling. The appellate court affirmed the judge's monetary award. On compensatory damages, for instance, the unanimous three-judge panel said the judge “accurately observed that the compensatory damages in this case are approximately the same value as the compensatory damages awarded in comparable cases. … In fact, Shepherd's case is more extreme than some of these cases because Shepherd experienced near-daily pain that left him incapable of performing common activities, such as putting on his clothes and taking a shower.” ####  ##### The appellate court agreed to remand for further proceedings a provision in the injunction against AutoZone, stating it should be adjusted to reflect a time limit. #### "
"Security experts say zombie TV warning exposes flaws","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — The zombie attack alert issued on a handful of U.S. TV stations this week is more serious than a mischievous hacker prank say cyber experts, who warn the incident exposes lax security practices in a critical public safety system. ####  ##### While broadcasters said poor password security paved the way for the bogus warning, security experts said the equipment used by the Emergency Alert System remained vulnerable when stations allow it be accessed via the public Internet. ####  ##### The fear is that hackers could prevent the government from sending out public warnings during an emergency or attackers could conduct a more damaging hoax than a warning of a zombie apocalypse. ####  ##### ""It isn't what they said. It is the fact that they got into the system. They could have caused some real damage,"" said Karole White, president of the Michigan Association of Broadcasters. ####  ##### Following the attacks on Monday, broadcasters were ordered to change the passwords for the EAS equipment. ####  ##### The Federal Communications Commission would not comment on the attacks, but in an urgent advisory sent to television stations on Tuesday said: ""All EAS participants are required to take immediate action."" ####  ##### It instructed them to change passwords on equipment from all manufacturers used to deliver emergency broadcasts. The FCC instructed them to ensure gear was properly secured behind firewalls and to inspect systems to ensure that hackers had not queued ""unauthorized alerts"" for future transmission. ####  ##### The attacks come after warnings by government officials and outside security experts that the United States is at risk of a cyber attack that could cause major physical damage or even cost lives. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### President Barack Obama told Congress on Tuesday that some hackers were looking for ways to attack the U.S. power grid, banks and air traffic control systems. ####  ##### Ms. White and her counterpart in Montana, Greg MacDonald, said they believed the hackers were able to get in because TV stations had not changed the default passwords they used when the equipment was first shipped from the manufacturer. ####  ##### But Mike Davis, a hardware security expert with a firm known as IOActive Labs, said hackers could still get past new passwords to remotely access the systems. ####  ##### Mr. Davis said he had submitted a report to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or US-CERT, about a month ago that detailed the security flaws. ####  ##### ""Changing passwords is insufficient to prevent unauthorized remote login. There are still multiple undisclosed authentication bypasses,"" he told Reuters via email. ""I would recommend disconnecting them from the network until a fix is available."" ####  ##### Mr. Davis said he was able to use Google Inc.'s search engine to identify some 30 systems that he believed were vulnerable to attack as of Wednesday morning. ####  ##### Privately held Monroe Electronics, whose equipment was compromised in Monday's attacks, said it was still evaluating the risks. ####  ##### ""The situation appears to just be the password stuff, but we are looking at anything else and everything that might come into play,"" Vice President Bill Robertson told Reuters. ####  ##### A spokesman for US-CERT said he could not immediately comment on the matter. ####  ##### The zombie hackers targeted two stations in Michigan, and several in California, Montana and New Mexico, Ms. White said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A male voice addressed viewers in a video posted on the Internet of the bogus warning broadcast from KRTV, a CBS affiliate based in Great Falls, Mont.: ""Civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from the grave and attacking the living."" ####  ##### The voice warned not ""to approach or apprehend these bodies as they are extremely dangerous."" ####  ##### Stuart McClure, chief executive of cyber security firm Cylance Inc., said he had investigated cases in which hackers accessed EAS systems via a different method: breaking into hidden accounts built into the systems by manufacturers so that service technicians can easily access them for repairs. ####  ##### ""You cannot give a separate pass code to everybody. Nobody is going to remember it. You have to share the secret,"" said Mr. McClure, who previously ran a unit at Intel Corp.'s McAfee security division that investigated cyber attacks. ####  ##### Electronics industry experts said that it is tough for some broadcasters to follow all security guidelines because staff at small stations lack the expertise to do so. ####  ##### The equipment that was compromised obtains emergency broadcasts by frequently using the Internet to make outward calls to trusted government servers. When it finds an alert on one of those servers, it broadcasts it on that station. ####  ##### Monroe Electronics said its gear is designed to let stations make outgoing queries, but still keep outsiders from getting in. ####  ##### It recommends against unsecured access to the Internet. ""It's the wild, wild West,"" said Mr. Robertson. ####  ##### He said the equipment sometimes gets exposed to the open Internet because it is not properly configured or because engineers want remote access when they are on call. ####  ##### Mr. Robertson said the company was working to beef up security on the equipment and might update its software to compel customers to change default passwords. ####  ##### Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dan Watson said that the zombie breach did not have any impact on the government's ability to activate the Emergency Alert System. #### "

"Police officer whistle-blower's wrongful termination case can proceed","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A police officer, who was fired after complaining to the FBI about being forced to release a politically connected driver he had arrested, can pursue his wrongful termination claim, an appeals court ruled. ####  ##### According to last week's ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in David Kristofek v. Village of Orland Hills and Thomas Scully, in November 2010, Mr. Kristofek, a part-time officer for the Illinois village's police department, arrested a driver who was the son of a former mayor of a nearby town for having a suspended registration and no proof of insurance. The department's deputy police chief ordered Mr. Kristofek to release the driver without charging him. ####  ##### Subsequently, Mr. Kristofek expressed concern to fellow officers “that he and other officers were potentially involved with political corruption and that they may have committed a crime,” according to the ruling. He also consulted with an attorney on the issue, and pursuant to the attorney's advice, went to the FBI, and was told there would be an investigation. ####  ##### In April 2011, the department's police chief, Thomas Scully, gave Mr. Kristofek the option of resigning or having his employment terminated. When Mr. Kristofek said he would not resign, Mr. Scully fired him. ####  ##### Mr. Kristofek subsequently filed suit, claiming violations of his First Amendment rights and the Illinois Whistleblower Act, among other state laws. A lower court in Chicago dismissed the case, holding that Mr. Kristofek's “sole motive in spreading the word about political corruption was to protect himself from civil and criminal liability.” ####  ##### In overruling the lower court and reinstating the case, a three-judge panel held “a public employee's speech may still be protected if the speaker's motives were mixed, and also included a desire to help the public.” ####  ##### The panel said “at no point does the complaint allege that Mr. Kristofek's' only motive was to protect himself. The mere fact that Kristofek was motivated by his self-interest does not make it implausible that he was also motivated to help the public,” said the court. ####  ##### Furthermore, said the court, “even if Kristofek was motivated exclusively by his own self-interest, his First Amendment claim would not necessarily be dismissed.” A whistle-blower's “exclusive motive may be a desire for fame and a book deal, but it is also accurate to say that the main objective of his speech, given its content, context, and the manner it which it is delivered — is to reform the system,” the appellate court ruled in remanding the case. #### "
"FAA approves Boeing 787 certification plan","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday approved Boeing Co.'s plan to certify a redesigned battery system on the 787 Dreamliner and will permit two aircraft limited flights to test it. ####  ##### The FAA's move puts Boeing one step closer to returning the troubled 787 to the air after the plane was grounded in mid-January by transport authorities worldwide following two incidents involving burning batteries. ####  ##### ""We won't allow the plane to return to service unless we're satisfied that the new design ensures the safety of the aircraft and its passengers,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. ####  ##### Boeing's new battery — which it presented to the FAA in late February — is designed to minimize the chances of a short circuit, insulates the cells within the battery better and adds a new containment and venting system to prevent damage even if the battery catches fire. ####  ##### The FAA said the new design must pass a series of tests before it is approved and that the agency will be ""closely involved"" in the certification process. ####  ##### ""Today's approval from the FAA is a critical and welcome milestone toward getting the fleet flying again and continuing to deliver on the promise of the 787,"" Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said in a statement. ####  ##### Regulators grounded the 50 Dreamliners in use by airlines on Jan. 16 after lithium-ion batteries burned aboard two planes, banning airlines from flying the 787 and stopping Boeing from delivering them. Although its factories continue to make the 787, Boeing is losing an estimated $50 million a week while the planes are grounded. #### "
"Toys R Us charged with discriminating against deaf job applicant","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Toys R Us Inc. faces an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit charging the retailer with violating federal law when it allegedly refused to provide an interpreter for a deaf job applicant and then failed to hire her. ####  ##### The EEOC said Tuesday that Shakirra Thomas applied for a team member position at the Wayne, N.J.-based retailer's Columbia, Md., store in October, 2011. ####  ##### According to the EEOC, when Toys R Us contacted Ms. Thomas to invite her to a group interview, her mother advised the company that Ms. Thomas was deaf and requested an interpreter for the interview. The company refused and said Ms. Thomas would have to provide her own interpreter. ####  ##### After Ms. Thomas' mother interpreted for her during the group interview, the company refused to hire Ms. Thomas despite her qualifications and ability to perform the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, the EEOC said. The agency is charging the company with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### “Federal law requires employers to provide a reasonable accommodation during the interview process, including providing an American Sign Language interpreter, unless the employer can show it would be a significant difficulty or expense to do so,” said EEOC district director Spencer H. Lewis Jr., of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office, in a statement. ####  ##### “It is difficult to understand how it would have been an undue hardship for such a large retailer to provide an interpreter when asked to so,” he said. ####  ##### The company said in a statement, “As this is a matter of pending litigation, we cannot comment at this time.” ####  ##### In September 2012, Oshkosh, Wis.-based catalog retailer Miles Kimball Co. reached a $95,000 settlement with the EEOC in a case in which a deaf worker was allegedly fired after the company denied her request for a sign language interpreter to help train her on a new software program for the company's computer system. #### "
"Transocean should have done more before 2010 Gulf spill: CEO","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Catastrophes, Energy"," ##### (Reuters) — The chief executive of Transocean Ltd., owner of the rig destroyed after BP P.L.C.'s Macondo well blew out in 2010, testified on Tuesday that his workers made mistakes that day, but were not responsible for overall safety at the site. ####  ##### Steven Newman, who had been CEO for less than two months when the blowout occurred, was emotional at times as he spoke of the company's responsibilities prior to the accident that killed 11 people and caused the worst U.S. offshore oil spill. ####  ##### ""We acknowledge that we should have done more,"" he said under questioning by a lawyer for Transocean, in the fourth week of a civil trial to determine blame for the spill. ####  ##### Mr. Newman's voice shook as he spoke of the April 20, 2010, disaster on the Deepwater Horizon rig, but he denied that Transocean cut corners when it came to safety procedures. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Gulf states affected and other plaintiffs are suing BP, Transocean and other companies for economic and environmental damages related to the spill. BP accepts its role in the accident, but believes Transocean and well-cementing provider Halliburton Co. share the blame. ####  ##### Mr. Newman said Transocean was in charge of safely performing its own operations on the rig, but that overall responsibility for safety at the well site rested solely with BP. ####  ##### In the same New Orleans federal court two weeks ago before U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier, a Transocean worker who was on the Deepwater Horizon during the blowout acknowledged there was a misinterpretation of trouble signs beforehand. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Newman discussed how Transocean responds to potentially dangerous situations such as a ""kick,"" which results when unexpected pressure forces fluids upward through the well. Company policy states a well should be shut in if a kick pushes as much as 20 barrels of hydrocarbons through the drill hole. ####  ##### The kick size may be a key point in finger-pointing between Transocean and BP. In testimony on Monday, well control expert Calvin Barnwell, who reviewed the incident for Transocean, said about 39 barrels of fluid pushed up through the Macondo well in the early afternoon on the day of the explosion. ####  ##### Asked by a BP lawyer if he agreed BP was ""entitled to rely on Transocean"" to shut in the well after the 39-barrel kick, Mr. Barnwell answered yes. ####  ##### Transocean has pleaded guilty to federal charges connected with Clean Water Act violations and agreed to pay $1.4 billion in criminal and civil fines and penalties. ####  ##### As for the civil case before Judge Barbier, the companies must show any mistakes do not meet the legal definition of gross negligence required for the highest amount of damages. BP has already spent or committed $37 billion on cleanup, restoration, payouts, settlements and fines. ####  ##### Judge Barbier scheduled a hearing for April 5 to consider BP's objections to some of the ""fictitious"" and ""absurd"" oil spill compensation claims addressed through a claims facility set up last year. ####  ##### On top of that, liabilities could stretch into the tens of billions of dollars if Judge Barbier determines BP or other defendants were grossly negligent. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Establishing management responsibility could be important in proving gross negligence. Robert Cunningham, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, finished grilling of Mr. Newman by asking: ""So you have identified no management failures that caused or contributed to the blowout?"" ####  ##### ""No,"" Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Mr. Newman has been well compensated for Transocean's very public struggles over the past three years. According to a company filing on Monday, his total 2012 pay package of $14 million is more than double the level of 2010, lifted by stock and option awards and nonequity incentives. ####  ##### Transocean shares, which traded in the $80 range prior to Macondo, hit a seven-year low of $38.22 in late 2011, and have staged a relatively dramatic recovery from that trough since then. The stock closed at $52.22 on Tuesday. ####  ##### Mr. Newman was on the stand in New Orleans a day after presenting at the Howard Weil energy conference across town, where much of the talk was about the dramatic post-Macondo revival of drilling in the deepest waters of the Gulf of Mexico — described as the world's fastest-growing deepwater market. ####  ##### ""If a typical deepwater well is like going to the moon, then the Gulf of Mexico ultra-deepwater frontier is like going to Mars,"" Martin Craighead, CEO of oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc., said in a speech at the conference. ####  ##### The court case is In re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig ""Deepwater Horizon"" in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, No. 10-md-02179, in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana. #### "

"P/C insurers' enterprise risk management practices maturing: Study","Risk Management","Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Regulation, Tech Insights"," ##### A Standard & Poor’s Financial Services L.L.C. has found that enterprise risk management practices are continuing to mature at property/casualty insurers. ####  ##### The report released Thursday surveyed ERM initiatives at 146 property/casualty and life and health insurers. It assigned scores of “excellent,” “strong,” “adequate” or “weak.” ####  ##### Only three firms — Pembroke, Bermuda-based RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., New York-based The Travelers Cos. Inc. and San Antonio-based USAA Insurance Group — earned an “excellent” score. ####  ##### However, the study rated 21% of property/casualty insurers as “strong” while only 9% of life/health insurers earned that score. ####  ##### “More P&C companies (as a percentage) have scores higher than ‘adequate’ than for life and health companies,” S&P said in the report. “We believe this results primarily from the higher level of exposure life companies have to asset and market/interest-related risks and the difficulties inherent in managing those risks.” ####  ##### S&P also credited regulatory pressure for insurers attaching more rigor to their ERM efforts. ####  ##### “The approaching 2015 effective date of the National Association of Insurance Commissioner's (own risk and solvency assessment) requirements has resulted in increased momentum for improvement in insurers’ risk management processes,” the report states. ####  ##### “Companies with more robust ERM programs gauge their risk profiles better and are able to communicate them clearly to their investors and other stakeholders,” the report states. “Such companies are also able to manage their risks within their stated tolerance levels. We thus expect stronger ERM programs to result in more stable, predictable earnings, whereas companies with less robust programs likely will be more susceptible to earnings swings.” #### "
"Biotechnology firm Amgen settles kickback allegations for $24.9M","Risk Management",""," ##### Biotechnology company Amgen Inc. has agreed to pay $24.9 million to resolve charges under the False Claims Act that it was involved in a kickback scheme with long-term care pharmacy providers, the U.S. Department of Justice said. ####  ##### The settlement with Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based Amgen, announced Tuesday, settles charges it paid kickbacks to Cincinnati-based Omnicare Inc., and PharMerica Corp. and Kindred Healthcare Inc., both based in Louisville, Ky., in return for implementing “therapeutic interchange” programs designed to switch Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries from a competitor drug to its own product, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### The government charged the kickbacks took the form of “performance-based rebates” that were tied to market share or volume thresholds. The DOJ said that as part of the therapeutic interchange programs, Amgen distributed material to consulting pharmacists and nursing home staff encouraging the off-label use of Aranesp, a drug used to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure, for patients who did not have the condition. ####  ##### The DOJ said the civil settlement resolves a lawsuit filed under a whistle-blower provision of the False Claims Act that was filed in U.S. District Court in Columbia, S.C. ####  ##### The DOJ said only allegations were settled by the agreement, and that there has been no determination of liability in the case. ####  ##### “We will continue to pursue pharmaceutical companies that pay kickbacks to long-term care pharmacy providers to influence drug prescribing decisions,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, in a statement. “Patients in skilled nursing facilities deserve care that is free of improper financial influences.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “By this agreement we are making important strides in holding drug manufacturers accountable for fraudulent and abusive practices not only in South Carolina but nationwide,” said William Nettles, U.S. attorney for the District of South Carolina. ####  ##### “The conduct alleged in this case is yet another example of the pharmaceutical industry placing marketing goals over patient needs,” said Reuben A. Guttman, a Washington-based director with law firm Grant & Eisenhofer P.A., who represented whistle-blower Frank Kurnick, an Amgen employee, in the litigation, in a statement. ####  ##### “For situations like this, there has to be a pharmaceutical safety and investigation board to make an even broader report to the public so that this never happens again,” Mr. Guttman said. ####  ##### Amgen said in a statement that it has “denied all of these allegations that were resolved by the settlement.” ####  ##### It said the South Carolina settlement is the fourth of five previously disclosed whistle-blower actions filed against it “that were made known to the company in connection with discussions that resulted in an October 2011 agreement in principle to settle different allegations related to Amgen's sales and marketing practices.” ####  ##### The company said the first of these five whistle-blower suits was settled in December 2012, along with matters covered by the October 2011 agreement in principle. Amgen has been dismissed as a defendant from two of the other whistle-blower suits, according to Amgen. Information about the fifth case is under court seal, an Amgen spokeswoman said. ####  ##### In a statement issued the Dec. 12, 2012, settlement, the company said it would pay $612 million to resolve its civil liability related to certain promotional practices related to Aranesp as well as several other drugs. It said as part of the settlement agreement with the federal government, 49 states and the District of Columbia, Amgen pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor count of misbranding Aranesp “by promoting it in a way that was different from the dosages in the label.” The plea was entered in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. #### "
"Rio Tinto unit says Bingham Canyon slide worse than expected","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Catastrophes"," ##### (Reuters) — A landslide at Rio Tinto's Bingham Canyon mine in Utah extended further into the pit than predicted, and there was greater damage to equipment than previously estimated, Rio's Kennecott unit said on Friday. ####  ##### Kennecott Utah Copper, which operates the mine that is near Salt Lake City, said it had not yet determined the impact of the slide, which occurred late on Wednesday, or a time frame for resuming mining operations. ####  ##### Photos published by Salt Lake City's Deseret News show debris extending from the top of the massive pit mine to its floor, slicing through terraced roads and burying trucks. ####  ##### ""The size of the slide was significant,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""We don't have information yet regarding the magnitude or impact. We do know that the flow into the pit extended beyond the scenarios we forecasted, having a greater impact on equipment."" ####  ##### The company said on Thursday that all employees were accounted for and safe. ####  ##### In its latest statement, Kennecott said there had been some damage to equipment and to a building structure in the mine. It said experts had not been granted access to the mine. ####  ##### Landslides can seriously disrupt operations at open pit operations. Lundin Mining Corp. resumed production at its Aguablanca nickel-copper mine in Spain nearly two years after heavy rains caused a slide there. ####  ##### A note on Kennecott's website says the mine's visitor center will not reopen in 2013. ####  ##### Justin Jones, a spokesman for Kennecott, said earlier on Friday that Bingham Canyon was still producing copper from stockpiled material.

"UnitedHealth faces $524 million jury award in hepatitis case","Risk Management",""," ##### A Las Vegas jury on Tuesday awarded $524 million, including $500 million in punitive damages, against UnitedHealth Group Inc. units in connection with a hepatitis outbreak tied to a doctor who was credentialed by the insurer. ####  ##### Plaintiff attorney Robert Eglet, of law firm Eglet Wall Christiansen in Las Vegas, said between 2004 and 2008, there were 200 cases of hepatitis C tied to two endoscopy clinics run by gastroenterologist Dr. Dipak Desai, who had been credentialed by UnitedHealth. ####  ##### The jury verdicts were issued to Helen Meyer and Bonnie Brunson, who had contracted hepatitis, and Ms. Brunson's husband, Carl Brunson, who had sued for loss of consortium. Defendants in the case were UnitedHealth units Health Plan of Nevada Inc. and Sierra Health Services Inc. ####  ##### Dr. Desai was accused of using unsanitary practices in colonoscopies. Mr. Eglet said Dr. Desai had performed endoscopies that should have taken 30 minutes, in less than five. He said he represents 23 other plaintiffs in connection with the case, with the next trial scheduled for December. ####  ##### Mr. Eglet said Dr. Desai had been dropped as a preferred provider from UnitedHealth's health maintenance organization in 1992, but the HMO took him on again several years later because he performed endoscopies at a low cost. He said Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth had ignored warnings from other physicians in the community that Dr. Desai was dangerous and never informed its credentialing committee of the warnings. ####  ##### Commenting on the jury verdict, Health Plan of Nevada said in a statement: “The number announced today has no grounding whatsoever in reality — it represents fantasy damages, not punitive damages. We have a compelling case for appeal since the jurors were barred from hearing extensive evidence and testimony about how Dr. Desai's covert, criminal practices were hidden from the entire community, including Health Plan of Nevada.” ####  ##### %%break%% ####  ##### The insurer said that the jury did not hear that Dr. Desai has been criminally charged for the outbreak and that the same plaintiffs had already sued and received damages awards from a pharmaceutical company. In addition, it said that Dr. Desai was credentialed or accredited by other HMOs, hospitals and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. ####  ##### “Even more troubling, the court held that placing Dr. Desai in (HealthCare of Nevada's) network caused the plaintiffs to contract hepatitis C because: (1) plaintiffs' hepatitis C was the result of Desai's medical malpractice; and (2) a doctor's medical malpractice is always a foreseeable consequence of placing a doctor in a health plan's network. If allowed to stand, this would have a devastating impact on the availability and affordability of health insurance in Nevada,” the statement said. ####  ##### In 2010, Jerusalem-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. announced a Las Vegas jury awarded $356 million in punitive damages against its Teva Parenteral Medicines Inc. unit in connection with its propofol anesthetic, which reportedly was used in the colonoscopies. According to media reports, the company subsequently agreed to pay $250 million to settle more than 80 lawsuits over propofol sales. News reports say the issue was that Teva sold the anesthetic in oversized vials that invited reuse, which led to the hepatitis being spread. A Teva spokesman could not be reached. ####  ##### Helen Mayer as individual v. Health Plan of Nevada et al.  and Bonnie J. and Carl Brunson, individually and as husband and wife vs. Health Plan of Nevada et al. were filed in January, 2010. #### "

It also would set minimum aggregate attachment points of 120% of expected claims or $20,000, whichever is lower. ####  ##### The bill would prohibit insurers from setting attachment points that vary by individual plan participants within an insured group for claims incurred per individual. ####  ##### A previous version of the bill would have set the minimum specific attachment points at $30,000. The amended version was approved April 16 by the Colorado House Health, Insurance and Environment Committee, and on Monday passed the full Colorado House by a 45-15 vote. ####  ##### Under the plan, insurers in Colorado would be required to file annual reports with the state's insurance commissioner that detail their portfolio of stop-loss clients with 100 or fewer employees. The reports would need to include the total number of covered lives, the mean and median attachment points, and sources of prior coverage held by the stop-loss clients. ####  ##### The proposal also would give the state's insurance commissioner license to unilaterally change minimum attachment points going forward, based on medical cost inflation. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for state Rep. Elizabeth McCann, D-Denver, the bill's primary sponsor, said the bill must be introduced in the Colorado Senate prior to the legislature's May 8 recess to remain alive this session. #### "

Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said on Czech Television on Thursday that he was also preparing plans to give some affected businesses tax breaks. ####  ##### Spolana, a chemical factory in Neratovice, north of Prague, was inundated, and another chemical plant north of Prague, Lovochemie, was also affected. ####  ##### The Agrarian Chamber said that 80,000 hectares out of 4.3 million hectares of farmland — mostly grain fields but also some sugar beet and hop-growing areas — were under water. ####  ##### The country’s dominant electricity producer CEZ was forced to shut down two power plant units on Tuesday as a preventative measure, cutting off supplies to thousands of homes. ####  ##### The flooding this year was not as serious as record floods that hit Prague’s historic centre in 2002. In that year, damage around central Europe was estimated at €20 billion ($26.17 billion). The 2002 floods cost Czech insurers 35 billion crowns( $1.78 billion). #### "
"Scor buys Generali's U.S. life reinsurance business for $920 million","Risk Management","SCOR, France, Italy, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### (Reuters) — Italy's biggest insurer Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. said on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its U.S. life reinsurance business to France's Scor S.E. for total proceeds of $920 million as part of its strategy to shed non-core assets. ####  ##### The deal, under which Scor is paying €579 million ($750 million) in cash plus an additional amount for whatever the unit earns this year before the deal's expected completion in the second half, will make Scor the largest U.S. life reinsurer. ####  ##### Generali said in its statement it estimates the unit's earnings to be $30 million this year up to the time of the closing, lifting the price paid the unit to just above $780 million. ####  ##### Earlier this year Generali's new chief executive Mario Greco pledged to raise e4 billion from non-core asset sales by 2015 to shore up capital and restore value. ####  ##### Europe's third-largest insurer is also seeking to dispose of its private bank BSI but potential buyers think it is worth less that its 2.3 billion Swiss franc ($2.4 billion) book value. ####  ##### Gross proceeds from the U.S. sale, including the release of $140 million of collateral now locked in the business, are expected to total $920 million, Generali said in a statement, adding that the deal was expected to generate a capital gain of about $150 million. ####  ##### Generali, which has been undergoing a radical transformation since Mr. Greco took office just under a year ago, said the deal would lift its Solvency 1 ratio, a measure of capital strength, by 1 percentage point. ####  ##### Scor became the second-largest U.S. life reinsurer after it acquired Transamerica Re from Aegon for $912.5 million in 2011. ####  ##### Acquiring Generali USA is consistent with Scor's strategy of growing in the Americas and taking advantage of the non-cyclical nature of the life insurance market. Scor has doubled the number of its employees in the region since 2005 to support the high double-digit annual growth of the group there. ####  ##### Scor, which was bidding against Reinsurance Group of America in the last round of the auction, said it would finance the deal from its own funds and potential limited debt sale, without issuing new shares. ####  ##### Generali was advised by Citigroup and Mediobanca on the deal, while Scor was advised by BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank. #### "

"BP steps up spill payments protest with ad campaign","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental"," ##### (Reuters) — Britain's BP P.L.C. has stepped up its campaign for a revision of the way compensation for its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill is calculated by placing advertisements in leading newspapers ahead of a July 8 appeal court hearing in the United States. ####  ##### The oil major's advertisements in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post back its attempt to put a lid on payments in the billions of dollars, which the company has said could leave it ""irreparably harmed."" ####  ##### BP has no control over its payments to claimants, having agreed to a compensation formula and framework in a legal settlement covering certain personal and business liabilities. ####  ##### While the company insists that the formula is being misinterpreted, the court-appointed claims administrator disagrees and its process has been upheld by the New Orleans federal court that is dealing with a host of legal issues surrounding the 2010 disaster. ####  ##### BP hopes to have that decision overturned at its July 8 hearing in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ####  ##### ""Trial lawyers and some politicians are attempting to capitalize on this misinterpretation by encouraging the submission of thousands of claims for inflated losses, or losses that do not even exist,"" BP said in its advertisement. ####  ##### ""Whatever you think about BP, we can all agree that it's wrong for anyone to take money they don't deserve. And it's unfair to everyone in the Gulf — commercial fishermen, restaurant and hotel owners, and all the other hard-working people who've filed legitimate claims for real losses."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In a separate development last week, BP sought to use allegations against a member of claims administrator Patrick Juneau's team to back its case for a full review of the claims process. ####  ##### Mr. Juneau placed team member Lionel Sutton on administrative leave and filed a report to the U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans about allegations that Mr. Sutton had referred claimants to other lawyers in exchange for a cut of subsequent compensation. ####  ##### Mr. Juneau later issued a statement anouncing that Mr. Sutton had resigned and that the allegations would be investigated internally. ####  ##### BP described the affair as ""troubling"" and repeated its request for ""a comprehensive and public audit of the settlement program by a reputable national accounting firm."" ####  ##### Mr. Sutton did not respond to phone calls and emails requesting comment, but Associated Press last week quoted him confirming that he had been suspended. ####  ##### Much of BP's argument hinges on an interpretation of accountancy terms that the company says is too loose. One of the key triggers for a so-called business economic loss claim is the ability to show a lower revenue, higher expense, or both, during and/or after the oil spill, compared with other periods. ####  ##### Proof of a connection with the spill itself is not necessary in most cases. ####  ##### BP argues that a loose definition of what constitutes revenue and expenses produces more volatile figures and is allowing businesses to be classed as eligible claimants even though there is no real longer-term impact on profit. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The company's case against the compensation payouts was backed by a group of accountancy professors last month. ####  ##### However, BP has said that the nature of the disputed compensation payments — many small, individual payouts — means that recovering them through further litigation would be next to impossible. ####  ##### In April, BP added $500 million to its estimate of compensation payouts under the settlement based on what it knows so far. Its best guess is for a total of $8.2 billion of business economic loss and other compensation claims, with only $1.7 billion left in the $20 billion pot it set aside for paying these and other costs. ####  ##### BP has a total of $42.2 billion set aside in its accounts for cleanup costs, fines and compensation for the oil spill, which killed 11 men and devastated the Gulf of Mexico coastline. ####  ##### The extra compensation payouts BP is contesting may end up as a relatively small part of the final bill. Other developments, such as being found grossly negligent rather negligent, could increase its liability by much more. #### "

"Nuveen Investments funds sue insurance giant AIG","Risk Management","P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, AIG"," ##### A group of Nuveen Investments Inc. funds sued American International Group Inc. Tuesday, alleging that the insurance company committed a subprime mortgage market-related fraud that cost the funds billions of dollars in losses. ####  ##### The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that from March 2006 to September 2008, AIG violated securities laws and engaged in “common law fraud and unjust enrichment” with respect to issuing credit default swaps, which were designed to provide a sort of insurance on collateralized debt obligations that were backed by subprime mortgage bonds and other securities. ####  ##### In September 2008, the federal government extended what eventually became a $182 billion bailout to AIG, saving the company from collapse under the weight of its billions of dollars in losses on the swaps. The value of AIG stock and bonds plummeted with the event. The government has since sold most of the 80% AIG stake it received in the transaction. ####  ##### The Nuveen funds, which had purchased AIG stock and bonds, allege that the company and former top executives committed fraud by making false and misleading statements to investors about the losses that were bearing down on it. ####  ##### AIG and Chicago-based Nuveen declined to comment. ####  ##### Other institutional investors, including investment funds and pension funds, also have sued AIG alleging the same wrongdoing; those cases were consolidated in U.S. District Court in New York, where the plaintiffs are seeking class action status. ####  ##### “Even though AIG was aware of the downward turn of the mortgage market, it did not undertake to hedge the CDS portfolio because doing so would have undercut the profitability of the business,” the lawsuit says. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### By late 2005, AIG stopped writing swaps for CDOs, but by then AIG was already insuring about $80 billion of the securities, most of which were backed by the more risky subprime mortgages, the lawsuit says. ####  ##### “Not only was AIG brought down by 'unconscionable bets' that went terribly wrong, plaintiffs suffered tens of billions of dollars of losses, at the least, based on false and materially misleading statements that AIG, certain of its executives, directors, underwriters and outside auditor made concerning the company's financial results, business operations and condition,” the Nuveen funds said in the lawsuit. ####  ##### The U.S. Justice Department decided not to take action against certain AIG executives involved in the company's swap activities despite a two-year investigation, according to reports in 2010. ####  ##### The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission extended monitoring of the company following the subprime crisis. The monitoring began in connection with the 2006 settlement of separate unrelated fraud charges brought by the New York attorney general. ####  ##### Lynne Marek writes for Crain's Chicago Business, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Demand for insurance-linked securities spurs innovative investment structures","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### Stronger demand for insurance-linked securities is putting pressure on traditional reinsurers, spurring innovation as reinsurers and brokers develop novel investment structures for institutional investors and the hedge fund managers who invest on their behalf. ####  ##### This surge in insurance-linked securities is evident in the increased issuance of catastrophe bonds. According to a Swiss Re Ltd. report released in July, the total value of outstanding catastrophe bonds as of July 1 was $17.1 billion, exceeding the previous full-year record of $17 billion set in 2007 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ####  ##### Unlike the upswing in the catastrophe bond market after Katrina, however, market dynamics now are being driven by investor demand from a variety of new sources, most notably institutional investors and traditional money managers. ####  ##### “Everything is changing in the insurance-linked securities market, from the size of deals to the players involved,” said Tim Faries, a partner in the insurance group at Appleby Global Group Services Ltd., a Hamilton, Bermuda-based financial services firm that advises on insurance-linked securities. ####  ##### “Historically, our market was dominated by single-strategy hedge funds,” said Judith Klugman, head of insurance-linked securities distribution and sales for Swiss Re. “They have been extremely successful and still make up a big percentage of our market, but that is beginning to shift as more generalist money managers take an interest.” ####  ##### The mix of institutional investors investing in catastrophe bonds and other securities linked to insurance now includes more pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “What we've seen is that pension funds have largely been behind the capital that has continued to flow into the market,” said Chicago-based Paul Schultz, CEO of Aon Benfield Securities. ####  ##### Institutional investors increasingly have become enamored with insurance-linked investment strategies because catastrophe bond annual investment returns tend to fall in a range between 7% and 8%, topping ho-hum returns of traditional fixed-income securities in a low interest-rate environment — and they are uncorrelated with financial markets. The biggest investment area for institutions and hedge funds has been catastrophe bonds, by far the largest segment of insurance-linked securities, but there are other investments such as industry loss warrants and sidecars. ####  ##### Increased transparency and education, as well as structural changes, have increased investor and issuer comfort with insurance-linked securities, sources said. ####  ##### For example, a higher percentage of catastrophe bonds now use indemnity triggers, based on the losses suffered by the bond issuer and have gained popularity at the expense of both parametric triggers, which rely on measures such as wind speed to trigger the bond and indexed triggers, based on an industrywide index of losses, Ms. Klugman said. ####  ##### “What we are finding is that as our investors have become more sophisticated, there is a greater acceptance of indemnity triggers,” she said. ####  ##### Two of the most recent institutional investors to jump into insurance-linked securities are: ####  ##### • The $13.2 billion West Virginia Investment Management Board, Charleston, which invested $40 million in Chicago-based Elementum Advisors L.L.C.'s specialist catastrophe reinsurance hedge fund; and ####  ##### • The 23 billion New Zealand dollar ($18 billion) New Zealand Superannuation Fund, Auckland, which committed up to $275 million in London-based Leadenhall Capital Partners L.L.P.'s property catastrophe hedge fund, having previously invested $250 million in 2010 in Elementum's hedge fund. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On a short-term basis, Aon Benfield's Mr. Schultz said demand for catastrophe bonds has experienced ebbs and flows. ####  ##### “In the early part of the year, there was significantly more capital looking to be deployed than transactions coming to market. Since then, we've seen a healthy stream of issuances, and supply and demand is now about the same,” Mr. Schultz said. ####  ##### Aside from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund's outsized $500 million investment, most institutional reinsurance allocations are fairly small, in the $30 million to $50 million range, sources said. ####  ##### Over the long haul, the aggregation of even such small investments has the potential to crowd out the traditional sources of reinsurance market capital, sources said. ####  ##### Currently, only 15% of the total $300 billion property catastrophe reinsurance market now is from nonreinsurance industry sources known in the industry as “alternative capital,” according to an estimate by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research in its “The Search for Creative Destruction” report distributed Aug. 7. However, if pension funds with an estimated $2 trillion of aggregate assets allocated just 50 basis points of their funds to property catastrophe investments, the resulting $100 billion would be more than double the existing amount of alternative capital in the reinsurance industry, according to the report. ####  ##### “The total amount of pension fund assets so dwarfs the size of the whole reinsurance industry. Even a small fraction of those trillions would completely swamp the reinsurance industry,” said Michael Luft, managing director and consultant for insurance-linked securities at investment consultant Rocaton Investment Advisors L.L.C., Norwalk, Conn. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The volume of new capital flowing into their reinsurance space already has altered the supply/ demand dynamic and driven the cost of issuing bonds down relative to traditional reinsurance, said David Foley, global practice leader of actuarial and advanced analytics for Deloitte Consulting L.L.P. ####  ##### “The frictional cost of catastrophe bonds is falling,” Mr. Foley said. “So even from a price standpoint, they are becoming competitive with traditional reinsurance.” ####  ##### This diminishing price differential has prompted differing reactions from reinsurers. ####  ##### “Some traditional reinsurance players are following the adage of 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em' and investing in building teams that are capital markets desks,” Appleby's Mr. Faries said. ####  ##### Conversely, during a July conference call with equity analysts, Evan Greenberg, CEO of Zurich-based insurer and reinsurer Ace Ltd., said his insurance company was being more selective about writing reinsurance as the influx of alternative capital has exerted downward pressure on rates, especially in catastrophe-exposed regions. ####  ##### “You see alternate capital coming in, capital markets in addition to traditional players,” Mr. Greenberg said. “So you've got that pond, with more drinking out of it.” ####  ##### Bill Kenealy is an associate editor at Business Insurance; Christine Williamson is a senior reporter at sister publication Pensions & Investments. #### "

"Insurers don't have to pay for Land O'Lakes environmental cleanup: Court","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers, Liberty Mutual, The Travelers Cos."," ##### Units of Liberty Mutual Holding Co. Inc. and Travelers Cos. Inc. initially breached their duty to Land O'Lakes Inc. for failing to provide defense coverage for an environmental cleanup, but Minnesota's statute of limitation bars the agricultural cooperative from pursuing litigation on the issue, an appellate court ruled Thursday. ####  ##### Midland Cooperatives Inc. owned an oil refinery in Cushing, Okla., from 1943 until 1977, according to the ruling in Land O'Lakes Inc. v. Employers Insurance Co. of Wausau et al. by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. ####  ##### In 1977, the facility was sold to Hudson Oil Refinery Co., which abandoned the refinery in 1982 and went bankrupt in 1984. Arden Hills, Minn.-based Land O' Lakes acquired Midland in 1982, including the now-dormant refinery, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In July 1999, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the refinery as a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. ####  ##### In January 2001, the EPA sent Land O'Lakes a special notice letter informing it that it was considered a “potentially responsible party” under CERCLA and thus potentially liable for cleanup costs at the site. ####  ##### Land O'Lakes responded to the letter by asserting Hudson Oil, not Midland, caused any contamination at the refinery site, but nevertheless notified Wausau, a unit of Boston-based Liberty Mutual and Hartford, Conn.-based Travelers Indemnity Co. of the EPA's claims and sought defense and indemnification. Both insurers denied coverage. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In 2008, the EPA sent Land O'Lakes a second special notice letter inviting it to enter negotiations regarding the continued cleanup activities at the refinery. Land O'Lakes reiterated its denial that Midland had caused any contamination at the site and again asked the insurers for defense and indemnification, which both once again denied coverage. ####  ##### Land O'Lakes did initiate cleanup activities at the site. It filed breach of contract lawsuits against the insurers in 2009. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit upheld a ruling by the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis that Minnesota's six-year statute of limitations began with the EPA's 2001 letter, and therefore the cooperative could not pursue its litigation. ####  ##### Land O'Lakes argued that the 2001 letter was nothing more than an “invitation to participate in an investigation into whether remediation would be necessary at the refinery site. We disagree,” said the ruling. ####  ##### Instead, the 2001 letter “marked the beginning of an adversarial administrative process that ultimately sought to impose liability upon Land O'Lakes for remediation costs associated with the refinery site,” said the unanimous ruling. ####  ##### “We agree with the district court that the insurers breached their duty to defend in 2001” because the EPA's later “was a 'suit' for arguably-covered damages as contemplated under the pertinent (comprehensive general liability) policies” and that the EPA's 2008 letter “was not the commencement of an entirely new enforcement action. We, therefore, hold that 2009's duty-to-defend claims were barred by the Minnesota statute of limitations.” ####  ##### The appellate court also upheld the lower court's ruling that the owned-property exclusion in the policies relieved the insurers from any duty to indemnify Land O'Lakes for the cleanup costs. #### "
"Blackstone to pay $85M to settle lawsuit over IPO","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — Blackstone Group L.P. has agreed to pay $85 million to settle an investor class action lawsuit accusing the private equity giant of not disclosing bad investments before its $4.7 billion initial public offering in 2007. ####  ##### The proposed deal follows more than five years of litigation between investors and Blackstone and helps the world's largest private equity firm avert a rare securities class action trial that was due to begin Sept. 16. ####  ##### The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, also covers claims against individuals including Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone's chief executive. ####  ##### Blackstone spokesman Peter Rose declined to comment. The company continues to deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, court papers state. ####  ##### Lawyers for the plaintiffs said in court papers the settlement represents about 12 percent of the $691.5 million they believed were achievable at trial. ####  ##### Investors contended Blackstone did not properly disclose at the time of offering that its investments in a bond insurer, a semiconductor company and real estate were declining in value. ####  ##### As a result, investors alleged that there was an increased risk Blackstone's potential performance fees would be ""clawed back"" by limited partners. ####  ##### Blackstone offered up 153 million common units at $31 a piece at the time of its June 2007 IPO. By the time plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in October 2008, they were trading at about $7.75 a unit. ####  ##### Shares in Blackstone closed up 25 cents, or 1.17%, at $21.65 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Harold Baer, who must approve the settlement, initially dismissed the case in September 2009. ####  ##### But in February 2011, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York revived the case.

"'Not that pretty' city attorney can pursue sex, age discrimination charges","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A terminated attorney for the city of Evanston, Ill., who was told she was “not that pretty” by one of her supervisors, can pursue sex and age discrimination charges against the city, says a federal judge. ####  ##### Elke Tober-Purze had received excellent performance evaluations and was never disciplined before her termination in August 2010, according to a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge John W. Darrah in Chicago in Elke Tober-Purze v. City of Evanston that was issued Aug. 21 but publicized only this week. ####  ##### “In late 2009, despite her superior experience, Evanston hired W. Grant Farrar as its city attorney, instead of Tober-Purze or many other qualified females,” said the ruling. “Many female employees were terminated during Tobe-Purze's employment with Evanston. Moreover, many of the colleagues terminated during her employment were much older than the attorneys who replaced them. Since Farrar has been city attorney, he has hired male and younger female attorneys to replace Tober-Purze and other older, female attorneys,” says the ruling. ####  ##### In ruling that Ms. Tober-Purze could pursue her sex discrimination charge, the ruling says Ms. Tober-Purze was paid less than her male counterparts and did not receive the promotions they did. ####  ##### “She was also told by her superiors that she was ‘not that pretty’ and one superior told Tober-Purze that the previous attorneys he had hired were ‘smart … good-looking ... just gorgeous … (and wore) tight sweaters ... short skirts,’” said the ruling. She and other female attorneys were also told by a superior that “it’s been all downhill since women got the vote,” the ruling said. ####  ##### The judge also held Ms. Tober-Purze, who is more than 40 years old, could pursue her age discrimination charge as well as a charge that the city had violated the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act for not paying accrued vacation and sick time. The court said she could not pursue her claim for retaliation under the Wage Act because a private cause of action for retaliation did not exist under the statute when she was terminated in 2010. #### "
"Judge rules for Port Authority in asbestos defense involving AIG unit","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, AIG"," ##### A New York Supreme Court judge has granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, holding that an insurer's duty to defend covers an entire underlying action even if only some of the claims fall under the policy. ####  ##### The ruling involves a case brought by American Home Assurance Co. against the Port Authority, Alcoa Inc., Mario & DiBono Plastering Co. Inc., Tishman Speyer Properties L.P., Tishman Speyer Properties Inc. and other Tishman companies. ####  ##### The insurer's suit sought a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the defendants for asbestos-related injury claims stemming from the construction of the original World Trade Center. ####  ##### In its motion, the Port Authority said litigation against it alleged injury at the World Trade Center and non-WTC sites, but that American Home Assurance, a unit of American International Group Inc., had unilaterally begun limiting its defense obligations to the portion of defense costs dealing only with World Trade Center-related claims. ####  ##### American Home opposed the motion. It also argued that the policy had been exhausted, terminating its duty to defend. ####  ##### However, in her Aug. 15 ruling, Judge Eileen Bransten held that under New York state law, the duty to defend “extends to the entire action,” citing precedent that “if various grounds are alleged, some within and some without the coverage of the policy,” the insurer has a duty to defend the action on behalf of the insured. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The judge held that the Port Authority's right to recover the entire amount expended by American Home in defending the action can't be diminished because there might be additional insurers that also have a duty to defend. ####  ##### “The court concludes that American Home's duty to defend extends to the entirety of those WTC asbestos claims asserting claims covered by the policy,” the judge wrote. ####  ##### Regarding American Home's assertion that the policy had been exhausted, the judge ruled that the duty to defend continues even after the policy's indemnity limits are exhausted unless the policy expressly limits the duty to defend. ####  ##### “American Home points to no provision of the policy terminating defense costs upon exhaustion of the liability limit,” the judge wrote. “A policy may expressly limit the duty to defend; however, American Home points to no such limitations here.” ####  ##### In her ruling, the judge also granted the Tishman defendants' motion to dismiss counts against them in the American Home action and denied a motion by Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., which had issued policies to Mario & DiBono Plastering, to intervene in the case. #### "

Mr. Wauthier explicitly blamed Mr. Ackermann in the note for putting him under pressure, said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann has described the allegations as ""unfounded"" but said he would leave to avoid damaging Zurich's reputation. He took over as chairman last year. The insurer said Mr. Ackermann had made a personal decision to leave. ####  ##### Sources said Messrs. Ackermann and Wauthier had clashed ahead of the company's second-quarter results in August over how they were presented. ####  ##### Mr. Wauthier, finance chief since 2011, mentioned the presentation of the results in his suicide note, a company source added. ####  ##### In a conference call with investors, the company said there was no link between Mr. Wauthier's death and Zurich's financial performance. ####  ##### ""We stand by everything we said at the half year,"" Chief Executive Martin Senn said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Acting Chairman Tom de Swaan said the company would investigate the circumstances leading up to Mr. Wauthier's death. ####  ##### ""The board sees it as its prime responsibility to look into the question as to whether there was undue pressure placed on our CFO,"" he said, adding that he was not aware of any inappropriate behavior by Zurich's board members. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann's abrupt departure comes on top of a period of flux among Zurich Insurance's upper echelons. Its life insurance chief, Kevin Hogan, left two weeks ago to join American International Group Inc. as head of consumer insurance, and former general insurance head Mario Greco quit a year ago to lead Italian insurer Generali Group. ####  ##### ""The board is well aware of the need to strengthen the management team, and I consider this to be our top priority,"" said Mr. de Swaan, who was vice chairman under Mr. Ackermann. ""Our focus is on ensuring the continued stability of the company."" ####  ##### The company has set up a telephone hotline for employees shaken by the death of Mr. Wauthier, a married father of two. ####  ##### Shares in the group, the worst performing insurance stock in Europe over the past six months, rose over 1.5% after the conference call, snapping a four-day losing streak, with investors saying Mr. Ackermann's departure would not derail things. ####  ##### ""Ackermann has not been there for a long time. He's not the architect of anything, and this is not a company in a big transition,"" said one Top 20 shareholder. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The investor, who declined to be named, said Mr. Ackermann's openness about why he was resigning was actually reassuring. ####  ##### ""I was quite surprised at the statement and the references to Pierre's family. Normally, you see a holding statement,"" he said. ####  ##### ""What he said was better than if he just walked without saying anything, because then it would look like perhaps there was a hole or that something was wrong with the accounts. Not so much a cover-up but that something might have been found in the company."" ####  ##### The suicide scandal comes at a tough time for the company. Two weeks ago, Zurich reported a 17% slide in first-half net profit and it said low investment returns meant it would miss some targets. ####  ##### The company's shares had fallen close to 11% in the past six months, compared with a near 10% increase in the European insurance index. ####  ##### A former colleague of Mr. Wauthier's said there had been pressure within the company to turn around its share performance. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann took on the chairmanship of Zurich Insurance after failing to become chairman at Deutsche Bank. ####  ##### There was some surprise that the Swiss national opted for a relatively low-profile role in insurance rather than aiming for a top spot at one of Switzerland's banks. ####  ##### But the 65-year-old moved to shake up Zurich Insurance, which he felt was lagging behind European peers. Unlike previous chairmen, he took a very close interest in the finer details of results and accounts. ####  ##### Former colleagues of Mr. Ackermann say he does not court confrontation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""I have never seen Mr. Ackermann lose his cool at a meeting. But if you were underperforming, he had a way of communicating it without having to spell it out in a way which was personal. You talked about the numbers, and they told you everything you needed to know,"" said one senior banker, who declined to be named. ####  ##### While he is credited with transforming Deutsche Bank into an investment banking powerhouse during a decade-long tenure, Mr. Ackermann is no stranger to controversy. ####  ##### Last month, he lost a power battle at Siemens A.G., where he is a nonexecutive director, over the ousting of Chief Executive Peter Loescher, and he faces the prospect of being dragged into a legal row over Deutsche's role in the collapse of the Kirch media empire over a decade ago. #### "
"Zurich under pressure in wake of CFO's suicide and Ackermann's subsequent exit","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Zurich, Switzerland"," ##### The abrupt resignation of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.'s chairman following the suicide of the company's chief financial officer puts pressure on the company's leadership and requires short- and long-term crisis management. ####  ##### To minimize the adverse effect of the events on the company, Zurich needs to clarify the relationship between former CFO Pierre Wauthier, who took his own life in August, and former Chairman Josef Ackermann, said Larry Walsh, vice chairman at the Alexandria, Va.-based strategic communications group Hawthorn Group L.C. ####  ##### Zurich has acknowledged that Mr. Ackermann was named in Mr. Wauthier's suicide note, and Mr. Ackermann cited it as a reason in his resignation letter. ####  ##### “The resignation raises more questions than it answers,” Mr. Walsh said. “It looks abrupt and unplanned.” ####  ##### In a conference call with analysts, Zurich Acting Chairman Tom de Swaan refused to comment on the content of the suicide note. ####  ##### “We have accepted the resignation of Joe Ackermann as chairman of the Board,” Mr. de Swaan said. “It was his decision based on his own personal reasons, and I do not want to speculate on those.” ####  ##### While he said he was not aware of any behavior on the part of Mr. Ackermann that would be considered inappropriate, published reports detailed “heated exchanges” and “long-simmering friction” between Messrs. Wauthier, 53, and Ackermann, 65, over how to explain the company's recent financial results. ####  ##### Mr. Walsh said the company needs to provide a more complete explanation. ####  ##### “You cannot speak to what motivated the CFO, but you have to talk about what prompted your chairman to resign,” Mr. Walsh said. “What the family thinks of his role doesn't go away just because he walks out the door.” ####  ##### Yet, during the conference call, Zurich CEO Martin Senn sought to push back on the perceived connection between the suicide and the insurer's business and financial performance. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In August, Zurich reported a 27% drop in first-half net income after incurring heavy natural catastrophe-related losses due to severe flooding in Europe and tornadoes in North America. ####  ##### “While the results were somewhat mixed, we continue to be very profitable and we continue to generate healthy cash flows,” Mr. Senn said during the conference call. “We have a strong and resilient balance sheet.” ####  ##### Nonetheless, Mr. de Swaan said the company would investigate the working relationship between Messrs. Wauthier and Ackermann. ####  ##### “The board sees it as a prime responsibility to look at whether there was undue pressure on our CFO,” he said. ####  ##### Competent short-term crisis management mixed with a clearly articulated strategic vision for the long term is imperative for Zurich to mollify investors and internal stakeholders, said an executive familiar with the company speaking on condition of anonymity. ####  ##### “When bad things happen, leaders have to step to the microphone and say, 'I'm in charge, here's the plan and everything will be OK,'” he said. “This is a situation that necessitates leadership and stability.” ####  ##### Mr. Senn said an ongoing strategic reassessment will be reported during the company's investor day in December. ####  ##### “Our strategy remained unchanged by recent events,” Mr. Senn said. ####  ##### Yet some remain unsure of the company's strategic direction and the board's ability to help senior management chart a course. ####  ##### Andrew Barile, Savannah, Ga.-based CEO of insurance consultancy Andrew Barile Consulting Corp., cited a lack of insurance industry experience among directors on the company's board. ####  ##### “The board is really undermanned when it comes to understanding the insurance industry,” Mr. Barile said. “It's mostly bankers.” #### "
"Military contractor settles whistle-blower charges of improper testing","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A Florida firm has agreed to a settlement with a value of up to $4.4 million to resolve False Claims Act charges filed by whistle-blowers that it improperly tested equipment and electronic parts that are used by the military and NASA, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. ####  ##### Two whistle-blowers, who are former employees of St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Conax Florida Corp., will receive a total of $810,500 as a result of the settlement, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### The department said Conax and related companies improperly tested inertia reels and nonconforming voltage references. Inertia reels are part of a system designed to secure aircrew members in the event of a crash. On impact, they lock in place harnesses worn by aircrew members, preventing injury. Voltage references are electronic parts used in water-activated parachute releases. Both devices are used by the U.S. military and NASA, according to the Justice Department. ####  ##### The government charged the inertia reels were not tested in accordance with contractual requirement and that Conax used nonconforming voltage references. It said the voltage reference is an integral part of the water-activated parachute release, designed to protect unconscious or injured aircrew members who parachute into salt water. They are intended to automatically separate parachutes from aircrew members when they are physically unable to do so. If parachutes are not released, they may fill with water and drag crew members underwater. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement, Conax paid $2 million to the government. It also reached an agreement with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to provide the government with 4,969 new electronic parts for use with parachute releases, which are worth up to $2.4 million. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The whistle-blowers in the case, who had filed suit under the whistle-blower provision of the False Claims Act in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, are Mark Hansson and Steven Schummer. ####  ##### Stuart F. Delery, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, said in a statement, “Our military deserves equipment that is properly built and tested and meets specifications designed to ensure their safety.” ####  ##### Conax's parent company, Arlington, Va.-based Cobham P.L.C., said in a statement: “During the course of the government's investigation — which lasted more than four years — evidence was provided which resulted in the government declining to bring criminal charges. ####  ##### “The government pursued two of the many allegations in the complaint, with the company choosing to settle the civil false claims allegations for a minimal sum relative to the value of the contracts at issue. ####  ##### “Throughout the course of the investigation, the company maintained that its products posed no safety concerns, a position supported by the government's technical experts after thorough testing.” #### "
"Radiation oncology providers to settle whistle-blower suit for $3.5M","Risk Management","Health Care Benefits"," ##### Inter-related radiation oncology providers in Pensacola, Fla., will pay $3.5 million to the federal government and the state of Florida to settle charges in a whistle-blower suit that says they billed government programs, including Medicare, for radiation oncology services that were ineligible for payment. ####  ##### Most of the defendants say they have always provided appropriate health care. ####  ##### A whistle-blower will receive about $609,800 from the federal government's share of the settlement amount, according to the Department of Justice. ####  ##### The defendants, which included Sacred Heart Health System Inc. and West Florida Medical Center Clinic P.A., were charged, between 2007 and 2011, with regularly billing for radiation oncology services that were not supervised by a physician as required by Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE, which is the health care program for uniformed service members, retirees and their families, the DOJ said Friday. ####  ##### The DOJ said, in fact, these services often were performed while the defendant doctors were on vacation or working at another radiation oncology clinic. The government also charged that the defendants billed for other treatment services even when patients' medical records provided no evidence the services were rendered. ####  ##### They also allegedly billed twice for the same services and misrepresented the level of service provided to increase their reimbursement from the federal health care programs. ####  ##### According to the DOJ, Sacred Heart and West Florida Medical Center have been the sole shareholders of defendants Gulf Regional Radiology Oncology MSO L.L.C. and Gulf Region Radiation Oncology Centers Inc. since December 2007. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Sacred Heart was also a shareholder in Emerald Coast Radiation Oncology Center L.L.C. in Destin, Fla., which is about 60 miles from Pensacola. Also, beginning in December 2007, defendants Drs. Gerald Lowrey and Rod Krentel, who are both radiation oncologists, began providing physician services at Gulf Region Radiation clinics, and in June 2008, and began providing services at Emerald Coast Radiation. ####  ##### In addition to the overall settlement, Gulf Region Radiation and Drs. Lowrey and Krentel entered into integrity agreements with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General that are intended to deter wrongful conduct in the future, and require enhanced accountability and monitoring activities to be conducted by internal and independent reviewers, the DOJ said in its statement. ####  ##### The charges resolved by the settlement were first raised in a lawsuit filed against the defendants under the whistle-blower provisions of the False Claims Act. Whistle-blower Richard Koch, who previously worked at Gulf Region Radiation, will receive about $609,796 from the federal share of the settlement amount, said the DOJ. ####  ##### According to the settlement, which was filed in federal district court in Pensacola, there has still not been a settlement agreement as to a retaliation claim by Mr. Koch, as well as his attorneys' fees and expenses, and these remain pending. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Commenting on the settlement, Pamela C. Marsh, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee said in a statement, “Submitting false claims for medical services raises the cost of health care for all of us as patients and taxpayers. Patients, employees and others who suspect billing fraud on the part of health care providers should not hesitate to report such fraud to federal authorities. Health care providers – both corporations and individuals – must be held accountable when they submit false information.” ####  ##### Defendants other than the physicians said in a joint statement, “The settlement is not an admission of liability by (Gulf Regional Radiation), its owners, or the radiation oncologists. ####  ##### “We have disputed the lawsuit for the past 17 months and we are pleased to settle the matter and avoid further protracted litigation and substantial legal costs.” ####  ##### The statement said, “The defendants have consistently maintained that all of the care provided by the physicians and facilities was always safe, medically necessary and appropriate. ####  ##### “It is important to note that the lawsuit had nothing to do with the health care provided by Sacred Heart Hospital, Medical Center Clinic or the physicians of Sacred Heart Medical Oncology Group. The allegations involved the (Gulf Regional Radiation) facilities which are separate and jointly owned by Sacred Heart Health System and Medical Center Clinic.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The attorney for Dr. Lowrey, Brian E. Dickerson, a partner with law firm Roetzel & Andress P.A. in Washington, said: “The larger companies in this case felt it was more economical to settle this case than to fight it. There's no question of wrongdoing. The question at hand has nothing to do with standards of care and the quality of care provided to patients. ####  ##### “The issue is what (has been deemed) necessary to bill vs. what many of the medical professional associations deem necessary to review, and this ambiguity is causing this type of litigation and False Claim Act cases across the country,” Mr. Dickerson said. ####  ##### The attorney for Dr. Krentel could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Medical identity theft a growing problem: Survey","Risk Management","Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits"," ##### Medical identity theft is a growing problem, but many of the victims know the thief and do not want to report him or her, says a survey released Thursday. ####  ##### The number of victims affected by medical identity theft increased by an estimated 19% over the past year, to 313,000 new victims, and generated more than an estimated $12.3 billion in out-of-pocket expenses in 2013, according to the 2013 Survey on Medical Theft, which also reflected data from government agencies. ####  ##### The survey was conducted by the Traverse City, Mich.-based Ponemon Institute and sponsored by the newly formed Washington-based Medical Identity Fraud Alliance with support from Portland, Ore.-based data breach prevention and response specialist firm ID Experts. ####  ##### For purposes of the study, medical theft occurs when someone uses an individual's name and personal identity to fraudulently receive medical services, goods and/or prescription drugs, including efforts to commit fraudulent billing. ####  ##### According to the survey of 788 adults who self-reported that they or close family members were victims of medical identity theft, the crime happened 30% of the time because the victims knowingly shared their personal identification or medical credential with someone they knew, and 28% of the time because a family member took their personal identification or medical credentials without consent. ####  ##### The survey found that 50% of the respondents were unaware that medical identity theft can create inaccuracies in their permanent medical records. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Of those who tried to resolve the incident, 35% said they worked with their health plan and/or insurer, and 31% with their health care provider. This took almost or year more, according to 36% of the respondents, and 48% said the crime is still not resolved. ####  ##### Robin Slade, development coordinator for the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance, said she hopes employers will help their employees understand the steps they can take to reduce their exposure to fraud, including talking to them about reviewing their insurers’ explanation of benefits “and why they should protect their medical insurance cards and safeguard their insurance-related paperwork, and what to do if it’s lost or stolen.” ####  ##### Ponemon Institute Chairman Larry Ponemon said, “It’s not in the employer’s interest to have fraud of any kind,” so clearly firms can educate their workers on this issue. Employers can also work with companies that are developing stronger identification credentials, such as identification cards that contain microchips, so there is a more effective authentication process, Mr. Ponemon said. This must be done in conjunction with the health care insurer, he said. ####  ##### Copies of the survey are available  here. ####  ##### Ms. Slade said the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance is a public-private partnership that includes health plans, health providers, technology firms and other service providers and is intended to address the issue of medical fraud. #### "
"BP faces pressure over Algeria gas plant attack","Risk Management","Terrorism, Energy, Political Risk"," ##### (Reuters) — Some foreign workers at an Algerian desert gas plant feared for their safety well before Islamist militants killed dozens at the site, and relatives and survivors want joint operator BP P.L.C. to investigate its own security record. ####  ##### Forty oil workers, all but one foreign, died at In Amenas, Algeria, in January after the militants took expatriates hostage during a four-day siege that ended when Algerian forces stormed the site. ####  ##### BP and Norway's Statoil ASA, partners in the joint venture with Algerian state energy firm Sonatrach, have said it was impossible to predict an attack of such unprecedented scale. ####  ##### However, the widow of one British victim said her husband had expressed worry in an email sent about seven weeks before the surprise raid on Jan. 16 that a labor dispute at the plant had undermined security and could lead to serious violence. ####  ##### Contractor Garry Barlow was evacuated when tensions rose during the strike at In Amenas. According to his widow, Lorraine, he returned after his managers at the joint venture assured him it was now safe, but died within weeks on his 50th birthday during the siege in which four BP staff were also killed. ####  ##### A lawyer representing mostly British survivors and families of the victims has also said his clients wanted answers from BP over possible security failings, and said some were considering suing the company for negligence and breach of duty of care. ####  ##### None has yet sued. In an emailed response to Reuters questions, BP said: ""We can't comment on speculative legal action. However, BP will vigorously defend any such actions."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### BP has already set aside $42 billion for cleanup costs, fines and compensation for a blast and oil spill at a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. A trial of BP over the disaster three years ago is due to resume in the United States on Monday. ####  ##### Any compensation claims linked to In Amenas would be much smaller, but could further hurt BP's reputation if successful. ####  ##### London-listed BP said it had been unaware of any specific threat to the In Amenas project, or to British or Western interests in the area before the attack. ####  ##### While Statoil has already conducted and published its own inquiry, BP said it did not plan to follow suit. ""Because of the nature of the incident and the fact that the response was an Algerian military operation, there are many questions arising which BP is not in a position to answer,"" BP spokesman Robert Wine said in the email. ####  ##### British police were investigating the deaths of UK citizens on behalf of a coroner who will hold an inquest, he noted, adding that BP would cooperate with the coroner and review the outcome of official investigations for lessons to be learned. ####  ##### Widow Lorraine Barlow questioned BP's security procedures and decision-making before her husband Garry's death, calling on the group to follow the example of Statoil, which published the report on its high-level investigation on Sept. 12. ####  ##### Barlow told Reuters that Garry, who as a contractor was not directly employed by BP, had become worried about his safety last year when tensions rose over the industrial dispute with local drivers, who had begun to bring their relatives on site. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### His fears were laid out in the email to his sister on Nov. 30 after many expatriates had already been evacuated or ""demobbed"" in the industry jargon. ####  ##### ""Situation is getting dodgy here, local drivers have been on strike for 6 months, they are now on hunger strike, place is practically crippled and can't go on much longer,"" he wrote in an email tinged with black humor that British lawmaker Rosie Cooper read out in parliament on June 12. ####  ##### ""Local Tuareg have said that if any of the hunger strikers die then they will kill 30 expats at the In Amenas gas plant. As most expats have been demobbed, there are only 10 of us left, they must be planning to kill us all three times over, ha ha."" ####  ##### The Tuareg community are traditionally nomadic people who inhabit the Sahara desert mainly in Algeria, Mali and Niger. ####  ##### According to Statoil's report, written by staff and external security experts including a former acting director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the long-running dispute over contracts worsened in November when the hunger strike began. ####  ##### The drivers went back to work in return for a pay rise and contract extension the next month, but the report said joint venture managers had felt the deal was unlikely to last. ####  ##### Ms. Barlow said her husband was evacuated in early December 2012 and had not expected to go back as the situation was so tense. Garry had begun to look for other work when his managers told him the strike was over and it was safe to return, she said. ####  ##### ""He took their word for it,"" she told Reuters. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Garry was hired and paid through IOTA Group, a Swiss company that provides human resources services to the oil sector, but his widow said he worked for and was managed by the joint venture. ####  ##### BP said it was not previously aware of the email and there was no evidence the joint venture or shareholders were. ""There is no evidence that BP is aware of, that the drivers' strike had any connection to the incident,"" said Mr. Wine, the BP spokesman. ####  ##### The attackers were not from inside the facility but from the ranks of hardline guerrillas who have been waging jihad across much of the Sahara, and Algeria says they arrived at In Amenas from over the nearby border with Libya. ####  ##### However, locally hired workers who escaped the siege told Reuters at the time that the gunmen moved around the sprawling plant confidently, apparently familiar with its layout, raising questions about whether they had inside help. ####  ##### Algerian authorities have since arrested a man who had been employed at In Amenas and provided the militants with insider information, Algerian security sources said. ####  ##### Statoil's inquiry found security at the plant was inadequately managed, and a Norwegian union has said the firm's chief executive, Helge Lund, should consider resigning. Mr. Lund has said he did not plan to quit. ####  ##### Ms. Barlow, who will be represented by U.K. law firm Slater & Gordon at the inquest, said she did not intend to sue BP for compensation. However, she wanted to know the truth about how Garry was killed and whether more could have been done to protect workers at In Amenas. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""We need to know who made the decision to send them back, how that decision was made, what criteria were used to make that decision,"" she said. ""I know they could never have stopped the terrorists from coming, but was there anything that could have been in place that would have minimized what happened?"" ####  ##### The Statoil inquiry concluded that while the joint venture partners could not have prevented the attack, the Norwegian company, at least, was aware of the growing risks. ####  ##### It showed Statoil was concerned enough to order a risk consultancy report, delivered in July 2012, which suggested Algerian security forces were increasingly stretched and their ability to manage threats should be closely monitored. ####  ##### ""Regional political and security dynamics give rise to the credible threat of a one-off, high-impact terrorist incident in the oil-producing provinces,"" it quoted that report as saying. ####  ##### Michael Doherty, a quality control technician who survived the siege, said in a documentary by Britain's Channel 4 television that he had also been worried about security. ####  ##### ""I couldn't believe how inadequate that system was compared to other sites that I've worked in the world,"" he said. ""We were looked upon as a very vulnerable and easy target."" Reuters was not able to reach Mr. Doherty for comment. ####  ##### Controversy has also arisen over who was responsible for the safety of contractors like Mr. Barlow, who were not BP or Statoil staff but were hired through recruitment or other firms. ####  ##### In Amenas gas plant usually employs around 700 people, mostly Algerians. At the time of the siege, BP had about 20 people at the facility while Statoil had 17. There were also dozens of foreign contractors on the site. Six British nationals and a British resident were among those killed. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Trevor Sterling, a lawyer for Slater & Gordon, which is representing 37 people, both survivors and relatives of the dead, said British workers had felt reassured by BP's involvement in the project. ""Our clients would not have gone to work for Sonatrach. It was because it was BP. They felt safe because it was BP,"" he said. ####  ##### BP had not met contractors who survived or the families of contractors who died to try to build up a broader picture of what happened and avoid a repeat, he added. ####  ##### Mr. Wine said BP had debriefed its staff but contractors were employed through the joint venture, which is a separate entity. ####  ##### While BP said it would cooperate with the coroner, the inquest has yet to be held more than six months after the attack. At a preliminary hearing in July, coroner Penelope Schofield found there was insufficient information to set the scope of the inquest. ####  ##### The complexity of the case, involving a major incident on foreign soil and firms based in Algeria and Norway as well as the U.K. meant it had taken time for British police to gather information, the coroner's officer said. ####  ##### Another preliminary hearing is set for November and the inquest is likely to be held next year, he said. ####  ##### Even if the coroner sets the widest possible remit for the inquiry, as Ms. Barlow hopes she will, the inquest will not point a finger, although Slater & Gordon says it may provide more information and potentially offer grounds for legal action. ####  ##### ""The coroner must answer four questions: who died and where, when and how they met their death,"" said Geoff Charnock, officer at West Sussex coroner's service. ""This is not a court of blame."" #### "

Tolerating lewd or harassing behavior is not a job requirement and employers must provide a meaningful mechanism for employees to report such misconduct,” Delner Franklin-Thomas, district director of the EEOC's Birmingham, Ala., district office, said in a statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The company has denied the charges in the matter, according to the order filed in federal court in Tuscaloosa. ####  ##### WilcoHess attorney Kenneth P. Carlson Jr., a partner with law firm Constangy Brooks & Smith L.L.P. in Winston-Salem, said in a statement, “This was a settlement in which there was no liability admitted, and in which the purported ""class"" originally alleged by the EEOC was essentially cut in half by the court after an appropriate motion by WilcoHess. The company had proper policies in place, appropriately investigated the harassment allegations after a single anonymous complaint was faxed to the company's North Carolina headquarters, and took prompt remedial action. In other words, WilcoHess did what our laws require to help ensure a harassment-free workplace. The case was resolved strictly to avoid the time and expense of continued litigation."" ####  ##### Separately, an Alabama construction company that was accused of refusing to provide a ramp to a worker recovering from a leg fracture, and then firing her, has reached a $125,000 settlement with the EEOC. ####  ##### The agency said Thursday that Patricia Pittman, a former employee of Montgomery, Ala.-based Caddell Construction Co., had suffered a leg fracture that required surgery while working at Caddell's Eglin Air Force Base facility in Florida. ####  ##### After the surgery, the company refused her request for a wheelchair ramp to enter the office and to be allowed to use her crutches and a walker, and fired her days after her accommodation request, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The company was accused of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### Under the settlement agreement, in addition to paying Ms. Pittman the $125,000, Caddell agreed to provide training to its employees on its obligations under the ADA, among other measures. ####  ##### Caddell, which has denied the charges, said it terminated Ms. Pittman because her physical impairments prevented her from performing the essential functions of her job, according to the consent decree filed in federal court in Pensacola, Fla. ####  ##### A company spokesman could not be reached for comment. #### "

L.L.C. ####  ##### The alleged harassment was provoked by Mr. Woods' use of wet wipes instead of toilet paper, which Mr. Wolfe views as “kind of gay” and “feminine,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### After Mr. Woods complained about Mr. Wolfe's harassment to a supervisor in November 2006, Mr. Woods was sent home for three days without pay for reasons that are unclear, and upon his return was hired at a different Boh Brothers site. ####  ##### After he was laid off for lack of work in February 2007, Mr. Woods filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because of his removal from his original job. ####  ##### A U.S. District Court jury in New Orleans issued a verdict in Boh Brothers' favor on the retaliation claim, but on the sexual harassment claim awarded Mr. Woods $201,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages, with the former reduced to $50,000 because of a statutory damages cap. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Boh Brothers appealed. ####  ##### A unanimous three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit vacated the award. But the en banc court disagreed with the panel in a 10-6 ruling. ####  ##### In its ruling, the appellate court cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1989 Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins decision in which the high court held that a plaintiff can rely on gender-stereotyping evidence to show that discrimination occurred; and the Supreme Court’s 1998 ruling in Oncale v. Sundowner, in which it held that discrimination charges can be made when the plaintiff and defendant are of the same sex. ####  ##### “In sum, nothing in Oncale overturns or otherwise upsets the court’s holding in Price Waterhouse: a plaintiff may establish a sexual harassment claim with evidence of sex-stereotyping. Thus, the EEOC may rely on evidence that Wolfe viewed Woods as insufficiently masculine to prove its Title VII claim.” ####  ##### “There is enough evidence to support the jury’s conclusion that Wolfe harassed Woods because of sex,” said the majority ruling. “Specifically, the EEOC offered evidence that Wolfe, the crew superintendent, thought that Woods was not a manly enough man and taunted him tirelessly.” ####  ##### The court also held the harassment was severe and pervasive as a matter of law. “Wolfe hurled raw sex-based epithets uniquely at Woods two to three times a day,” said the court, in upholding the Title VII claim. ####  ##### It upheld dismissal of the punitive damages award, however, holding that Boh Brothers “did not subjectively perceive a risk of violation of federal law.” ####  ##### The case was remanded to the District Court to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s $201,000 compensatory damages award. #### "

"Railroad in Quebec explosion can operate until Feb. 1","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### The railroad involved in July's deadly derailment and explosion of a runaway train in Quebec has had a significant decline in the volume of commodities it transports, including the volume of dangerous goods, said a Canadian regulator Wednesday in extending its permit to continue operations until Feb. 1, 2014. ####  ##### The Ottawa, Ontario-based Canadian Transportation Agency in September said it had received a request from Hermon, Maine-based Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd., which was involved in the derailment that killed 46 people and destroyed much of central Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, to maintain its certificate of fitness until Jan. 15, 2014. ####  ##### Following this request, the railroad asked for an extension until Jan. 31, 2014. The agency said it has now decided there is adequate third-party liability insurance coverage, including self-insurance, for the proposed railway operations until Feb. 1, 2014. ####  ##### According to the decision, the railroad continues to have a self-insured retention of $250,000 in its liability insurance policy in addition to $25 million of third-party liability insurance coverage for any one occurrence and in the aggregate. ####  ##### The insurer is XL Insurance Co. Ltd., according to Robert J. Keach, a shareholder with law firm Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer & Nelson P.A. in Portland, Maine, who has been named the railroad's trustee. ####  ##### The agency also said during its review of proposed longer-term operations that it found “a significant decline” in the value of commodities transported by the railroad, including the volume of dangerous goods. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “This equates to a forecasted decrease of over 70% of total traffic with a reduction in the transport of dangerous goods of over 80%,” it said in its order. ####  ##### The order also said the volume of dangerous goods is expected to decline to 30% of its total traffic, from the preaccident level of 50%. ####  ##### The agency said the railroad has reduced the distance over which dangerous goods are carried by 90% by no longer transporting crude oil, “which also reduces the overall risk exposure. The greatly reduced volumes combined with much shorter distances over which dangerous goods are carried results in a significant reduction in (the railroad's) risk exposure,” said the decision. ####  ##### “We are very pleased by the extension and are encouraged that this provides our shippers the security and confidence in the railroad that they deserve,” Mr. Keach said in a statement. #### "
"Court justified in allowing similar prior suits as evidence in bias case","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A federal district court was justified in permitting evidence that a plaintiff in a racial harassment action had twice filed similar lawsuits against another employer, said a federal appellate court in a ruling. ####  ##### Rita Brown had filed a racial harassment action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Jabez Sport Clips La., L.L.C. in Houma, La., according to Friday’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Rita Brown v. Jabez Sport Clips La. L.L.C. ####  ##### At trial in September 2010, the court permitted the jury to learn that Ms. Brown had twice filed racial discrimination suits against another hair salon employer. A unanimous jury found Sports Clip employees did not harass the plaintiff, and the court entered judgment in the firm’s favor. ####  ##### Ms. Brown filed an appeal seeking a new trial on the basis that this evidence should have been excluded. In a January 2013 ruling, the federal district court in New Orleans denied the motion, and held that presenting that information was justified. ####  ##### A three-judge appellate panel unanimously agreed with the lower court. “The district court concluded that the probative value of the evidence of the ‘remarkably similar’ prior suits, together with evidence of potentially fraudulent activity associated therewith, substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice,” said the appellate panel. ####  ##### “We need not decide whether the district court erred in admitting the evidence because even if the court erred, the error was harmless. There was substantial other evidence weighing against Brown’s credibility and in favor of the jury’s verdict for the Sports Clips,” said the appellate court in affirming the district court’s ruling. #### "
"Chevron goes to trial in New York over $18B Ecuador award","Risk Management","Energy"," ##### (Reuters) — Chevron Corp. will try to convince a U.S. judge this week that a group of Ecuadorean villagers and their U.S. lawyer used bribery to win an $18 billion judgment against Chevron from a court in Ecuador, in the latest chapter in a long-running fight over pollution in the Amazon jungle. ####  ##### In a trial starting Tuesday, the oil company is asking a federal court in New York to prevent the villagers and their Harvard-educated lawyer, Steven Donziger, from using U.S. courts to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment. ####  ##### A victory in the United States would likely help Chevron's defense in other countries where Mr. Donziger and the villagers may seek to enforce the judgment. ####  ##### ""We believe that any jurisdiction that observes the rule of law will find that the judgment is illegal and unenforceable because it's a product of fraud,"" said Morgan Crinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron. ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the villagers say they did nothing wrong in obtaining the judgment, and they accuse the judge in the U.S. case, District Judge Lewis Kaplan, of bias against them. ####  ##### ""These claims by Chevron are utterly baseless,"" said Chris Gowen, a spokesman for Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans. ####  ##### The trial is the latest chapter in a dispute over environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field in northeastern Ecuador operated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001. ####  ##### Chevron says Texaco cleaned up its share of waste before turning the field over to state-owned Petroecuador. But in 2011, an Ecuadorean court awarded $18 billion to people from the village of Lago Agrio, which was affected by the pollution. The court subsequently increased the award to $19 billion to cover fees. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans have been unable to collect the award in Ecuador because Chevron no longer has operations there. ####  ##### In 2011, Chevron obtained an injunction from Judge Kaplan in New York blocking enforcement of the judgment anywhere outside Ecuador. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that ruling. ####  ##### In the lawsuit, Chevron accuses Mr. Donziger of violating the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and says both he and the villagers committed fraud. ####  ##### Central to Chevron's case is the evidence of a former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra. Judge Guerra said in a sworn deposition that he often wrote opinions for Judge Nicolas Zambrano, who issued the award to the villagers. ####  ##### Judge Guerra said Mr. Donziger and another lawyer pledged to pay Judge Zambrano $500,000 from whatever they collected from the judgment in exchange for allowing them to write it. Judge Guerra also said Judge Zambrano promised to share part of the bribe. ####  ##### Ted Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron, said the proceedings in Ecuador were ""one of the most egregious litigation frauds in history."" ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans say Judge Guerra has no credibility and say he is being paid for his testimony by Chevron. Mr. Donziger denies writing the judgment. ####  ##### ""We are completely and utterly denying the allegations by Chevron,"" his spokesman Mr. Gowen told reporters on Friday. ####  ##### ""Steven Donziger did not ghostwrite a judgment,"" Mr. Gowen said. ""Steven Donziger did not bribe a judge."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In January, Chevron said it relocated Judge Guerra's family to protect his safety and paid him $38,000 for the costs of providing his evidence. Chevron also confirmed that it agreed to pay Judge Guerra's family $10,000 per month for living expenses and $2,000 for housing. ####  ##### Judges Guerra and Zambrano are expected to testify at the trial, which is expected to last several weeks. ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans argue that the relief Chevron seeks — a ban on enforcing the Ecuadorean judgment in U.S. courts or profiting from it in any way — would violate the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' reversal of Judge Kaplan's 2011 injunction. ####  ##### They also say they are fighting an unfair battle. Chevron has overwhelmingly more resources. And Mr. Donziger and the villagers accuse Judge Kaplan of bias. In a court filing, they wrote that Judge Kaplan's ""contempt"" for Ecuador, ""its courts, and its laws has only grown more prominent over time."" ####  ##### The 2nd Circuit on Sept. 26 rejected their request to remove Judge Kaplan from the case. ####  ##### Earlier this month, Judge Kaplan ruled that the villagers and Mr. Donziger are not entitled to a trial by jury, as they had preferred, because Chevron waived damages claims against them. #### "

"Taser liability in teen's death affirmed, but damages get new trial","Risk Management",""," ##### A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court ruling on Taser International Inc.'s liability in the death of a teenager, but remanded the case for a new trial on the $5.5 million in damages awarded in the case. ####  ##### An incident involving 17-year-old Darryl Wayne Turner taking a bottle of water from the supermarket where he worked without paying for it kicked off an escalating series of confrontations with store management that ultimately led to his death after he was shot in the heart with a Taser by a Charlotte, N.C., police officer, according to Friday's ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in Tammy Lou Fontenot as administratrix of the estate of Darryl Wayne Turner and Devoid Turner v. Taser International Inc. ####  ##### Mr. Turner's mother filed a product liability lawsuit against Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser, alleging the company negligently failed to warn users of the risks posed by the X26 Taser used in the incident and, in particular, to warn them to avoid applying the electrical current near a subject's heart, which was the case with her son. She also alleged that the company's negligence resulted in her son's death. ####  ##### A federal jury in Charlotte, N.C., found in her favor and awarded her $10 million in compensatory damages, which the court lowered to $6.15 million. After reducing the award to account for funds Ms. Fontenot had received from a workers compensation award and a settlement with the City of Charlotte, the court awarded $5.5 million. ####  ##### Taser appealed. ####  ##### In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court panel affirmed the lower court's judgment upholding the jury verdict that imposed liability on the company for its negligence. ####  ##### It said the X26 Taser used in the incident “had been the subject of several academic studies. (Taser International) knew about these studies, in which researchers had concluded that the device posed a risk of ventricular fibrillation, a cause of cardiac arrest, especially when the electrical current from the Taser was applied near the subject's heart. Nevertheless, (Taser International) failed to warn Taser users to avoid deploying the Taser's electrical current in proximity to the heart.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In holding there should be a new trial on damages, the appeals court said, “We have no doubt that Turner had significant value to his parents, and that they are entitled to a substantial award for the loss of his services, care, and companionship. ####  ##### “However, we cannot agree that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Fontenot, met the required 'reasonable level of certainty' to establish that such services, care and compensation had a monetary value approaching $6.15 million.” ####  ##### The district court “abused its discretion,” the appeals court said in remanding the case for a new trial on damages. ####  ##### In a separate ruling in 2012, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that based on the information available at the time, Taser International could not be held liable for not issuing warnings that repeated exposure to its product could lead to death, in upholding dismissal of a 2004 wrongful death lawsuit. #### "

"JPMorgan warns 465,000 card users on data loss after cyber attack","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. is warning some 465,000 holders of prepaid cash cards issued by the bank that their personal information may have been accessed by hackers who attacked its network in July. ####  ##### The cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment compensation and other benefits. ####  ##### JPMorgan said on Wednesday it had detected that the servers used by its www.ucard.chase.com website had been breached in the middle of September. It then fixed the issue and reported it to law enforcement. ####  ##### Bank spokesman Michael Fusco said that since the breach was discovered, the bank has been trying to find out exactly which accounts were involved and what information may have been compromised. He declined to discuss how the attackers breached the bank's network. ####  ##### Mr. Fusco said the bank was notifying the cardholders, who account for about 2% of its roughly 25 million UCard users, about the breach because it couldn't rule out the possibility that their personal information was among the data removed from its servers. ####  ##### The bank typically keeps the personal information of its customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution. However, during the course of the breach, personal data belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain text in files the computers use to log activity. ####  ##### The bank believes ""a small amount"" of data was taken, but not critical personal information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and email addresses. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity theft. Many states require banks to notify customers if they believe there is any chance that such information may have been taken in a breach. ####  ##### The bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free credit-monitoring services. ####  ##### The warning only affects the bank's UCard users, not holders of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid Liquid cards. ####  ##### Mr. Fusco said the bank had not found that any funds were stolen as a result of the breach and that it had no evidence that other crimes have been committed. As a result, it was not issuing replacement cards. ####  ##### The spokesman declined to identify the government agencies and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach. ####  ##### Officials from the states of Louisiana and Connecticut said the bank notified them this week that personal information of some of their citizens may have been exposed. ####  ##### Louisiana citizens included about 6,000 people who received cards with state income tax refunds, plus 5,300 receiving child support payments and 2,200 receiving unemployment benefits, according to a statement from state Commissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols on Wednesday. ####  ##### Ms. Nichols said Louisiana would ""hold JP Morgan Chase responsible"" for protecting the rights and personal privacy of the citizens. ####  ##### Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier said she was ""dismayed"" that the bank took two and a half months to notify the state of the problem. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""JPMorgan Chase has some work to do, not only to assure the holders of its debit cards, but also to restore the state's confidence in the company's ability to remain worthy of our continued business,"" Ms. Nappier said in a statement on Thursday. ####  ##### The bank said it didn't know who was behind the attack, though the Secret Service and FBI were investigating the matter. ####  ##### Businesses and government agencies are increasingly using prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks. ####  ##### Yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all kinds have created new risks. In 2007, some 41 million credit and debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner of T.J. Maxx stores, were stolen. ####  ##### In May of this year, U.S. prosecutors said a global cyber crime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from automated teller machines in 27 countries. #### "
"Three Britons plead not guilty to Libor-rigging charges","Risk Management","United Kingdom"," ##### (Reuters) — The first three men to face trial in connection with a global investigation into a rate-rigging scandal that has rocked the financial industry pleaded not guilty in court on Tuesday. ####  ##### Tom Hayes, a former UBS A.G. and Citigroup Inc. trader has been charged with eight counts of conspiring with staff from at least 10 major banks and brokerages to manipulate Libor benchmark interest rates between 2006 and 2010. ####  ##### Terry Farr and James Gilmour, former RP Martin brokers who were arrested alongside Mr. Hayes in Britain last December and later also charged with two and one count of conspiracy to defraud, respectively, by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, also pleaded not guilty. All three are out on bail. ####  ##### The pleas pose a challenge to SFO head David Green, who has staked his reputation on the success of high-profile investigations such as the sprawling investigation into the manipulation of benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. ####  ##### U.S. and European authorities have fined 10 banks and brokerages around $6 billion to date and have charged seven men with criminal offences in connection with the rate-rigging scam. Regulators are also now investigating how other benchmarks are set, such as in foreign exchange and swaps markets. ####  ##### Libor rates, designed to reflect the wholesale cost of loans, are used to help to price hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of financial products worldwide, ranging from derivatives to mortgages. ####  ##### Prosecutors allege Mr. Hayes conspired to defraud with staff of UBS, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Scotland, ICAP, Tullet Prebon, at least one employee of Deutsche Bank A.G., Rabobank and HSBC Holdings P.L.C., Messrs. Farr and Gilmour and another employee of RP Martin while he worked in Japan. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""They dishonestly agreed to procure or make submissions of rates ... which were false or misleading in that they were intended to create an advantage to the trading position of Tom Hayes and others and deliberately disregarded the proper basis for the submission of those rates, thereby intending to prejudice the economic interests of others,"" the indictment alleges. ####  ##### Judge Jeremy Cooke set a trial date for Mr. Hayes for January 2015. The trial of Mr. Hayes, who last December was also charged with fraud-related offences by U.S. prosecutors, could take 12 weeks, lawyers said. ####  ##### The provisional trial date of Messrs. Farr and Gilmour, which is expected to take around six weeks, has been set for September 2015, in part to allow the SFO time to bring a case against further alleged co-conspirators. ####  ##### Mr. Green had been hoping to charge more individuals in connection with the Libor investigation around this autumn. ####  ##### UBS, which paid $1.5 billion to U.S. and European regulators last year to settle Libor-rigging charges — the biggest Libor-related fine to date — declined to comment, as did Citigroup and ICAP. ####  ##### RP Martin, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and JPMorgan also declined to comment. Tullett Prebon and HSBC did not immediately respond to requests for a comment. ####  ##### Mr. Hayes joined Swiss bank UBS in Tokyo in 2006, becoming a senior trader of interest-rate derivatives indexed to yen-denominated Libor. In late 2009, he left UBS to join Citigroup in Tokyo. He left the U.S. bank less than a year later. ####  ##### While Mr. Hayes was at UBS, Messrs.

"New York accuses Novartis of making kickbacks to up drug sales","Risk Management",""," ##### New York's attorney general has accused Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. of paying kickbacks to a New York-based pharmacy company to boost sales of iron-reduction drug Exjade. ####  ##### In response, East Hanover, N.J.-based Novartis said in a statement that it is “dedicated to improving patient health and supports medication adherence program integral to this goal.” ####  ##### Separately, on Thursday, an appeals court upheld a $225,000 jury verdict against Novartis in a product liability lawsuit. ####  ##### Aside from the suit against Novartis, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in a Wednesday statement that the pharmacy, Elmsford, N.Y.-based BioScrip Inc., has agreed to pay $15 million to cover costs to Medicaid and Medicare nationally for excessive Exjade prescriptions.

"Researchers uncover cyber spying campaign dubbed 'The Mask'","Risk Management","Spain, France, Latin America, Russia, United Kingdom, Brazil"," ##### (Reuters) — A computer security software firm has uncovered what it calls the first cyber espionage campaign believed to be started by a Spanish-speaking country, targeting government agencies, energy companies and activists in 31 countries. ####  ##### Dubbed ""The Mask,"" the campaign had operated undetected since 2007 and infected more than 380 targets before it stopped last week, Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab said on Monday. ####  ##### The firm declined to identify the government suspected to be behind the cyber spying, but said it had been most active in Morocco, followed by Brazil, the United Kingdom, France and Spain. ####  ##### The suspected involvement of a Spanish-speaking nation is unusual as the most sophisticated cyber spying operations uncovered so far have been linked to the United States, China, Russia and Israel. Those nations have been said to be behind the Duqu, Gauss and Flame malware, for example. ####  ##### Kaspersky Lab said the discovery of The Mask suggests that more countries have become adept in Internet spying. The firm's researchers only came across the operation because it infected Kaspersky's own software. ####  ##### ""There are many super-advanced groups that we don't know about. This is the tip of the iceberg,"" Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky's global research team, said in an interview on the sidelines of a conference sponsored by his company in the Dominican Republic. ####  ##### Mr. Raiu said The Mask hit government institutions, oil and gas companies and activists using malware that was designed to steal documents, encryption keys and other sensitive files, as well as take full control of infected computers. ####  ##### The operation infected computers running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows and Apple Inc.'s Mac software, and likely mobile devices running Apple's iOS and Google Inc.'s Android software, according to Kaspersky Lab. ####  ##### There was no immediate comment from the companies. ####  ##### Kaspersky Lab said it worked with Apple and other companies last week to shut down some of the websites that were controlling the spying operation.

"GM more than doubles North American ignition-switch recall","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — General Motors Co. on Tuesday more than doubled a recall, mostly in North America, to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components including airbags to be unintentionally turned off. ####  ##### GM said it is aware of 31 reported incidents, including 13 front-seat fatalities, involving frontal crashes in which the condition may have caused or contributed to the front airbags not deploying. ####  ##### In expanding the recall to 1,620,665 vehicles in the United States, Canada and Mexico and a small number overseas, the No. 1 U.S. automaker also said it would review its recall process. It had previously recalled almost 779,000 cars. ####  ##### ""The process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been,"" GM's North American head, Alan Batey, said in a statement. ""We will take an unflinching look at what happened and apply lessons learned here to improve going forward."" GM said it submitted a detailed chronology associated with the initial recall to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday. ####  ##### All of the crashes occurred off-road and at high speeds, where the probability of serious or fatal injuries was high regardless of airbag deployment, a company spokesman said. Failure to wear seat belts and alcohol use also were factors in some cases, the spokesman said. ####  ##### The Detroit company previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the ""run"" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components. ####  ##### Earlier this month, GM said it was recalling 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 compact cars from model years 2005 through 2007. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On Tuesday, GM added 842,103 Saturn Ion compact cars from 2003 through 2007 model years, Chevy HHR mid-sized vehicles from 2006 and 2007, and the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007.

"U.S. Tax Court decision on Rent-A-Center deductions buoys captive owners","Risk Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives"," ##### SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — A U.S. Tax Court decision that allows a federal income tax deduction for premium payments by subsidiaries of Rent-A-Center Inc. to the company's Bermuda captive was not a “game changer” for captive owners. ####  ##### “But it is maybe the first inning of what could become a nine-inning game, and it came out favorably for the taxpayer,” said Thomas M. Jones, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery L.L.P. ####  ##### In Rent-A-Center Inc. v. Commissioner, the Internal Revenue Service argued that the company's captive was a sham entity established to generate federal income tax benefits. But the court found that Rent-A-Center's Bermuda-based Legacy Insurance Co. Ltd. captive is a genuine insurance company providing real risk transfer for the subsidiaries. ####  ##### “It's a little bit frustrating for our clients, because they say 'tell us the new rules,'” Mr. Jones said. But despite the court's Jan. 14 ruling, the advice that he and P. Bruce Wright, a partner at the Sutherland Asbill & Brennan L.L.P., would give clients in similar situations is it all comes down to individual “facts and circumstances,” Mr. Jones said. ####  ##### Their comments came during a session on complex tax issues during the Captive Insurance Cos. Association's 2014 International Conference, held March 9-11 in Scottsdale, Ariz. ####  ##### Even so, it was significant that 15 of the 16 the Tax Court judges decided the case, Mr. Jones said. It also was the first full court review of a captive premium deductibility case involving the so-called “brother-sister theory” since the 1987 Humana Inc. & Subs. v. Commissioner case, Mr. Jones said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In that case, the Tax Court did not allow Louisville, Ky.-based Humana to take a tax deduction for premiums paid to its captive, holding that risks that are either insured or reinsured by a related insurance company cannot be deducted from federal income taxes because the risk was not shifted from the policyholder. But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati overturned the decision in 1989. ####  ##### Mr. Jones said part of the reason the full Tax Court decided to review Rent-A-Center was because the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, not the 6th Circuit, would have decided any appeal. ####  ##### “So the tax court got all the judges together in a room to decide whether they thought that they were actually wrong back in 1987 and that Rent-A-Center should take advantage of brother-sister, or should they stick to their guns and say they were still right, which they could have done and rejected brother-sister,” Mr. Jones said. “Or as one of the dissenting judges I think rather sarcastically said, they could have avoided the whole thing by saying the IRS issued a revenue rule that accepts brother-sister in certain circumstances.” ####  ##### In 2001, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2001-31 that reversed its longstanding position that premiums paid to captives are not deductible under the “economic family” theory. ####  ##### “In any case, they tackled the hard thing. They admitted they were wrong,” Mr. Jones said. ####  ##### But because Rent-A-Center was not a unanimous decision and could easily have gone the other way.” he said. “In other words this is not money in the bank, it's just what we think might be the beginning of a trend. The brother-sister theory is now accepted in Tax Court.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Also during the session, Mr. Wright addressed attempts by the IRS to tax reinsurance transactions multiple times, a process he called “cascading tax.” ####  ##### Under a 2008 IRS revenue ruling, “every time a U.S. risk is transferred from one insurer to another, that is another taxable transaction” subject to federal excise tax, Mr. Wright said. “So for example, if an insurer reinsures with a Bermuda company, it's 4%; if the Bermuda company reinsures with another Bermuda company, it's 1% on the next transaction, and on and on.” ####  ##### In response, Bermuda-based Validus Reinsurance Ltd. filed a refund suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2013 arguing that the excise tax did not apply to retrocessions. In February this year, the court ruled for Validus. ####  ##### “The problem is, they may have won too much because the decision was based on retrocessions,” Mr. Wright said. “Let's assume a U.S. insured insures with an insurance company in the U.S. and that company reinsures with another company in the U.S. and that company reinsures with a Bermuda company. Now, based on the decision in this case, there is no excise tax on that transaction ... because it's a retrocession transaction.” ####  ##### Mr. Wright said he expects the IRS to appeal, and recommended that captive owners pay the excise tax on reinsurance transactions to avoid an IRS audit. ####  ##### The heavily attended session was part of the annual CICA conference that attracted more than 560 attendees and 49 exhibitors. #### "
"Speak CFO's language to get C-suite involved in risk management","Risk Management","Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers"," ##### NEW YORK — To engage the corporate leadership of an organization about insurance matters, risk managers must reach the chief financial officer, and to reach the CFO, one must speak the language of finance, according to a prominent insurance scholar. ####  ##### “Sometimes it seems to me that we are all reporting to a chief financial officer,” Jack Hampton, professor of business at St. Peter's University in Jersey City, N.J., and former executive director of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc., said Thursday at the Business Insurance Risk Management Summit in New York. ####  ##### “Does it make a difference if we speak the language of the CFO?” asked Mr. Hampton. Using a set of words tailored to catch the attention of the CFO could be a powerful tool in communicating about insurance needs and topics, he said. ####  ##### “You must teach finance people the total cost of risk,” said Mr. Hampton. ####  ##### He said any communication or presentation about insurance or risk management aimed at the CFO should highlight concepts with which the finance chief is familiar or on which he or she is focused, especially cost savings. ####  ##### “The financial component of the argument will get the CFO's attention,” Mr. Hampton said. “You must answer any questions with a financial foundation.” ####  ##### In fact, Mr. Hampton suggested that the two functions are similar and parallel. “Is it risk management, is it finance, or both?” he said. #### "
"Sick worker's FMLA lawsuit reinstated on appeal","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### An appeals court has reinstated Family Leave and Medical Act interference and retaliation charges filed by a worker who was terminated after he requested leave for his congestive heart failure. ####  ##### Alan Demyanovich, an employee of more than 20 years of Wyandotte, Mich.-based automotive firm Cadon Plating & Coatings L.L.C., had taken FMLA leave for health issues several times over the years, according to Friday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Alan Demyanovich v. Cadon Plating & Coatings L.L.C. et al. ####  ##### In February 2010, he again asked for leave, but his request was denied by the company's vice president because the executive believed the firm did not have the minimum 50 employees needed to have the firm become subject to the act, according to the ruling. Mr. Demyanovich claimed the vice president also told him he was a “liability.” His employment was terminated shortly thereafter. ####  ##### Mr. Demyanovich filed suit against the company, charging it with interfering with his FMLA rights, retaliation under the FMLA and disability discrimination under both federal and state law. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Detroit dismissed all the charges, stating, among other factors, that there was a question as to whether Cadon is covered by the FMLA and that Mr. Demyanovich was not an eligible employee under the act because he could not show he would have been able to work at the end of the 12-week FMLA leave period. ####  ##### The lower court also said Mr. Demyanovich had failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding his FMLA retaliation claim. ####  ##### Mr. Demyanovich appealed the ruling. ####  ##### In reinstating the case, a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit unanimously said that although Cadon had less than 50 employees, it is covered under FMLA because it is an “integrated employer” with Utica, Mich.-based MNP Corp., with whom it shares several common managers. ####  ##### The court also held that “although there is ample evidence that Demyanovich might have had difficulty returning to work” within 12 weeks of his Feb. 23 requested formal leave, “it is not indisputable that he would have been unable to do so.” ####  ##### “Because we find sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Cadon interfered with Demyanovich's right to FMLA leave without a legitimate reason for doing so, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cadon as to the FMLA interference claim,” said the appeals court. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On the retaliation claim, pointing to the vice president's statement that Mr. Demyanovich was a liability immediately after his FMLA leave request, the panel said he has “presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that he was terminated in retaliation for requesting FMLA leave.” ####  ##### The court also held there was sufficient evidence in the record for which a reasonable jury could conclude Cadon had discriminated against Mr. Demyanovich on the basis of his disability in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and Michigan's Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. ####  ##### The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings. #### "
"Britain charges three former ICAP brokers over Libor rigging","Risk Management","United Kingdom, Japan"," ##### (Reuters) — British fraud prosecutors began criminal proceedings against three former brokers from ICAP, the world's top interdealer broker, as the U.K. side of a global investigation into alleged rigging of crucial benchmark interest rates cranked up. ####  ##### The Serious Fraud Office said on Friday it was charging former ICAP derivatives broker Darrell Paul Read, his supervisor Daniel Martin Wilkinson and Colin John Goodman, a cash broker in ICAP’s London office, in connection with the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor. ####  ##### They SFO alleged in a statement that the three “conspired to defraud” between Aug. 8, 2006 and Sept. 7, 2010. ####  ##### They will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 15, when the charges will be read out, the SFO added. ####  ##### The three men, who have already been charged by U.S. prosecutors, bring to nine the number of people charged in Britain over the manipulation of Libor, a central cog in the global financial system. ####  ##### Thirteen men have been charged globally over the scam to date — 10 for alleged yen Libor manipulation and three for alleged dollar Libor manipulation. The inquiry into Libor and a related Euribor-rigging inquiry, which stretches from North America to Asia, has also seen U.S. and European regulators fine 10 banks and brokerages a total of $6 billion to date. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ICAP, which in September settled regulatory investigations into allegations of manipulation of yen Libor, declined to comment. ####  ##### Based on a survey of what banks would charge each other for loans, traders are alleged to have colluded on answers that could nudge the reported rates by amounts that were tiny but translated into big profits. ####  ##### Libor is the primary benchmark for short-term interest rates globally and is used as a reference rate for mortgages, credit cards, student loans and other consumer lending products that the Swiss-based Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has estimated to be worth around $450 trillion. ####  ##### ICAP is the world’s largest interdealer broker, an industry designed to match buyers and sellers of bonds, currencies and swaps without bias. ####  ##### But when the brokerage last September became one of 10 institutions fined by U.S. and European authorities — the penalties now total around $6 billion — regulators laid bare a world in which, they alleged, brokers deliberately infected markets with false information to benefit their top client. ####  ##### The SFO has already charged six other men as part of its Libor investigation, including Tom Hayes, a former yen derivatives trader at UBS and Citigroup, who pleaded not guilty in a London court in December. ####  ##### Hayes, who has also been charged by U.S. prosecutors, is due to stand trial in London in January 2015 on eight charges of conspiring with staff from at least 10 banks and brokerages to manipulate yen Libor rates between 2006 and 2010. ####  ##### %%Break%% ####  ##### Terry Farr and James Gilmour, two brokers from RP Martin, have also been charged and pleaded not guilty to similar fraud-related offences in Britain. Their trial has been scheduled for September 2015, in part to allow the SFO time to bring charges against further alleged co-conspirators. ####  ##### Although the sprawling Libor investigation has generated fewer headlines since authorities announced parallel inquiries into other benchmarks, such as those in foreign exchange and swaps markets, the long-awaited Libor charges are a reminder of the insidious nature of the alleged wrongdoing. ####  ##### ICAP also remains under investigation by the European Union antitrust regulator over the alleged rate-rigging scam. ####  ##### Regulators are also examining whistleblower allegations that other benchmarks, such as those governing foreign exchange, have been manipulated. #### "

Ms. Wells was a loyal employee who had worked at Wal-Mart for 11 years, but her developmental disability made her vulnerable to predatory sexual behavior. The EEOC is here to protect the rights of people like her, and we are pleased that Wal-Mart has come forward, at an early stage, to resolve this matter without the need for further litigation.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Wal-Mart said in a statement it “does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.

"Foundry agrees to pay $160,000 in racial bias case involving noose","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reached a $160,000 settlement with a foundry in a racial discrimination case in which a noose had been found on the premises, the agency said. ####  ##### The EEOC’s case against San Antonio-based AA Foundries Inc. was originally filed in September 2011 on behalf of four black employees, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### During a three-day trial in September 2012, a federal jury heard evidence that the plant superintendent, who was the top plant official, used racial epithets, and that a noose was displayed in the workplace after racial harassment charges were filed with the EEOC. According to a news report, the three workers never saw the noose, which was hung by another worker. ####  ##### The superintendent reportedly said, though, that the noose “was no big deal” and “you people are too sensitive” when workers complained. ####  ##### The jury found in favor of three of the black employees, who are male, and awarded them punitive damages totaling $200,000, later reduced to $140,000 because of statutory caps. It found no liability regarding a fourth black female employee. ####  ##### The court also granted the EEOC’s application for injunctive relief and “permanently enjoined” the firm from “engaging in any employment practice which facilitates, condones or encourages a hostile work environment on the basis of race.” It ordered AA Foundries to implement an effective policy prohibiting race-based discrimination and to conduct training. ####  ##### AA Foundries filed an appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in October 2012, according to the EEOC, and the EEOC filed a cross appeal on behalf of the female employee. ####  ##### The company subsequently withdrew the appeal and agreed to settle the case. ####  ##### The settlement, announced Wednesday, is for $160,000 to be divided among all four employees. The company also agreed to comply with the injunctive relief ordered by the court. ####  ##### “I am pleased the resolution incorporated the full judgment,” said EEOC general counsel David Lopez in a statement. “The jury, speaking as the conscience of the community, had sent a powerful message that racial discrimination is unacceptable. It is unfortunate that nearly 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this type of unlawful harassment persists, and the EEOC will continue to work to eliminate it once and for all.” ####  ##### The company’s attorney could not be reached for comment. #### "
"HP pays $108M to settle DOJ, SEC overseas corruption probes ","Risk Management","Regulation, Poland, Russia"," ##### (Reuters) — Hewlett-Packard Co. will pay $108 million and agreed to take on certain reporting and compliance obligations to settle a Justice Department and SEC investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been conducting investigations into HP’s conduct in Russia and Poland, among other countries.

"UBS unit must pay $5.4M to ex-broker who sold Lehman notes: Panel","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — A unit of UBS A.G. must pay $5.4 million to a former broker who alleged the firm misled its advisers about the financial health of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. while recommending they sell its structured notes to clients, a securities arbitration panel ruled. ####  ##### The $5.4 million includes a rare award of $1 million in punitive damages to the broker, according to a ruling late on Friday by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel. The panel also recommended erasing the details about 39 arbitration complaints from the broker's public disclosure record filed against UBS Financial Services Inc. by clients who bought the notes, known as principal protected notes, from the broker. ####  ##### ""UBS is disappointed with the panel's decision, and believes it to be legally and factually incorrect. The award is inconsistent with standards of practice and industry rules and regulations,"" a UBS spokesman said via email. The firm is evaluating its options, including whether to ask a court to overturn the ruling, the spokesman said. ####  ##### Principal protection notes are fixed-income securities that include a bond and an option component that offers a minimum return equal to the initial investment. They are tailored for risk-averse investors. ####  ##### The broker, Edward Dulin, worked for UBS in Scottsdale, Ariz., between 2000 and 2008, according to a regulatory filing. He sold Lehman principal protected notes to his clients before Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. Mr. Dulin represented the notes to his clients using information that UBS included in training materials and prospectuses for its brokers, said Rosemary Shockman, his lawyer in Phoenix. That included telling clients that their principal was protected, Mr. Stockman said. ####  ##### But the notes Mr. Dulin sold plummeted in value when Lehman filed for bankruptcy. Until then, Lehman had been Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank. ####  ##### Mr. Dulin is now a broker for Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit. ####  ##### Arbitrators included the $1 million punitive damages award in their ruling against UBS because the firm withheld material information about Lehman's ""sinking financial condition"" and continued to recommend the sale of the notes, according to the ruling. One of the three arbitrators who decided the case disagreed with the punitive damages award, according to the ruling. #### "

Inc. has assigned Torus Insurance Holdings Ltd.'s Wilmington, Del.-based Torus Specialty Insurance Co. and Torus National Insurance Co. units a negative outlook while affirming their financial strength rating of A-, Best said Friday. ####  ##### All ratings have been removed from being under review with negative implications, the Oldwick, N.J.-based rating agency said in a statement. ####  ##### The rating actions follow completion of the acquisition of London-based Torus by Enstar Group Ltd. and Stone Point Capital L.L.C. on April 1, and Best's review of the new owners' plans for the Torus group. ####  ##### Best said the positive rating factors supporting the affirmations include the support of Enstar and Stone Point, which are expected to provide strategic and operational support to Torus, as well as financial assistance if needed. Both have a proven track record of building strong and profitable insurance businesses, Enstar in insurance runoff and Stone Point in active underwriting, Best said in the statement. ####  ##### Best said that based on the group ratings, any future rating actions for Torus Specialty and Torus National will likely be in accordance with any future rating actions on Torus group. ####  ##### “Torus' consolidated historical financial performance, as well as those of Torus Specialty and Torus National, has been weak with overall losses made each year since 2010,” said Best in the rating announcement. “Management, supported by the group's new owners, is committed to improving financial performance and has taken actions to achieve significant expense savings as well as exiting underperforming lines of business. However, despite these actions, A.M. Best believes that achieving sustainable profitable results will remain a challenge, given the strong competition in Torus' main business lines.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Positive rating actions could follow if management delivers on its plan to improve financial performance for the Torus group of companies, Best said. Likewise, negative rating actions could follow if Torus continues to underperform against its own plans and A.M. Best's expectations, said Best. ####  ##### “We are very pleased that A.M. Best's review has concluded with an affirmation of our A.M. Best ratings,” said Torus CEO Dermot O'Donohoe in a statement. ####  ##### “This reflects our strengthened capital position following a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement with a subsidiary of Enstar, which covers Torus group's discontinued lines of business; as well as actions taken to discontinue the underperforming lines and achieve significant expense savings,” he said, adding that “we are confident that Torus, with the support of our new owners, Enstar and Stone Point, is now on a solid path to future success and profitability.” #### "
"Taser lawsuit in traffic stop death dismissed on appeal","Risk Management",""," ##### Taser International Inc. cannot be held liable for failing to issue an additional warning about the dangers of its Taser weapon in the death of a man killed with the device by police during a traffic stop, because the police officer involved had not even read already existing warnings, said an appellate court in dismissing the case. ####  ##### Officer Jeremy Baird of the Moberly, Mo., Police Department shot Stanley Harlan in the chest with a Taser electronic control device after a traffic stop on Aug. 28, 2008, according to Thursday's ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis in Athena Bachtel v. Taser International Inc. ####  ##### Mr. Harlan fell to the ground and appeared to lose consciousness. He was pronounced dead about two hours later, and a medical examiner determined the cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest that occurred shortly after the Taser's use. ####  ##### Ms. Bachtel, Mr. Harlan's mother, originally sued the city of Moberly and several police officers for excessive force and deliberate indifference, and that case was settled for $2.4 million in June 2009, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Bachtel then sued Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser in August 2011, charging the company was liable for not having provided adequate warnings that direct deployments of the device into the chest could lead to cardiac arrest, as well as for placing a defectively designed product on the market. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### To prevail on her strict liability claim for failure to warn, Ms. Bachtel needed to demonstrate both that the product caused Mr. Harlan's death and that a warning “would have altered the behavior of the officers involved in the incident,” said the appellate ruling. ####  ##### However, “We conclude that there is no genuine dispute on this record that Officer Baird would not have read any additional warning Taser may have added about the cardiac danger” of its device, said the ruling, observing that the officer had not read warnings the company had already issued. ####  ##### Turning to the design defect claim, the appellate court said, “Missouri courts have explained that under strict liability, a manufacturer is not intended to be an insurer of any and all injuries caused by its products.” ####  ##### “We conclude that Bachtel has failed to present evidence that the (Taser) used by Officer Baird was unreasonably dangerous as designed,” said the ruling. “The evidence Bachtel points to in her brief on appeal establishes only a link between the device and the injury,” it said. ####  ##### “Since Bachtel has failed to demonstrate any 'specific design choices' that rendered the (Taser model) unreasonably dangerous, her claim fails as a matter of law,” said a unanimous three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit in affirming a ruling dismissing the case by the U.S. District Court in Hannibal, Mo. ####  ##### Appellate courts have issued different rulings on the issue of Taser's liability. For instance, in November 2013 a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court ruling on Taser's liability in the  death of a teenager but remanded the case for a new trial on the $5.5 million in damages awarded in the case. #### "
"Despite hurdles, Delphi's liability in GM recall could be tested","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — Delphi Automotive P.L.C.'s name does not appear on the outside of the 2.6 million vehicles recalled by General Motors Co. since February, but the company is getting drawn into a mounting wave of litigation for its role in producing the faulty ignition switch that prompted the recalls. ####  ##### Plaintiffs have now named Delphi, one of the largest auto parts suppliers in the world, in at least two lawsuits stemming from the recall. One was filed by a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 crash involving a recalled 2006 Chevy Cobalt, the other by customers who claim the ignition problems caused their cars to lose value. ####  ##### Delphi's legal exposure may hinge on how much control it had over decisions involving the design of the switch and the terms of its four-year bankruptcy, which ended in 2009. ####  ##### While Delphi made the part, GM set the specifications and ultimately approved its use, according to documents from civil litigation and congressional investigations. ####  ##### Delphi spokeswoman Claudia Tapia declined to comment, except to say that the company was ""working cooperatively with GM on this matter."" The company has not yet filed responses to the two lawsuits. GM spokesman Jim Cain said that Delphi owned the intellectual property for the switch but declined to comment on questions of liability or lawsuits. ####  ##### The February and March recalls center on concerns that ignition switches supplied by Delphi could unexpectedly turn off engines during operation and leave airbags, power steering and power brakes inoperable. ####  ##### GM has linked the defect to 13 deaths and has apologized for how it handled the recall and said it is committed to helping affected customers. ####  ##### Even though there's no doubt that Delphi made the ignition switch, the company would likely benefit from defenses that are not available to GM, which itself faces a spate of lawsuits over the recall. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Like GM, Delphi went through bankruptcy and emerged in 2009 as a different legal entity. In purchasing ""old"" Delphi's assets, the new company largely shed liability for past actions. The terms of Delphi's bankruptcy asset sale preclude ""successor liability,"" meaning that the new entity would generally not assume liabilities created by its predecessor. ####  ##### GM went through a similar process and also has a so-called shield from certain kinds of liabilities. But Delphi's shield is stronger. ####  ##### GM agreed to modify the terms of its bankruptcy exit to allow ""new"" GM to assume liability for post-bankruptcy accidents involving pre-bankruptcy products. ####  ##### Delphi, which emerged from a four-year trip through bankruptcy just months later, did not. ####  ##### For Delphi, ""there's that potential that there's just no responsibility at all"" said Larry Coben, a plaintiffs' attorney with the firm Anapol Schwartz, who represented GM product liability claimants during its bankruptcy. ####  ##### To penetrate this shield, plaintiffs' lawyers could mount a two-pronged argument. First, they would have to convince a judge that Delphi was engaged in an ongoing cover-up of the defects, and second, that because of this cover-up, the court should invoke ""successor liability"" and allow the suits to proceed against ""new"" Delphi. ####  ##### If plaintiffs can get past the bankruptcy issue, Delphi may also be able to invoke what is known as the ""component parts doctrine"" and argue that it doesn't bear the same responsibility as GM, since it only supplied the part and was not responsible for the overall vehicle. ####  ##### But if Delphi is found to have played a meaningful role in the design decisions, ""then they're liable,"" said Mark Geistfeld, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in civil litigation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Delphi began as a GM subsidiary and was spun off into an independent company in 1999. GM is Delphi's largest customer, accounting for approximately 17% of its net sales, according to Delphi's latest annual report. ####  ##### Delphi told congressional investigators that GM approved the original part in 2002, despite the fact that it did not meet GM's own specifications, according to a memo released by the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee. ####  ##### During a hearing on the recall on Tuesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said that both GM and Delphi engineers worked on the switch. ####  ##### The two companies, Rep. Blackburn said, ""have a shared responsibility and liability in this entire issue."" ####  ##### But that's easier said than proved in court. ####  ##### ""Ultimately, it would be up to a jury,"" said Lance Cooper, a plaintiffs' attorney from Georgia who is involved in litigation against GM. ""If Delphi makes the switch and they know it's a bad switch, they could point the finger at GM, but that's not going to keep them out of a courtroom."" #### "

"GM exploring compensation program for ignition-switch victims: Lawyer","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — A lawyer for General Motors Co. said for the first time Wednesday that the company is moving to develop a program that could compensate individuals affected by a faulty ignition switch in millions of recalled vehicles. ####  ##### The lawyer, Kenneth Feinberg, said in an interview on CNBC that, based on his initial conversations with GM, “they are asking for me to help develop some sort of program that might be used to compensate eligible claimants.” ####  ##### GM CEO Mary Barra said in testimony before Congress on April 1 that the company had hired Feinberg to help explore its options following the recall. GM since then has declined to say whether it would be creating some kind of victims compensation fund, which some members of Congress and consumers have been pushing for. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg said on Wednesday, “Now who's eligible; whether there will be a fund; how much money; what is the definition of how you are going to calculate the damages, or what proof will be required all remain to be seen.” ####  ##### Since February, the company has recalled 2.6 million vehicles and faced an increasing number of lawsuits on behalf of individuals injured or killed in crashes, as well as customers who say their cars lost value as a result of the recall. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In a related development on Wednesday, GM said it would ask a federal court to bar lawsuits related to actions before its 2009 bankruptcy, signaling a tougher stance toward legal claims stemming from the recall. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg told CNBC it could be several weeks before the actual structure of any program is clear, according to a transcript. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg is well known for his work in administering compensation funds for victims of high-profile disasters, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the BP P.L.C. oil spill in 2010. ####  ##### GM declined to comment directly on Mr. Feinberg's remarks. A company spokesman, Greg Martin, said in an email that the company recognized that it has “civic and legal obligations in regard to this matter,” and had tapped Mr. Feinberg to help them explore them. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Judge accepts SAC guilty plea, approves $1.2B settlement","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — SAC Capital Advisors L.P.'s $1.2 billion criminal settlement for insider trading received final court approval on Thursday, as a U.S. judge accepted a guilty plea from the hedge fund firm run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen. ####  ##### At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain accepted SAC Capital's guilty plea to fraud charges and payment of a $900 million fine. ####  ##### In total, SAC Capital has agreed to pay $1.8 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes into insider trading. The U.S. Department of Justice said that payout is the largest insider trading settlement in history. ####  ##### ""These crimes clearly were motivated by greed, and these breaches of the public trust require serious penalties,"" Judge Swain said. ####  ##### SAC Capital also agreed to be placed on probation for five years, and employ a compliance consultant, former federal prosecutor Bart Schwartz. ####  ##### The sentencing marks the end of an era for SAC Capital, which by last year had managed $15 billion of assets. ####  ##### An indictment in July alleged systemic insider trading took place at SAC Capital involving the stocks of more than 20 publicly traded companies from 1999 through 2010. ####  ##### Eight employees have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. SAC Capital agreed in November to plead guilty to four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. ####  ##### ""Today marks the day of reckoning for a fund that was riddled with criminal conduct,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The $900 million fine comes on top of a $900 million judgment approved in November by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in a related civil forfeiture case. ####  ##### That judgment gave SAC Capital credit for $616 million in earlier insider trading settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting in SAC Capital paying an additional $1.2 billion as part of the criminal accord. ####  ##### The Stamford, Conn.-based firm renamed itself Point72 Asset Management on Monday and is becoming a family office that will primarily manage Mr. Cohen's personal fortune, most recently estimated by Forbes magazine at $11.1 billion. ####  ##### Three of the four SAC Capital entities that pleaded guilty no longer manage investments, while the fourth may need 1½ years to shed a ""limited number of hard-to-liquidate assets,"" Martin Klotz, a lawyer for SAC Capital, said Thursday. ####  ##### As of Feb. 1, the firm oversaw $11.9 billion. Mr. Cohen started SAC Capital with $25 million in 1992. ####  ##### The settlement came amid a crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street by Mr. Bharara's office that has resulted in 80 individuals being convicted at trial or pleading guilty since October 2009. ####  ##### They include Michael Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, two SAC Capital portfolio managers who were found guilty in separate criminal trials in December and February. Both deny wrongdoing and are expected to appeal. ####  ##### Mr. Cohen, 57, has not been criminally charged. But in July, the SEC launched an administrative action to bar him from the securities industry for failing to supervise Messrs. Martoma and Steinberg and prevent insider trading. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Cohen has denied the SEC allegations, but has been in contact with the regulator regarding a possible settlement, a person familiar with the matter has said. ####  ##### Among the sticking points are whether the SEC should impose a lifetime industry ban on Mr. Cohen, or prevent employees from managing outside money, another person familiar with the case said. ####  ##### Mr. Cohen did not appear at Thursday's hearing, and his firm was represented by Peter Nussbaum, SAC Capital's general counsel. ####  ##### ""We accept responsibility for the misconduct of our employees brought before your honor,"" Mr. Nussbaum said. ####  ##### Mr. Swain had also been expected Thursday to weigh a request for more than $1.5 million in restitution from SAC Capital by Elan Corp., a company at the heart of Mr. Martoma's case and now owned by Perrigo Co. ####  ##### SAC Capital had objected to the request but settled with Elan before the hearing, said Terence Healy, a lawyer for Elan. ####  ##### Asked by Judge Swain during the hearing questioned the scope of Mr. Schwartz's consultant role, Antonia Apps, an assistant U.S. attorney, said he would have a ""broad mandate"" to evaluate and review SAC's compliance procedures and identify deficiencies. ####  ##### ""While they may have had compliance policies on paper, they were clearly deficient in deferring insider trading,"" Ms. Apps said. ####  ##### The case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors L.P., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-cr-00541. #### "
"NY restaurant owner must pay lesbian chef $1.6M for sex-bias, firing","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### The owner of a Mexican restaurant in New York City, who held prayer meetings in which he said gay people were “going to hell,” must pay a jury award of $1.6 million in damages to a lesbian chef who had filed a sexual orientation discrimination law suit against him, says a New York appeals court, in upholding a jury award. ####  ##### A New York Supreme Court jury had awarded chef Mirella Salemi a $1.6 million award, including $400,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress and $1.2 million in punitive damages, in December, 2012, according to the ruling by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. The appeals court's ruling in Mirella Salemi v. Gloria's Tribeca Inc. was issued March 20 but only publicized last week. ####  ##### Evidence “amply supports” the jury's verdict that, in violation of the New York City Human Rights law, Gloria's Tribeca's owner, Edward Globokar, discriminated against Ms. Salemi by, among other things, holding weekly prayer meetings during which it was repeatedly stated that homosexuality is a sin and that gay people “were going to hell “and “generally subjecting her to an incessant barrage of offensive anti-homosexual invective.” ####  ##### The unanimous 5-0 ruling said also that Ms. Salemi was retaliated against for objecting to Mr. Globokar's improper conduct, for choosing not to attend the workplace prayer meetings, and for refusing to fire another employee because of his sexual orientation, and that she was improperly discharged. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The appeals court said the trial court had protected Mr. Globokar's First Amendment rights by instructing the jury that he had a right to express his religious beliefs and practices, provided he did not discriminate against his employees based on religion or sexual orientation. ####  ##### The appeals court said the compensatory damages award does not “materially deviate” from awards in similar case and that the punitive damages awards was not “grossly excessive” given “the extensive evidence of defendant's discriminatory conduct.” #### "

"Ford worker's disability bias, retaliation case over telecommuting reinstated","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### An appeals court has reinstated a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed on behalf of a disabled Ford Motor Co. worker who was denied a telecommuting arrangement and terminated. ####  ##### Jane Harris was hired as a resale buyer in 2003 at Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford, where her job involved acting as an intermediary between steel suppliers and stampers, the companies that use steel to produce parts for Ford, according to Tuesday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ford Motor Co. ####  ##### Ms. Harris suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, an illness that causes fecal incontinence, and her symptoms worsened over time. She began to take intermittent time off under the Family Medical Leave Act when she experienced severe symptoms, according to the appeals court ruling. ####  ##### In 2005, her supervisor allowed her to work on a flex-time telecommuting schedule on a trial basis but decided it was unsuccessful because Ms. Harris could not establish regular and consistent hours, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Harris formally requested permission to telecommute on an as-needed basis as an accommodation for her disability in 2009, but her supervisors concluded her position was not suitable for telecommuting. ####  ##### In April 2009, Ms. Harris filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC. She was terminated later that year. ####  ##### In 2011, the EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court in Ann Arbor, Mich., charging that Ford violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to accommodate Ms. Harris' disability and by retaliating against her for filing a charge with the EEOC. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The federal court granted summary judgment dismissing the case, ruling in part that Ms. Harris did not qualify for her failure-to-accommodate claim because of her excessive absenteeism. ####  ##### The three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit reinstated the case in a 2-1 ruling. ####  ##### “Harris is indisputably disabled under the ADA,” according to the ruling. Ford has the burden of proving her physical presence in the workplace is an “essential function of her position” but “cannot indisputably carry its burden,” states the ruling. ####  ##### “Advancing technology has diminished the necessity of in-person contact to facilitate group conversations,” states the ruling. “Although Ford has provided significant evidence that physical attendance was an essential function of the resale buyer position, the EEOC has offered at least enough evidence genuinely to dispute this conclusion,” the ruling states. ####  ##### The majority ruling held also that “Ford has not met its burden of proving that a telecommuting accommodation, even if reasonable, would create an undue hardship.” ####  ##### It also overturned dismissal of the retaliation claim. “Viewed in a light most favorable to Harris,” the evidence presented “creates a genuine dispute as to whether Ford was truly motivated by retaliatory intent or by a reasonable business decision to terminate an underperforming employee,” says the ruling. ####  ##### “The EEOC has presented evidence on which a reasonable jury could conclude that Ford retaliated against Harris for filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC,” said the court, in remanding the case for further proceedings. ####  ##### The dissenting opinion states the EEOC has failed to prove that Ford's proffered reason for its action was a pretext for discrimination. #### "

The lawsuit accused Mr. Schane of violating federal telephone consumer law and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. ####  ##### According to court documents, State Farm denied Mr. Schane's initial claim for reimbursement of his defense costs, citing the federal law and related-statutes exclusion in its business liability policy. ####  ##### A month after his claim was denied, Mr. Schane settled the initial lawsuit with G.M. Sign and the other plaintiff companies for $4.9 million, which the plaintiff companies agreed to collect from Mr. Schane's insurer. ####  ##### However, State Farm refused to pay the settlement, arguing that the same exclusion that barred Mr. Schane from defense cost coverage in the underlying lawsuit also applied to any settlement payments on his behalf resulting from the litigation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The appellate court panel ultimately concurred with State Farm's argument in its May 2 ruling, which overturned a February 2013 decision by a Lake County Circuit Court judge. ####  ##### “Fundamentally, the court agreed that the policy exclusion for claims arising directly or indirectly out of actions which violate the TCPA extended to alternative theories premised on the same facts,” Michael Borders, a Chicago-based managing member at Dykema Gossett P.L.L.C. and one of State Farm's lead attorneys in the case, said Wednesday in a statement. ####  ##### Mr. Borders said the appellate court's ruling is the first opinion published in Illinois — and among the first nationwide — to interpret the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and related statutes exclusion that State Farm and other insurers began adding to their standardized business liability insurance policies in 2006. ####  ##### “We are very pleased with this outcome and believe that this decision may have nationwide ramifications for the insurance industry and for similarly styled TCPA class action cases moving forward,” Mr. Borders said in the statement. #### "

"Generic drug manufacturers can't be sued in Fosamax case: Court","Risk Management",""," ##### Plaintiffs who took the generic version of the osteoporosis drug Fosamax are pre-empted by federal law from pursuing litigation against its manufacturers, says an appellate court, in upholding a lower court ruling. ####  ##### Generic drugs by law must mimic brand name drugs and prior rulings have found that generic manufacturers should not be held liable for brand name defects, according to Tuesday's ruling by the 3rd U.S. District Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in In re: Fosamax (alendronate sodium) products liability litigation. ####  ##### In February, 2011, 91 plaintiffs who had used both Fosamax, which is produced by White House Station, New Jersey-based Merck & Co. Inc., and its generic versions filed a products liability suit in Missouri state court against both Merck and generic manufacturers for damages related to bone fractures they suffered after taking prescribed versions of either Fosamax or its generic version, alendronate sodium. Fosamax is a drug used to treat or prevent osteoporosis and other bone diseases. The litigation was later centralized in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J. ####  ##### In a series of orders, the federal district court dismissed all the generic defendants from the case, ruling the plaintiffs' claims were pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their design defect claims. A three-judge panel of the appeals court unanimously upheld the lower court. ####  ##### In its opinion, the panel pointed to two Supreme Court rulings: In Pliva Inc. v. Mensing, the high court held in March, 2013 that litigation against generic drug manufacturers could not go forward because it is impossible for them to comply simultaneously with the state duty to adequately warn and “their federal duty of sameness,” the federal law that requires generic drug labels to be the same as their branded counterpart.” ####  ##### And in June, 2013, in Bartlett v. Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., the high court held that state law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are pre-empted by the Pliva ruling. ####  ##### The prior rulings, “recognize that manufacturers have no control over the design or labeling of generic drugs,” said the appeals court ruling.” The plaintiffs “have failed to identify anything the generic defendants can do to reconcile their conflicting duties under state and federal law,” said the court, in affirming the lower court ruling dismissing generic manufacturers from the case. #### "

Safe Harbor framework. ####  ##### The Safe Harbor was developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission to reconcile the European Union's standard for privacy protection, which is based on comprehensive legislation, with the different approach taken by the United States, which relies on a mix of legislation, regulation and self-regulation, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

"EEOC reaches $2.4M settlement in Thai farm worker mistreatment suit ","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reached a $2.4 million settlement on part of litigation filed three years ago in which a farm labor contractor and six farms were charged with national origin discrimination and retaliation in connection with their alleged mistreatment of Thai farm workers. ####  ##### The settlement, announced Monday by the EEOC, involves four of the farms named as defendants and includes monetary relief, options for jobs and benefits, housing, other reimbursements of expenses, and sweeping injunctive relief remedies benefiting about 500 Thai workers in the EEOC's case, the agency said. ####  ##### Defendants named in the settlement were Captain Cook, Hawaii-based Mac Farms of Hawaii L.L.C.; Kalaheo, Hawaii-based Kauai Coffee Co. Inc.; Kunai, Hawaii-based Kelena Farms Inc.; and Burlingame, California-based Captain Cook Coffee Co. Ltd. ####  ##### The EEOC initially filed its lawsuit against Los Angeles, California-based farm labor contractor Global Horizons Inc. and the farms in U.S. District Court in Honolulu in April 2011, in which it charged the defendants with trafficking Thai workers to farms in Hawaii and Washington State, where they were allegedly subjected to mistreatment and discrimination. ####  ##### The EEOC said in its statement that the Thai farm workers were contracted through Global Horizons to work at the farms sometime between 2003 and 2007 under the H2-A temporary visa program, which required the farm workers to be provided food and housing along with pay for work performed. ####  ##### The EEOC said exorbitant recruitment fees placed the Thai workers in a situation of “debt bondage” early on, and workers were then subjected to varying degrees of the denial or delay of pay; monitoring movements and confiscating passports; production quotas that non-Thai workers did not have to adhere to; denial of adequate food and water, and unsanitary, overcrowded living conditions. ####  ##### The EEOC said those who complained were retaliated against, with many forced to quit or flee as a result. ####  ##### Coral Gables, Florida-based Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc., originally named one of the defendants, agreed to pay $1.2 million in November 2013 to settle the  suit against its Hawaii subsidiary. ####  ##### In March of this year, a federal judge found Global Horizons liable for harassment, discrimination and retaliation for its treatment of the workers, and set Nov. 18 for a trial to determine the amount of money it will pay for the abuses Thai workers suffered, as well as the measures Global will need to implement to prevent future abuses. ####  ##### Global Horizons and Kahului, Hawaii-based Maui Pineapple Co., whose operations were reportedly shut down in 2009, remain as the only defendants in the case, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement, Mac Farms will pay $1.6 million, Kauai Coffee will pay $425,000, Kelena Farms will pay $275,000 and Captain Cook Coffee will pay $100,000 directly to the workers, for a total of $2.4 million. ####  ##### Among other terms of the settlement, Kelena Farms offered full-time jobs with benefits, profit-sharing and 401(k) plan options, while Captain Cook offered seasonal jobs, benefits, transportation and housing for workers during the three-year terms of their decrees. The offers extended by Kelena and Captain Cook are valued at close to another $4.9 million, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “Today's announcement serves as a reminder to the agricultural industry to remain ever-vigilant in hiring and monitoring farm labor contractors,” said Anna Y. Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles district, in a statement. ####  ##### “We all have a responsibility to ensure that the most vulnerable workers are not denied basic human dignity and life-sustaining water and food. Farms and farm labor contractors — and the supervisors that represent them — must ensure workers' civil rights remain intact, no matter their race or the country they come from.” ####  ##### Attorneys for the farms either had no comment or could not be reached. #### "

"U.S. safety regulators probe Chrysler airbag recall","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — U.S. safety regulators are investigating Chrysler Group L.L.C.'s 2012 recall of 744,822 sport utility vehicles in the United States after six consumers complained of inadvertent airbag deployments even after fixes were made. ####  ##### The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents filed on Monday that it had opened a query into the recall of Jeep Liberty SUVs from model years 2002 and 2003, and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs from model years 2002 through 2004. The safety agency will study the effectiveness of the previous recall. ####  ##### Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., said in a statement that it had notified NHTSA of the six incidents involving inadvertent airbag deployments while the vehicles were in operation and was cooperating with the safety agency's investigation. ####  ##### Chrysler recalled the vehicles on Nov. 7, 2012, because airbag circuits could degrade. The company addressed the problem by installing an in-line jumper harness with an integrated electrical filter to eliminate electrical spikes that the company believed were causing the problem, according to the NHTSA documents. The safety agency had previously opened an investigation of the issue in October 2011 and three months later upgraded the probe. ####  ##### In the latest six cases in the NHTSA documents, no crashes were reported, but injuries consisting of cuts and burns were alleged. ####  ##### At the time of the recall in 2012, another 174,723 SUVs were affected in Canada, Mexico and outside of North America. The probe found 215 cases of inadvertent airbag deployments that resulted in 81 minor injuries in the United States but no crashes. #### "
"Watchdog urges E.U. leaders to shield citizens from snooping","Risk Management","European Union, Germany"," ##### (Reuters) — European Union countries need stricter controls to protect citizens from spying, a top data protection official said on Thursday, a warning that may rekindle a debate about snooping before an E.U. summit next week. ####  ##### Revelations by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden about mass surveillance of global Internet traffic and phone records have prompted calls in Europe for tighter safeguards and a review of data-sharing agreements with the United States, but so far with few concrete results. ####  ##### In a letter to European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, data protection official Peter Hustinx expressed concern that EU heads of state might fail to make a strong enough commitment to protect their citizens. ####  ##### “The allegations of mass surveillance by security services have rocked the trust in the ability and willingness of governments and businesses to protect individuals' personal information,” Mr. Hustinx wrote, without singling out the United States or mentioning Snowden specifically. ####  ##### “The importance of data protection in building the European area of freedom, security and justice cannot be overstated,” he said. ####  ##### The intervention of the official responsible for the protection of E.U. staff's personal data comes shortly after Germany's public prosecutor launched an investigation into the alleged bugging of Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone by U.S. intelligence. ####  ##### Data protection will be one of the items on the agenda when Ms. Merkel and other leaders meet for two days of talks on June 26. ####  ##### A draft statement to be issued at the summit, seen by Reuters, said it would be “crucial to ensure the protection of fundamental rights, including data protection, while addressing security concerns.” ####  ##### But the intervention from Mr. Hustinx, who also sits on a group of European privacy watchdogs, implied that this did not go far enough and underscores a growing sense of alarm among some officials that Europe's response to U.S. spying has been limp. ####  ##### Last year, the European Union backed down on threats to suspend an agreement allowing U.S. companies to gather customer information in Europe and send it to the United States, outside the E.U.'s legal jurisdiction. ####  ##### On Wednesday Ireland's High Court asked Europe's top court to review the agreement in light of allegations that the U.S. National Security Agency used companies such as Facebook and Apple to gather data on Europeans. ####  ##### The E.U. is set to discuss the data-transfer agreement, known as Safe Harbor, with the United States on Wednesday. ####  ##### The snooping dispute could also complicate attempts by Brussels and Washington to reach a free-trade pact encompassing almost half of the world's economy. #### "

"Fired worker ordered reinstated after NLRB finds no-gossip rule 'overly broad'","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A Georgia technical college unlawfully terminated an employee on the basis of its “overly broad” no-gossip policy, says the National Labor Relations Board, which has ordered the worker's reinstatement and the policy's withdrawal. ####  ##### Joslyn Henderson worked as an admissions representative for Decatur, Georgia based Laurus Technical Institute, a private, for-profit technical school, according to a Dec. 11, 2013 ruling by an administrative law judge in Laurus Technical College and Joslyn Henderson, which was affirmed by three members of the NLRB board on Friday. ####  ##### In 2011, Ms. Henderson filed a charge against the school with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging sexual harassment and retaliation by one of the school managers. ####  ##### She was subsequently chastised by the school's CEO for discussing her work issues and complaints with a manager who was not in her chain of command. ####  ##### Nine days later, on Feb. 22, 2011, the school issued a “no gossip policy” that said in part, “Employees that participate in or instigate gossip about the company, an employee, or customer will receive disciplinary actions.” ####  ##### Ms. Henderson was subsequently promoted to senior admissions representative. On Oct. 29, 2011, however, while she was out on unpaid medical leave, another worker reported she had talked negatively about the company and some of its workers, and had become “verbally aggressive.” Ms. Henderson was suspended on Oct. 29 and terminated on Nov. 12 for “willful breach of company polices and counterproductive behavior.” ####  ##### Laurus' no-gossip rule “on its face prohibits protected activity,” said the administrative law judge's ruling. Its language is “overly broad, ambiguous and severely restricts employees from discussing or complaining about terms and conditions of employment,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “A thorough reading of this vague, overly broad policy reveals that it narrowly prohibits virtually all communications about anyone, including the company or its managers. ####  ##### “In fact, read literally, this rule would preclude both negative and positive comments about a person's personal or professional life unless that person and/or his/her supervisor are present.” Such a policy on its face violates the National Labor Relations Act, says the ruling. ####  ##### In its ruling Friday, the NLRB ordered Laurus to rescind its policy, offer Ms. Henderson reinstatement to her former job or an equivalent position, and reimburse her for any loss of earnings or other benefits she had suffered. #### "

POM had filed a lawsuit against Coca-Cola saying that it had misled customers by selling a pomegranate blueberry juice even though it had 0.5% of the two juices. ####  ##### Both a U.S. District Court in California and a federal appeals court said that POM could not bring its claims under the federal Lanham Act, but the Supreme Court reversed that finding. ####  ##### Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote on behalf of a unanimous court that challenges such as POM's are permitted even though food and beverage labels are regulated under another federal law, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. ####  ##### The lower courts had said it was the prerogative of the Food and Drug Administration, and not private parties, to object to juice labels which are potentially misleading. ####  ##### Justice Kennedy wrote that, contrary to what Coca-Cola argued, the two laws complement each other. He noted, for example, that the FDA ""does not have the same perspective or expertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day competitors possess."" ####  ##### POM, which makes a product that is 100% pomegranate juice, had filed the lawsuit saying that the Minute Maid juice label was misleading and would hurt sales for its own product. ####  ##### The Minute Maid juice is sold as a ""Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices."" It is mostly apple and grape juice with just 0.3% pomegranate juice and 0.2% blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing. ####  ##### Pomegranate and blueberries are popular with health-conscious Americans because they contain antioxidants that some believe prevent cancer and heart disease, although the science behind that belief is unclear. ####  ##### Justices do not usually reveal why they recuse themselves in cases so it not known why Justice Breyer did not participate.

The agency said he would also stare at, and comment on, the breasts and bodies of SunTrust’s female clients who came into the branch. ####  ##### The EEOC said numerous complaints by female employees to the assistant branch manager and other SunTrust branch managers were ignored, and that SunTrust failed to take sufficient action to stop the harassment once its human resources department got involved. ####  ##### The EEOC said during the course of its investigation into the discrimination charges, the branch manager voluntarily resigned but was subsequently rehired by the bank. ####  ##### The company was charged with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as Florida state laws. Under terms of the settlement, in addition to paying the $300,000, the bank has agreed to conduct annual live training for its managers and human resources personnel, among other provisions. ####  ##### “It is critical for employers to take prompt action once an employee reports sexual harassment,” Tampa, Florida-based EEOC director Georgia Marchbanks said in a statement. “The women in this case expected to work in a professional environment and should not have been subjected to ongoing harassment by their supervisor.” ####  ##### The bank said in a statement, “SunTrust has a strong commitment to a harassment-free work environment.

"HP wins dismissal of lawsuit linked to ex-CEO Hurd's ouster","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### (Reuters) — Hewlett-Packard Co. has won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the computer maker of securities fraud for misleading shareholders about its commitment to ethics while its chief executive was allegedly engaging in sexual harassment. ####  ##### In August 2013, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco had thrown out an earlier version of the lawsuit, and on Wednesday dismissed a revised version that he said failed to address his concerns. Wednesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the lawsuit cannot be brought again. ####  ##### Before the case arose, HP had updated its Standards of Business Conduct following a 2006 scandal over news leaks. ####  ##### The lawsuit stemmed from the sudden August 2010 departure of Chief Executive Mark Hurd amid allegations that he had harassed an independent consultant, Jodie Fisher. Mr. Hurd, who is now president of Oracle Corp., had won wide credit at HP for improving the company's fortunes. ####  ##### An internal HP probe ultimately cleared Mr. Hurd of harassment but found that he filed inaccurate expense reports. Plaintiffs led by the Retail Wholesale & Department Store Union Local 338 Retirement Fund of Mineola, New York, claimed that HP's share price was inflated during the period of Mr. Hurd's alleged misconduct. ####  ##### They said the Palo Alto, California-based company's statements about its business conduct standards led them to believe Mr. Hurd was in compliance. ####  ##### Last August, Judge Tigar called HP's statements too vague and general to justify liability, but gave the plaintiffs another chance to make their case. ####  ##### On Wednesday, he said the new complaint offered more detail about Mr. Hurd's conduct and whether it violated HP's rules, but still did not show that Mr. Hurd's or HP's representations amounted to a ""warranty of ethical compliance"" with the SBC. ####  ##### ""Accordingly,"" Judge Tigar wrote, ""plaintiff has not stated a securities law violation."" He also said Mr. Hurd's failure to disclose his non-compliance with the SBC was not a ""materially false"" omission. ####  ##### Ira Press, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. HP did not immediately respond to similar requests. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment. ####  ##### The case is Retail Wholesale & Department Store Union Local 338 Retirement Fund v.

"Walgreen to pay fired diabetic employee who took bag of chips $180,000","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Walgreen Co. has agreed to pay $180,000 to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with firing an 18-year employee with diabetes after she allegedly ate a bag of chips without paying for it to stave off a low blood sugar attack. ####  ##### Josefina Hernandez developed diabetes about five years after she started working as a cashier at a South San Francisco, California store operated by Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen, according to court papers. ####  ##### Walgreen, which knew about her condition, had allowed Ms. Hernandez to possess candy in case of low blood sugar, keep her insulin in the break room refrigerator and take additional breaks to test her blood sugar or eat because of her diabetes, according to court papers. ####  ##### On Sept., 18, 2008, she suffered a hypoglycemic attack while restocking items and grabbed a $1.39 bag of potato chips from the store to stabilize her condition. She claimed she went to pay for it, but finding no one at the cosmetics counter where she had been instructed to pay for store items, she put the remaining potato chips under the counter at her cash register and returned to restocking items. She was terminated on Oct. 8, 2008, for violating the chain's “anti-grazing” policy. ####  ##### The EEOC field suit against the chain in September 2011, charging it with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Walgreen filed a motion seeking summary judgment dismissing the case. The U.S. District Court in San Francisco denied the motion in an April 11, 2014, ruling. ####  ##### Judge William H. Orrick held in that ruling that it was up to a jury to decide whether Ms. Hernandez's disability was the cause of her misconduct, and whether Walgreen should have been required to accommodate her theft as a reasonable accommodation. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement approved by Judge Orrick, in addition to paying Ms. Hernandez the $180,000, the company will post a revised policy regarding accommodation of disabled employees on its employee intranet site and provide anti-discrimination training, among other provisions, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### EEOC San Francisco regional attorney William R. Tamayo said in a statement that not only was Ms. Hernandez's termination “harsh and unfair, but it was illegal, and that's why the EEOC sued to correct this wrong. People may think this case revolves around theft, but the real issue is how a company responded to a valued 18-year employee, whom it knew for 13 years to be diabetic, and who attempted to pay for the chips after she recovered from her hypoglycemic attack.” ####  ##### A Walgreen spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. #### "
"Insurers sue asbestos trust for records, say they suspect fraud","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers"," ##### (Reuters) — Six insurance companies are suing an asbestos personal injury trust set up by a U.S. unit of Philips Electronics North America Corp. that the insurers suspect has been making millions of dollars in fraudulent payments to parties that cannot prove they were harmed by the company's asbestos products. ####  ##### In the lawsuit, the insurers — AIU Insurance Co., American Home Assurance Co., Birmingham Fire Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, Granite State Insurance Co., Lexington Insurance Co. and National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. — are seeking access to trust records. ####  ##### The insurers said the asbestos personal injury, or PI, trust set up during the 2008 bankruptcy of T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition L.L.C., a unit of Philips, had been paying substantially more claims than originally forecast. ####  ##### ""Plaintiffs have a reasonable suspicion that fraudulent claims have been submitted to and paid by the asbestos PI trust,"" said the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in Delaware's Court of Chancery. ####  ##### The lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal and legislative actions aimed at shedding light on the trusts, which have been used for decades to compensate people injured by exposure to cancer-causing asbestos. ####  ##### Dozens of companies have filed for bankruptcy in the wake of thousands of lawsuits and then set up trusts that collectively control tens of billions of dollars. ####  ##### The six insurers were seeking to conduct an audit of trust records as part of a bankruptcy agreement with T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition, or THAN, Philips Electronics North America and the asbestos trust. ####  ##### An attorney who represented THAN as well as the asbestos trust said the lawsuit had no merit because the insurers were offered the opportunity to audit the trust's claims in compliance with the bankruptcy plan. ####  ##### ""They want to conduct a different audit than the one contemplated by the agreement,"" said Sander Esserman of Stutzman, Bromberg, Esserman & Plifka P.C. in Dallas. ""I suspect the lawsuit will not receive any traction in the courts."" ####  ##### Philips Electronics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### THAN filed for bankruptcy in 2008 in the wake of thousands of lawsuits by people alleging they were made sick by the asbestos the company distributed until 1980. ####  ##### In exchange for setting up the $900 million trust, all future asbestos-related claims against THAN were directed to the trust. ####  ##### The six insurers agreed to make installment payments to Philips Electronics North America based on the distributions by the asbestos trust. They said in their lawsuit they may have paid $25 million more than they should have due to the suspected fraud. ####  ##### In January, a judge found in the bankruptcy of Garlock Sealing Technologies that personal injury lawyers had repeatedly sought claims from asbestos trusts after their clients told courts they had no exposure to the products the trusts were compensating for. ####  ##### Federal and state lawmakers have also proposed bills that would increase disclosure from the asbestos trusts. ####  ##### The case is AIU Insurance Co. et al. v. Philips Electronics North America Corp. et al., Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 9852. #### "
"Health system settles disability suit over leave policy for $1.35M ","Risk Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Disability"," ##### A New Jersey health care system has agreed to pay $1.35 million to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for its fixed leave policy. ####  ##### However, Plainsboro, New Jersey-based Princeton HealthCare System, which operates an inpatient hospital and several outpatient medical facilities, said in a statement it had revised its policy in 2010. ####  ##### The EEOC said Monday that Princeton's fixed leave policy failed to consider leave as a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### The agency said Princeton's leave policy merely tracked the requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act, and that employee leaves were limited to a maximum of 12 weeks. This meant employees who were not eligible for FMLA leave were fired after being absent for a short time, and many more were fired once they were out for more than 12 weeks, said the EEOC. ####  ##### Under the consent decree settling the suit, in addition to paying the $1.35 million, Princeton is prohibited from having a blanket policy that limits the amount of leave time an employee covered by the ADA may take, among other provisions, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “This is the latest in a series of cases challenging unlawful leave policies, and the relief obtained here furthers the EEOC's efforts to reinvigorate the Americans with Disabilities Act following the 2008 amendments,” said EEOC general counsel David Lopez in a statement. “While the EEOC is always careful and cautious before resorting to litigation, our efforts here should encourage employers to voluntarily comply with the ADA.” ####  ##### Princeton said in a statement: “The case involved a human resource policy that was in place a number of years ago and was changed in 2010. As part of this settlement, the EEOC has reviewed the hospital's current policies and our ongoing program for training employees and supervisors, and has stated that it has no objection to the hospital's current policies and training program. ####  ##### “In this lawsuit, the EEOC claimed that 23 employees were negatively impacted by the previous policy. Although the hospital disagrees that the prior policy violated the ADA and challenged the claims, the hospital has agreed to resolve those matters in order to avoid the very high cost and disruption of operations caused by the ongoing litigation. The hospital has always been and remains fully committed to a workplace free of any discrimination.” ####  ##### A recent federal appeals court ruling that  allows employers to set rigid disability leave guidelines is the first to bump up directly against the EEOC's policy of promoting more flexible policies for injured or ill workers. #### "

The previous recall affected the same three models from the 2010 model year. ####  ##### Chrysler said in a statement that the expanded recall is being done “out of an abundance of caution” and includes an additional 695,957 vehicles, in addition to the previous recall of 196,000 vehicles, in North America. ####  ##### Officials with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also want more information from Chrysler about the inadvertent cutting off of engines and air bags because of potentially faulty ignition switches on 2006-2007 Jeep Commander and 2005-2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs. The NHTSA is also investigating the Jeep models. ####  ##### General Motors Co announced the recall on Monday of 8.23 million mostly older models, including the Chevrolet Impala, because of ignition switch defects. Three deaths are linked to the latest GM recall. ####  ##### So far this year, GM has recalled about 29 million vehicles worldwide, about half of them for ignition switch issues. ####  ##### As for the Journey and minivans recall, the NHTSA said it wants more information from Chrysler on why a remedy for potentially defective ignition switches might not solve the issue of air bags not deploying in a crash. ####  ##### Chrysler said it proposed a remedy that would make it more difficult to inadvertently bump the ignition from the “run” to “accessory” position while driving, which turns off the engine and the air bags. ####  ##### Chrysler said it is aware of two accidents and no injuries in the affected Journey, Grand Caravan and Town & Country models. #### "

"Judge wants grocery chain held in contempt for ignoring disability bias decree","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Disability"," ##### A federal magistrate judge has recommended that the Supervalu Inc. supermarket chain be held in contempt of court and sanctioned for violating a court decree entered to resolve an Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuit against the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based firm, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said. ####  ##### The recommendation by Federal Magistrate Judge Michael Mason on Tuesday to the U.S. District Court in Chicago stems from a $3.2 million settlement of charges in January 2011 that Supervalu unit Jewel-Osco terminated employees with disabilities at the end of medical leave rather than bringing them back to work with reasonable accommodations. ####  ##### The EEOC said Wednesday in a statement that Jewel-Osco has been under the terms of a three-year consent decree since the settlement. ####  ##### The magistrate judge's ruling said “the evidence is overwhelming that the company did not do what it was supposed to do under the decree.” It said Jewel-Osco was in contempt of court when it violated the provision of the consent decree enjoining the company from discriminating “on the basis of disability by not providing reasonable accommodations to persons desiring to return to work from a disability leave.” ####  ##### Judge Mason recommended that Jewel-Osco pay a total of $82,000 in back pay to three former employees who were denied accommodation. He also recommended that the court extend the consent decree by one year and order that a special master, paid by the company, review the decisions made by the company and its medical accommodations to ensure compliance with the decree. ####  ##### “Consent decrees have teeth,” John Hendrickson, regional attorney in the EEOC's Chicago district office, said in the statement. “Courts do not look kindly upon open and notorious violations of the consent decrees they enter, nor, as this decision shows, upon employers who attempt to mischaracterize the evidence which the court itself has seen introduced. Jewel-Osco ought to have known better on both counts, and we must hope that Magistrate Judge Mason's findings will sound an alarm with respect to the company's compliance with the federal employment discrimination laws, including the ADA.” ####  ##### Supervalu said in a statement that it divested itself of Jewel-Osco in March 2013 and therefore does not have any comment to offer on this decision. A Jewel-Osco spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "

"Appeals court revives BP retirement-plan lawsuit","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Retirement Benefits, Energy"," ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit in which participants in four BP p.l.c. employee retirement savings plans claimed they were deceived into buying and holding BP stock before and after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. ####  ##### The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said that a ruling last month from the U.S. Supreme Court upended the reasoning applied by a lower court that had dismissed the class action suit two years ago. ####  ##### A unanimous three-judge panel ordered U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison in Houston to take another look at the claims of participants in the retirement savings plans. ####  ##### The participants said the value of a BP stock fund in which their money was invested fell by $1.85 billion in the months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion killed 11 workers and caused the worst ever U.S. offshore oil spill. ####  ##### The participants alleged that BP misled them as investors, and as early as 2007 overstated the safety controls the company had in place. ####  ##### They also alleged that fiduciaries who were charged with managing the retirement savings plans breached their duties by failing to sell off BP stock and take other actions to protect investors. ####  ##### Judge Ellison dismissed the lawsuit in March 2012, finding that plan fiduciaries enjoyed a legal presumption that they acted prudently. ####  ##### The U.S. Supreme Court, though, did away with the presumption last month in a different case, and the appeals court said the development meant Judge Ellison should reconsider the suit. ####  ##### In May, Judge Ellison ruled in a separate shareholder suit that another set of investors who bought BP’s American depository shares soon after the explosion may pursue claims as a group. ####  ##### “The Fifth Circuit today remanded the ERISA case to the district court in light of new pleading standards set forth by the Supreme Court,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in a statement. “BP does not believe the plaintiffs satisfy these new standards and intends to renew its motion to dismiss in the district court."" ####  ##### An attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond. #### "

It also removes the biggest obstacle to the bank's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities issued by Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender Bank of America acquired in 2008. ####  ##### AIG will file notices dismissing its litigation accusing the bank of causing billions of dollars in losses by selling it shoddy mortgage securities. The litigation is pending in New York and California. ####  ##### For the past three years, AIG led opponents in holding up court approval of a settlement Bank of America reached in June 2011 with institutional investors to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims over $174 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the housing crisis. ####  ##### The investors said Countrywide had misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis. ####  ##### Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc., Allianz S.E.'s Pimco and Metlife Inc., and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the trustee for the securities, agreed to the settlement. ####  ##### AIG claimed there was no evidence that the deal provided adequate compensation for losses. ####  ##### Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court gave the go-ahead for the bulk of the settlement in January, withholding her approval only from settlement of claims involving certain loans that had been modified. But AIG appealed Justice Kapnick's decision. ####  ##### As part of the agreement, AIG agreed to withdraw its objection.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Wal-Mart Transportation L.L.C., which was filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey, on July 10, charges that Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart was “careless and negligent in the ownership and operation” of the truck, which caused Mr. Morgan and other victims “severe personal injuries.” ####  ##### It charges also that the retailer should have known it was unreasonable for the driver, Kevin Roper, to commute more than 700 miles from his home in Jonesboro, Georgia, before starting his shift at a Wal-Mart facility in Smyrna, Delaware, “especially immediately before he was to commence a long shift operating a truck that weighed approximately 30-40 tons.” ####  ##### It states there were many Wal-Mart distribution facilities closer to Mr. Roper's home, including at least nine in Georgia alone, which would have significantly reduced his commute to work. ####  ##### It says that Mr. Roper, who began his shift at 11:22 a.m. June 6, hit the limousine carrying Mr. Morgan at 12:54 a.m. June 7 after he fell asleep at the wheel. It states also he was driving 65 mph in a 45 mph zone at the time of the accident. ####  ##### The lawsuit says also that the state-of-the art, 2011 Wal-Mart truck did not automatically brake before the accident, as it was designed to do. ####  ##### The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, among other compensation. Mr. Morgan, who was traveling from an appearance in Delaware at the time of the accident, has just been released from a rehabilitation facility, according to news reports. ####  ##### Wal-Mart said in a statement, “This has been a terrible tragedy” and that the company's thoughts continue to go out to the accident's victims and the families and friends of everyone involved, including those of James McNair, who was killed in the crash. ####  ##### The estate of Mr. McNair is not among the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit. ####  ##### “We are deeply sorry that one of our trucks was involved.

The misconduct related to Libor rates for sterling, the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. ####  ##### The penalties for Lloyds comprise a £105 million ($178.3 million) fine by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, $105 million by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and an $86 million fine by the U.S. Department of Justice. ####  ##### The FCA said there had been routine manipulation of sterling Libor submissions to benefit money market trading positions between September 2006 and June 2009. ####  ##### To avoid negative media comment and market perceptions of its financial strength, Bank of Scotland, which Lloyds later acquired, manipulated Libor submissions as a result of at least two management directives in September and October 2008, the FCA said. ####  ##### It said that in September 2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a global meltdown in markets, a manager instructed a trader to lower dollar Libor submissions. ####  ##### ""I've been pressured by senior management to bring my rates down into line with everyone else,"" a third trader said. ####  ##### Emails uncovered by the FCA showed traders seeking to peg Libor quotes to ""suit the books."" The FCA said there was a culture among traders of seeking to take a financial advantage wherever possible. ####  ##### For example, on July 19, 2007, when a Lloyds manager was informed by a Lloyds trader about a request made to another Lloyds trader for a low rate, the trader commented that ""every little helps ... It's like Tesco's,"" repeating an advertising slogan used by Britain's biggest retailer. ####  ##### The Lloyds manager replied ""Absolutely, every little helps."" ####  ##### Lloyds was rescued by a £20.5 billion ($34.80 billion) government bailout during the financial crisis after a government-engineered takeover of HBOS P.L.C. turned sour. Taxpayers still hold a 25% stake in the bank five years later. ####  ##### Lloyds' settlement follows British rivals Barclays P.L.C. and Royal Bank of Scotland P.L.C., which agreed to pay fines of $453 million and $612 million respectively in 2012 and 2013. ####  ##### The FCA said the total U.K. fine included £70 million ($118.8 million) for attempting to manipulate fees payable to the Bank of England for the firm's participation in the special liquidity scheme, a taxpayer-backed government initiative to support British banks during the financial crisis. ####  ##### The FCA fine included a 30% discount for early settlement. ####  ##### Britain's financial regulator said 16 individuals at Lloyds, seven of them managers, were directly involved in or aware of the various forms of Libor manipulation, including one manager who was also involved in the repo rate misconduct. ####  ##### ""Their behavior involved a gross breach of trust, and we condemn it without reservation,"" Lloyds Chairman Norman Blackwell said Monday. ####  ##### The Bank of England said Lloyds has paid it £7.8 million ($13.2 million) in compensation for the reduction on the amount of SLS fees it received as a result of manipulation. ####  ##### Lloyds' behavior was ""highly reprehensible and clearly unlawful,"" the BoE said in a statement. ####  ##### In a related action, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Lloyds, deferring criminal wire fraud charges in exchange for Lloyds continuing to cooperate and agreeing to an $86 million penalty. ####  ##### Shares in Lloyds barely moved on the news, which had been widely flagged, and were up 0.1% at 74.9 pence ($1.27) at 1250 GMT. #### "

"Morgan Stanley to pay $275M penalty for misleading RMBS investors","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday it had charged Morgan Stanley with misleading investors about two mortgage-backed securities it issued before the 2008 financial crisis, and that the bank would pay $275 million to settle the case, according to a press release. ####  ##### The SEC found Morgan Stanley had not given investors in the securities, which were called Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4 and Morgan Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-HE7, the correct information about how many of the mortgages they contained were delinquent, the release said. ####  ##### The market for residential mortgage-backed securities reached $2.2 trillion in 2007 but a wave of mortgage defaults made the values of many of the securities plunge in 2008, causing the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers to collapse and eventually leading to a credit and liquidity crisis on Wall Street and a deep economic recession. ####  ##### ""Morgan Stanley understated the number of delinquent loans behind these securitizations during a critical juncture of the financial crisis and denied investors the full extent of the facts necessary to make informed investment decisions,"" said Michael Osnato, the chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Complex Financial Instruments Unit, in the release. ####  ##### As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley neither admitted nor denied the charges. ####  ##### ""We're pleased to settle the matter,"" said Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley. ####  ##### The two RMBS issues in the case were the last subprime RMBS Morgan Stanley sponsored, issued and underwrote. According to the SEC, the two deals' offering documents said less than 1% of their loan pools' principal balances were delinquent at the time the securities were formed. In reality, 17% of the loans in one of the issues and 4.5% of the loans in the other were delinquent at that time. ####  ##### The SEC said Morgan Stanley had a chart showing the 17% delinquency rate for one of the two issues. And it did not tell investors it had had to delay the closing of the other one by a month, at which time it had received updated information on the number of delinquent loans showing they made up 4.5% of the total. ####  ##### The SEC said it would return the money collected in the settlement to investors who were harmed by the bank's misrepresentations. Its announcement did not include the names of the investors. #### "
"Greenbrier says rapid phase-out of older oil-by-rail tank cars doable","Risk Management","Canada, Energy"," ##### (Reuters) — A top U.S. railcar maker, The Greenbrier Companies Inc., said on Wednesday a two-year timeline to retire older railcars that carry dangerous flammable liquids, including North Dakota Bakken crude, is “aggressive” but can be done. ####  ##### Those comments came after the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed new safety standards for moving crude and ethanol by rail in light of several fiery accidents over the past year. ####  ##### The proposed standards suggest phasing out older cars built before October 2011, which is when the industry adopted a newer design with 7/16-inch thick steel hulls, reinforced valves and head shields on railcars' front, back or both to better protect against leaks in a derailment. ####  ##### “A two-year timetable for phasing out the use of older DOT-111 cars in the most hazardous flammable service is aggressive, but can be met with appropriate retrofit packages and new car design,” Greenbrier spokesman Jack Isselmann said. ####  ##### The older models, known as DOT-111s and built since the late 1950s, lack valve protection and heat shields. DOT-111s were the type of railcars in several of the past year's crashes, including a runaway train that careened into a small Quebec town and exploded, killing 47 people. ####  ##### Several U.S. refiners that receive crude by rail already use only post-October 2011 railcars as their projects started up after that. Others are phasing out older ones this year as post October 2011 models come in. ####  ##### But DOT's proposed rules suggest several options for tank cars built after October 2015, two of which call for 9/16-inch thick steel hulls. A third option would maintain the 7/16-inch standard in the post-October 2011 models. ####  ##### James Rader, senior vice president of Watco Companies L.L.C., the second-largest short-line railroad operator in the U.S. with oil-by-rail operations, said at a June conference in Houston that DOT's measures could go beyond the October 2011 industry standard with thicker hulls and other protections. ####  ##### In his presentation, Mr. Rader said about 40% of cars that carry crude now are newer ones. He projected that by the end of 2015 the fleet of newer cars would be about 55,546 — larger than today's fleet of 48,503 cars carrying crude. ####  ##### Some predicted capacity constraints but others have said the industry usually overbuilds during boom times. ####  ##### “That three-year turnaround time — two years from the October 2015 date — is going to be a bit tight based on shop capacity for tank cars,” said Jason Seidl, analyst at Cowen & Co. ####  ##### Justin Long, an analyst at Stephens Inc., a financial services firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, said at the Houston conference that railcar manufacturers have “a history of overbuilding, and we don't think this cycle will be any different.” ####  ##### While railcar makers and maintenance companies may see more business from tighter regulations, shipping and leasing companies will see rates rise, Mr. Long said. ####  ##### They might have to pay about $10,000 in disposal fees to scrap an old car, or more than $130,000 for a new one. ####  ##### Consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. said this week that retrofitting is estimated to cost $30,000 to $60,000 per tank car. ####  ##### Most companies that retrofit railcars are privately held, while Greenbrier and American Railcar Industries Inc. are public. ####  ##### Makers of new cars include Greenbrier, American Railcar, Trinity Industries Inc. and Union Tank Car, owned by Berkshire Hathaway. ####  ##### Greenbrier in February began marketing a newer tank car design with 9/16-inch thick steel, as well as stronger top and bottom outlet protection and an outer steel jacket with ceramic insulation. ####  ##### Greenbrier last month said customers had ordered 3,500 of that style of newer tank car. ####  ##### This week Greenbrier and Watco formed GBW Railcar Services, a joint venture combining their 38 railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance shops in anticipation of swifter business. #### "
"Alabama health system, doctors group settle whistleblower kickback case for $24.5M","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits"," ##### An Alabama health system and a physicians group have reached a $24.5 million settlement of a whistleblower lawsuit, in which they were charged with violating the False Claims Act by paying or receiving kickbacks in connection with claims to the Medicare program, the Department of Justice said Monday. ####  ##### The DOJ’s lawsuit charged that two clinics affiliated with Mobile, Alabama-based Infirmary Health System Inc. had agreements with Mobile, Alabama-based Diagnostic Physicians Group P.C. to pay the group a percentage of Medicare payments for tests and procedures referred by its physicians, in violation of the Physician Self-Referral Statute — or Stark Law — and the Anti-Kickback Statute. ####  ##### The Department said these laws are intended to ensure that a physician’s medical judgment is not compromised by improper financial incentives. The Anti-Kickback Statue prohibits offering paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals or items or services covered by federal healthcare programs including Medicare. The Stark Law forbids hospitals or clinics from billing Medicare for certain services referred by physicians who have financial relationship with the entity. ####  ##### Whistleblower Dr. Christian Heesch, a physician formerly employed by Diagnostic Physicians Group, who originally filed the lawsuit under the whistle-blower provisions of the False Claims Act, will receive $4.41 million as his share of the settlement, the DOJ said. ####  ##### “Today’s settlement represents a single but significant step towards achieving integrity in the administration of public health programs in this region,” said U.S. Attorney Kenyan Brown for the Southern District of Alabama, in Mobile, in a statement. “Physicians, physician groups and other medical entities operating illegally within public health programs will be held accountable. I also commend whistle blowers like Dr. Christian Heesch, who helped bring this particular case to light.” ####  ##### Infirmary Health CEO Mark Nix said in a statement, “Every day our doctors, nurses and employees work to provide the highest quality of care to the 800,000 patients we treat each year. This agreement to settle these claims represents our strong desire to move past litigation about what has been a very complex issue and allow us to end this distraction so that we can focus on our mission and purpose as a community healthcare provider. ####  ##### “Earlier this year, Infirmary Health and Infirmary Medical Clinics were dismissed from this lawsuit as well as a separate but related lawsuit filed by a former system physician. This settlement will allow us to avoid additional expenses of defense and the distractions associated with litigation. Our intent has always been to comply with the very complex and extremely technical Stark Law. This complaint resulted from what has been a disagreement with the government over our interpretation of the law as written.” ####  ##### “It is very important to note that this suit focused solely on highly complicated contracts with physicians. Our patients received all of the medical services ordered by their physicians and those services were billed at the appropriate rates. ####  ##### “Our mission statement is L.I.F.E., defined as Leadership, Integrity, Family and Excellent Service. Today, with this matter behind us, we can focus on what means the most to us: providing superior quality care for our patients.” ####  ##### Attorneys for Diagnostic Physicians Group could not be reached for comment. ####  ##### In February, long-term care pharmacy firm Omnicare, based in Cincinnati, agreed to pay the government $4.2 million to settle charges in a whistleblower suit that it engaged in a kickback scheme with a drug manufacturer in violation of the False Claims Act, the DOJ said. #### "
"Case against Boeing for firing worker with migraines can proceed","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A federal court has refused to dismiss a Family Medical Leave Act violation claim by a Boeing Co. employee who was terminated after she attempted to take FMLA leave for her migraines, stating there is evidence the company discriminated against her. ####  ##### Jill Alexander's managers knew since at least 2000 that Ms. Alexander, who worked for the Chicago-based company from 1996 to 2013, suffered from migraines and missed work because of them, according to Monday's ruling by the U.S. District Court in Seattle in Jill Alexander v. Boeing Co.. ####  ##### From about 2009 through 2013, Ms. Alexander would telecommute sporadically because of her migraines, and they became more frequent beginning in 2013, according to the ruling. Meanwhile, beginning in April or May 2012, Boeing told its employees they could no longer work from home if they were sick or work partial or flexible days. ####  ##### In June 2012, Ms. Alexander was told for the first time that she could apply for unpaid FMLA leave to cover absences caused by her migraines, and she took intermittent FMLA leave for the reminder of the year. However, because she was no longer allowed to work partial or flexible days, her absences were “far more frequent than they were before and her reviews suffered as a result,” said the ruling. She was also disciplined for what Boeing deemed to be “unexcused' absences, said the ruling. ####  ##### On May 2, 2013, Ms. Alexander's supervisor and a human resources employee received notification she had applied for FMLA leave for April 29 through May 3. Despite this notification, they decided to terminate her for “job abandonment” because she had not come to work, and fired her on May 3, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Alexander filed suit against the company in District Court in Seattle, charging violation of the FMLA as well as state law claims. There is “direct evidence that Boeing's decision to terminate the plaintiff was due to her absences from April 29 through May 2, 2013,” said the ruling by Judge Richard A. Jones. ####  ##### “However, if those absences were covered by the FMLA, Boeing's consideration of those absences as a 'negative factor' in the termination decision violated the FMLA,” the ruling said. ####  ##### The ruling also says that Boeing argued Ms. Alexander was ineligible for FMLA leave beginning Jan. 1, 2013, because she had not accrued the required 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to the request leave. ####  ##### However, while she does not dispute she worked only 1,203.2 official hours for the period, she contended she attained the required total by working at least 2.5 hours per week that were not included in her regular or overtime hours. Accordingly, said the ruling, “the court finds that genuine disputes of material fact exist” as to whether she was eligible for FMLA leave, said Judge Jones. ####  ##### Ms. Alexander “has presented sufficient evidence that creates triable issue of fact regarding whether Boeing's discipline and termination for plaintiff's absenteeism (conduct resulting from her migraines) demonstrates discriminatory motive,” said the court, in denying Boeing's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, Jeff Nowak, a partner with law firm Franczek Radelet P.C. in Chicago, said, “Migraines can be deceptive for employers. Many employees deal with them and work through these kinds of headaches, so when an employee takes time off for a migraine headache, employers often don’t track those days as FMLA leave, even though the regulations clearly indicate that employers should.” ####  ##### Experts have said that employers run the risk of noncompliance with the FMLA when employees request intermittent leave for chronic health conditions, including migraines. #### "
"Bank of America ordered to pay $1.27B for Countrywide fraud","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Bank of America Corp. to pay $1.27 billion of damages after a federal jury found the second-largest U.S. bank liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan ruled nine months after jurors found Bank of America and former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone liable for defrauding government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through the sale of shoddy loans by the former Countrywide Financial Inc in 2007 and 2008. ####  ##### The case centered on a mortgage lending process known as “High Speed Swim Lane,” “HSSL” or “Hustle,” and which ended before Bank of America bought Countrywide in July 2008. ####  ##### Investigators said the program emphasized quantity over quality, rewarding employees for producing more loans and eliminating checkpoints designed to ensure the loans’ quality. ####  ##### “While the HSSL process lasted only nine months, it was from start to finish the vehicle for a brazen fraud by the defendants, driven by a hunger for profits and oblivious to the harms thereby visited, not just on the immediate victims but also on the financial system as a whole,” Judge Rakoff wrote. ####  ##### Judge Rakoff based the penalty on 17,611 Hustle-generated loans, for which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac paid $2.96 billion to Countrywide. He said the damages award reflected a finding by a government expert that only some of the loans had material defects, while others were acceptable. ####  ##### The government had sought $2.1 billion of penalties. Judge Rakoff also directed Ms. Mairone, a former mid-level Countrywide executive who was the only individual charged in the case, to pay $1 million. The government had sought about $1.2 million. ####  ##### Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the $1.27 billion award “simply bears no relation to a limited Countrywide program that lasted several months” and ended before the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank bought the company. “We’re reviewing the ruling and will assess our appellate options.” ####  ##### Ms. Mairone later began to work at JPMorgan Chase & Co., and used her maiden name of Rebecca Steele. Her lawyer, Marc Mukasey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York, who brought the case, declined to comment. ####  ##### Both defendants had denied wrongdoing and said they should not be penalized. Bank of America also said Countrywide actually lost money selling the loans once costs were factored in. #### "

"E.U. executive wants to beef up bloc's financial watchdogs","Risk Management","European Union, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers"," ##### (Reuters) — The European Union's trio of new financial watchdogs should have more powers over banks, insurers and markets to ensure national regulators apply E.U. rules, the bloc's executive body said on Friday in a review that may raise hackles in Britain. ####  ##### The European Commission's review looked at the three European Supervisory Authorities, or ESAs, set up in 2011 to improve oversight of the 28-country bloc's markets and banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis uncovered failings. ####  ##### The London-based European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, and Frankfurt, Germany-based European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority have performed well during their first three years but need stronger powers to assert themselves, the review found. ####  ##### ""In particular, the ESAs should give a higher profile to issues related to consumer/investor protection, and strengthen the focus on supervisory convergence,"" the European Commission said in a statement. ####  ##### Consumer protection has traditionally been left to national supervisors in the E.U. but this is now changing with ESMA being given powers to ban harmful products directly. ####  ##### Britain wants a new ""settlement"" with the E.U. to curb and reverse the shift of powers, particularly over finance, from national to E.U. level ahead of a possible in/out referendum on U.K. membership in 2017. ####  ##### The review recommends medium-term actions that would need changes in the law. ####  ##### The authority and role of chairmen of the ESAs could be strengthened to take ""swift decisions in the interest of the E.U. as a whole"", meaning making it harder for a national regulator to shield one of its banks or insurers from an E.U. rule. ####  ##### The authorities could also be given ""direct access to data"" so they would not have to rely on national regulators if they wanted to scrutinize a bank or market in more detail. ####  ##### Their remit could be extended to enforcing accounting rules, checking on how banks calculate their capital buffers and directly supervising clearing houses, all steps that would dilute the powers of national watchdogs. ####  ##### Currently, the ESAs are 60% funded by national governments with the rest from the E.U.'s budget, and the review said both sources should be abolished and that fees or levies on banks, insurers and markets would need to be analyzed. ####  ##### The review added that any fees or levies would be proportionate, meaning tailored to the size of a firm. ####  ##### The Commission also wants to see the authorities flex their ""binding mediation powers"" to order a national watchdog to comply with E.U. rules, a step none has wanted to take so far given the political sensitivities it would raise. ####  ##### There could also be a need for more radical structural changes such as locating all the authorities in one place. ####  ##### E.U. states and the European Parliament will now decide how to take forward the recommendations. ####  ##### Incoming European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said a ""capital markets union"" is one of his top themes, raising further concerns in Britain that Brussels will seek to centralize more power at the expense of London. ####  ##### The European Systemic Risk Board was also launched in 2011 and is based at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt to act like a helicopter hovering above the financial system to spot broader risks such as destabilizing asset bubbles. ####  ##### Jacques de Larosiere, the former IMF chief and key architect of the E.U. watchdogs, said last year that the ESRB was difficult to stir and get into action — one of its recommendations was made after a problem had already been solved. ####  ##### ""Europe needs a sailor at the top of the mast who looks at possible systemic dangers,"" Mr. de Larosiere told a hearing. ####  ##### The review said the ESRB had done important analysis of risks but needed streamlining and a more ""proactive communication strategy."" Further studies would be conducted to enhance the watchdog's ""visibility and autonomy."" ####  ##### The ESRB is chaired by ECB President Mario Draghi and the review said a new managing director role could strengthen the board's own identity. #### "

L.P. and TPG Capital L.P. will benefit shareholders of some merger targets during a buyout boom that predated the 2008 financial crisis. The settlement was disclosed in a Thursday court filing. ####  ##### Six defendants in the nearly 7-year-old lawsuit have now agreed to pay a combined $475.5 million in various settlements without admitting wrongdoing. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston will consider preliminary approval of the accords at a Sept. 4 hearing. ####  ##### Carlyle Group L.P. is the only remaining defendant among 11 firms originally sued, and faces a Nov. 3 trial. ####  ##### ""These claims are without merit and we will continue to vigorously contest the allegations,"" Carlyle said in a statement. ####  ##### In the December 2007 lawsuit, which relies heavily on email evidence, private equity firms were accused of conspiring to drive down takeover prices and reduce competition by following ""club rules,"" often teaming up on buyouts and providing quid pro quos to influence each other's behavior. ####  ##### The lawsuit now covers eight buyouts in which the firms allegedly agreed not to ""jump,"" or outbid, each other after buyouts were announced. ####  ##### ""It's a pretty good settlement,"" said Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ""Antitrust cases like this are tough, and there aren't many class action settlements approaching $500 million like this one."" ####  ##### In one case, soon after a KKR-led group agreed in July 2006 to buy hospital chain HCA Inc., a Blackstone executive allegedly wrote that the $32.1 billion price ""represents good value and is a shame we let KKR get away with highway robbery."" ####  ##### And after a Blackstone-led group in September 2006 beat out KKR to buy Freescale Semiconductor Inc. for $17.5 billion, Blackstone President Hamilton ""Tony"" James emailed KKR co-founder George Roberts that he would ""much rather"" work together, and that ""in opposition we can cost each other a lot of money."" ####  ##### Twenty-seven buyouts were originally part of the case. A federal judge in March 2013 threw out claims over alleged collusion before buyouts were announced. ####  ##### Other buyouts remaining in the case are movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Inc., food service firm Aramark Corp., casino operator Harrah's Entertainment Inc., pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc., software maker SunGard Data Systems Inc. and power company TXU Corp., now called Energy Future Holdings. ####  ##### Blackstone, KKR and TPG will apportion the $325 million payment among themselves. KKR said it settled to end the distraction and cost of litigating. Blackstone declined to comment. TPG was not immediately available to comment. ####  ##### Last month, Silver Lake Partners L.P. settled with the plaintiffs for $29.5 million. In June, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bain Capital Partners L.L.C. settled for a respective $67 million and $54 million. ####  ##### Carlyle had prior to Thursday signaled its plan to fight on. In an Aug. 1 court filing, it said the ""plaintiffs' entire case fails"" because they could not show that anyone, but for the alleged collusion, would have jumped others' buyouts. ####  ##### The case is Dahl et al. v.

"Nursing assistant fired in 15th week of pregnancy can sue: District Court","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A pregnant nursing assistant who was immediately fired during her 15th week of pregnancy, after she told her employers she could not lift 20 pounds once she reached her 20th week, can pursue her pregnancy discrimination claim, says a federal District Court. ####  ##### Araceli Cadenas’ job at the Meadowbrook Manor’s nursing and rehabilitation facility in Naperville, Illinois, required her to pull, push or lift at least 20 pounds as she fulfilled duties that included placing belts around residents’ chests or waists and using their own weight to pull and lift the resident up, according to the ruling by the federal District Court in Chicago in Araceli Cadenas v. Butterfield Health Care II, c/b/a Meadowbrook Manor of Naperville et al. ####  ##### Ms. Cadenas was terminated while she was 15 weeks pregnant, after she presented a doctor’s note stating she could not lift more than 20 pounds once she reached her 20th week of pregnancy, although at that point she could still work without restrictions, according to the ruling, which was issued July 15, but publicized last week. ####  ##### “At a minimum … Meadowbrook was entitled to fire Cadenas as of the 20th week of her pregnancy when, it is undisputed, she would no longer be able to do her job effectively,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “The question remains whether as a matter of law Meadowbrook could terminate Cadenas at 15 weeks of pregnancy before the restrictions took effect,” the ruling said. ####  ##### “Meadowbrook never suggested, or provided evidence, that there was any business reason not to let Cadenas work during the five weeks remaining before her restrictions went into effect,” the ruling said. ####  ##### “Without any physical restrictions applicable between weeks 15 and 20 of Cadenas pregnancy, Meadowbrook has pointed to no non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cadenas effectively immediately,” said the court. ####  ##### “A jury could reasonably conclude she was terminated in her 15th week for a reason other than physical limitations — namely, discrimination based upon her pregnancy,” said the court, in denying Meadowbrook motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### Last month, a pet food manufacturer that fired a lab technician an hour after learning she was pregnant, citing safety concerns for both mother and baby, agreed to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission pregnancy discrimination case for $30,000. #### "
"Low temperature a factor in Boeing 787 battery meltdown in Japan: Report","Risk Management","Japan"," ##### (Reuters) — Cold winter temperatures were a factor in the meltdown of a lithium ion battery that caused a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner to make an emergency landing in Japan last year, the Asahi newspaper said, citing the conclusions of local investigators. ####  ##### The battery meltdown on the ANA Holdings Inc.-owned plane prompted authorities to ground the global fleet of Dreamliners for more than three months. ####  ##### It followed an incident less than two weeks earlier at Boston Airport when a battery on a parked Japan Airlines 787 overheated and emitted white gases. ####  ##### Low temperatures can cause a lithium ion battery to deteriorate, resulting in the risk of a short circuit, Kyodo News reported separately. The battery is located in an unpressurized, unheated part of the plane. ####  ##### The Japan Transport Safety Board plans to release a final report on its findings as early as September, the Asahi said, without citing sources. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for accident investigators declined to comment on the report. ####  ##### Boeing won approval for Dreamliner flights to resume after it redesigned the battery compartment to isolate thermal events and vent hot gases outside the aircraft. ####  ##### The Dreamliner is Boeing's state-of-the-art plane, built with carbon-fiber composite materials and a powerful electrical system to reduce weight and improve the jet's fuel efficiency. #### "
"Alliant releases annual report on political risks in oil and gas frontier markets","Risk Management","Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Latin America, Middle East/Africa, Political Risk"," ##### Alliant Emerging Markets, a unit of Alliant Insurance Services Inc., has released its ranking of political risks in important oil and gas frontier markets, the Frontier Energy Risk Index. ####  ##### The yearly risk climate rankings are intended to give oil and gas companies an idea of changes in political risk levels in 14 different emerging economies with potential for producing oil and gas, the Newport Beach, California-based broker said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### The rankings are based on macroeconomic and political risk loss data, according to the statement. ####  ##### Ecuador had the largest positive gain (22%) from 2013 because of its improving macroeconomic forecast. Algeria and Libya are also considered less risky because of a “marginal reduction in war and civil war risk” in those countries, according to the rankings. ####  ##### Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Angola and Kazakhstan all had positive gains from 2013. Yemen remained the same. ####  ##### Egypt's rating increased by 5%, but investors and companies should still be cautious, the reports says. ####  ##### “Egypt has emerged from a long run of political instability, and a recent regime change to show some positive movement in our risk models,” Michel Léonard, chief economist with Alliant Emerging Markets, said in the statement. “However, we remain guarded about its long-term prospects and warn investors not to confuse gradual improvements with medium or long-term structural stability.” ####  ##### Indonesia had the biggest year-to-year downgrade with a 62% ratings drop. ####  ##### “The downgrade is largely due to the newly imposed restrictions on foreign investments, first in the mining sector, and now in the oil & gas sector,” Mr. Léonard said. “We expect this trend to continue regardless of the upcoming presidential elections.” ####  ##### Military tensions in the South China Sea mean that Vietnam is risky for oil and gas companies and investors, according to the rankings. ####  ##### “Chinese authorities' decision to move an oil rig into Vietnam's exclusive economic zone is the most notable of many recent confrontations between China and other countries in the South China Sea,” Mr. Léonard said. “In the long term, we expect China's actions to lead not to territorial expansion, but to China being granted rights to production in the waters it is claiming. Oil & gas companies should be aware of the changes this will bring to any current or future licensing agreements signed in the South China Sea, especially with Vietnam.” ####  ##### Thailand and Malaysia were also downgraded from their 2013 ratings. #### "
"Oil spill from power plant closes 15-mile stretch of Ohio River","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Energy"," ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Coast Guard closed a 15-mile stretch of the Ohio River on Tuesday after at least five thousand gallons of fuel oil spilled from a 60-year-old power plant owned by Duke Energy 20 miles east of Cincinnati. ####  ##### The spill occurred at 11:15 p.m. on Monday during a “routine transfer of fuel oil” at the W.C. Beckjord plant in New Richmond and was stopped 15 minutes later, Duke said. ####  ##### Intakes for drinking water along the river were closed overnight, and drinking water has not been affected, said a spokeswoman for the Greater Cincinnati Water Works, though tests continue. The impact on wildlife was so far unclear. ####  ##### “We notified state and local authorities of the incident and have been working with them throughout the overnight hours,” said Chuck Whitlock, Duke Energy president of Midwest Commercial Generation. “We have cleanup crews on site that are identifying the appropriate actions that will be needed to remediate.” ####  ##### The Coast Guard said the river was closed from mile markers 453 to 468, from Cincinnati to Dayton, Kentucky, while it responded to the spill. Three vessels were on the scene on Tuesday deploying oil containment booms and clean-up materials. The Coast Guard’s initial estimate was that 8,000 gallons were spilled. ####  ##### The W.C. Beckjord Station is being retired as a result of new government emissions standards. Four of the plant’s six coal-fired units have been closed, and the remaining two are expected to shut down by the end of the year. It also has four fuel-oil-fired units that generate power during periods of peak demand. ####  ##### The Ohio River, which stretches nearly 1,000 miles from Pennsylvania to Illinois, provides drinking water for more than three million people, according to the Ohio River Foundation. ####  ##### It is also a major artery for shipping grain by barge from the eastern United States to export terminals on the Gulf Coast. With the corn and soybean harvest still weeks away, however, traffic has been relatively light. ####  ##### “There is not a lot of stuff coming down the Ohio River right now, but four weeks from now it will be very busy,” said Roy Huckabay with the Linn Group, a Chicago brokerage. #### "

"Insurers can withstand $100B natural catastrophe: Zurich","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich"," ##### (Reuters) — The growing market for catastrophe bonds has bolstered the insurance industry to the extent it could cope with a $100 billion disaster bigger than Hurricane Katrina, the head of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.'s general insurance division said. ####  ##### Known as ""alternative capital,"" the money investors are pouring into catastrophe bonds — sold by insurers to share the risk they take on for natural disasters — and other areas of the insurance industry is increasing competition and putting pressure on traditional players. ####  ##### But the new capital also means the industry is more robust and able to cope with what Zurich's general insurance chief Michael Kerner sees as a growing trend of large catastrophe losses caused by climate change. ####  ##### ""The insurance and the reinsurance industry are at very strong levels of solvency, there is lots of capital in the business,"" Mr. Kerner told Reuters. ""The industry can handle a $100 billion event, all the claims get paid, it's not a big solvency issue."" ####  ##### ""We do need to access all forms of capital to be able to provide the appropriate risk transfer solutions. In this context, some of this alternative capital is really a good thing, because it has expanded the capacity of the insurance industry to be able to handle these bigger events,"" Mr. Kerner said. ####  ##### The natural catastrophe bond market issued record volumes during the second quarter, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory said in July, with investors attracted to the sector in search of higher returns as interest rates remain at rock-bottom levels. ####  ##### Katrina, in 2005, was one of the biggest hurricanes ever recorded and the costliest natural disaster, racking up $80 billion in damages for the insurance industry, according to 2013 data from reinsurer Swiss Re Ltd. ####  ##### Zurich took a hit of around $600 million after tax and reinsurance from the hurricane in 2005. ####  ##### The first half of 2014, however, has been relatively calm, with floods, storms and other natural disasters causing around $42 billion in damage worldwide, well below the prior-year period and a 10-year average, German reinsurer Munich Reinsurance Co. said in July. ####  ##### ""The area of risk potentially is that some of this capital is not actually being asked to respond,"" Mr. Kerner said. ""This is capital dedicated to catastrophe losses, but we have not had a major catastrophe in a while, so this capital has not yet been tested."" ####  ##### The capital will be able to stand the strain of a major natural catastrophe, Mr. Kerner said, adding the question was whether investors would be willing to replenish it afterwards. #### "
"Judge rejects Silicon Valley employee poaching lawsuit settlement agreement ","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A federal judge has refused to approve a settlement agreement between plaintiffs and high-tech firms over the issue of an alleged nonpoaching agreement among the Silicon Valley companies, stating the amount offered the workers was inadequate. ####  ##### A legal expert said the ruling represents a trend towards close judicial scrutiny of class action settlements. ####  ##### Despite the agreement between defendants and plaintiff attorneys, Judge Lucy H. Koh in the U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, on Friday refused to OK an agreement under which workers would receive $324.5 million to settle the class action litigation against Mountain View California-based Adobe Systems Inc., Cupertino, California-based Apple Inc., Mountain View-based Google Inc. and Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp. ####  ##### Plaintiffs had charged that the defendants had entered into an “overarching conspiracy through a series of bilateral agreements” to not solicit one another’s employees in violation of federal law, according to Judge Koh’s ruling in In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation. ####  ##### Judge Koh said under terms of the agreement, defendants will pay a total of $324.5 million, and workers will receive an average of about $3,750 each after $18 million in attorneys’ fees, $1.2 million in costs and $80,000 per class representative in incentive payments is deducted. There are about 64,000 affected workers, according to a news report. ####  ##### “The court finds the total settlement amount falls below the range of reasonableness,” she said. She said if this case had been settled on the same basis of a much weaker case against other defendants in related litigation, which was settled a year ago, plaintiffs would receive at least $380 million. ####  ##### Defendants in the case either had no comment or could not be reached. ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, defense attorney Michael W. Kelly, a partner with law firm Squire Patton Boggs L.L.P. in San Francisco, said: “From the defense bar’s perspective it’s significant, because it continues to represent close judicial scrutiny of settlement decisions between the parties in class actions, with the courts imposing their own assessment of the likelihood of success.” ####  ##### Mr. Kelly said if the two sides want to settle, “it is clear they would have to come back with a number that’s at least $380 million, if not in excess of $380 million.” #### "
"OFF BEAT: Puppet maker says CBS violated copyright on gassy stuffed hippo","Risk Management",""," ##### There are some phrases one simply never expects to encounter in a professional context — and until now, “the farting hippo” was certainly among them. ####  ##### Folkmanis Inc., an Emeryville, California-based puppet manufacturer, has sued CBS Broadcasting Inc. for illegally copying one of its stuffed animal designs for a line of merchandise related to the network’s “N.C.I.S.” television program. ####  ##### According to documents filed Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, “N.C.I.S.” has been using a stuffed hippopotamus manufactured by Folkmanis as a prop since 2003. On the show, the toy belongs to an eccentric U.S. Naval forensic scientist who has named it Bert the Farting Hippo. For comedic effect, a superimposed fart sound is emitted whenever one of the characters gives Bert a squeeze. ####  ##### Over time, the toy became a popular recurring gag on the show. CBS began selling replicas of Bert the Farting Hippo in 2010 that were purchased from Folkmanis. Two years later, the network allegedly switched to a Chinese manufacturer to supply the replica hippos, along with key chains, slippers and T-shirts bearing the stuffed animal’s likeness. ####  ##### Currently, all Bert the Farting Hippo merchandise has since been removed from the network’s online store. ####  ##### In its lawsuit, Folkmanis says the merchandise violates its copyright on the design of the original hippo. The company is seeking at least $733,000 in damages, which it says is roughly equivalent to CBS’ profits from the sale of the merchandise, plus an injunction barring the network from further sales of products bearing the contested design. ####  ##### In the meantime, there’s no word on whether the dispute will lead to an untimely “N.C.I.S.” ending for the flatulent Bert. #### "
"Philip Morris ordered to defend fraud suit over U.S. military vendors","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit against Philip Morris USA Inc. that claims the tobacco company defrauded the federal government by failing to sell cigarettes to military vendors at the lowest price. ####  ##### The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that a lower court judge should not have dismissed the lawsuit by Anthony Oliver, the president and CEO of Medallion Brands International Co., another cigarette company. ####  ##### The 2008 lawsuit against Philip Morris, an Altria Group Inc. company, concerns cigarette sales to the Navy Exchange Service Command and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, both of which operate facilities that sell products to military personnel and their families. ####  ##### Mr. Oliver said Philip Morris sold cigarettes to its affiliates at lower rates than those the government paid. The lawsuit claimed Philip Morris charged millions of dollars more each year than it should have. ####  ##### Philip Morris said in court papers that Mr. Oliver is simply a competitor who also sells cigarettes to the military and has “no inside information” about the claims. ####  ##### In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the lawsuit could proceed because the information on which it was based was not, as the lower court found, already publicly disclosed. ####  ##### The False Claims Act allows citizens, as well as the government, to bring claims. If they win, they receive a percentage of the damages. Lawsuits cannot be based on information that is already public. #### "

"Judge casts doubt on Hewlett-Packard shareholder settlement in Autonomy lawsuit","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. judge cast doubt on Monday over a proposed agreement struck between Hewlett-Packard Co. and plaintiff shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the computing giant's botched acquisition of Autonomy P.L.C. ####  ##### At a hearing Monday in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the settlement contained a ""potentially fatal"" provision, under which HP would hire shareholder attorneys to pursue claims against ex-Autonomy executives. He said that provision may prevent his approving the deal. ####  ##### Judge Breyer said he would not approve the proposed fees for shareholder lawyers. ####  ##### ""That's out,"" he said. Additionally, Judge Breyer said that in order to approve the remainder of the deal, the judge may have to conduct a separate inquiry into the merits of dismissing claims against HP officers, including current Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman. ####  ##### HP announced a $8.8 billion writedown in November 2012, just over one year after buying Autonomy, and linked more than $5 billion to accounting fraud and inflated financials by Autonomy executives. The British company and its executives have denied any wrongdoing. ####  ##### Under the terms of the settlement reached in June, shareholder attorneys agreed to drop all claims against HP's current and former executives, including Whitman, board members and advisers to the company. ####  ##### HP, in turn, agreed to team up with the shareholder attorneys to bring claims against former Autonomy executives, including Chief Executive Michael Lynch. The shareholder attorneys stand to recoup millions in fees. ####  ##### Multiple parties objected to the deal.

"Domino's not liable in franchisee's employment liability case: Calif. high court","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A franchisor cannot be held vicariously liable for the employment-related actions of its franchisee, says the California Supreme Court in a divided ruling. ####  ##### Taylor Patterson v. Domino's Pizza L.L.C. et al. involved a former employee of a Domino's Pizza franchisee, who sued the franchisor, a unit of Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan-based Domino's Pizza, along with the alleged harasser and the franchisee, for the sexual harassment she allegedly suffered from the harasser, who was a manager of the franchise where she worked. ####  ##### Ms. Patterson had claimed that because Domino's was the “employer” of persons working for the franchisee and the franchisee was a Domino's agent, Domino's could be held vicariously liable for the harasser's actions. ####  ##### The Ventura County, California, Superior Court trial court granted Domino's summary judgment dismissing the case, holding that Domino's did not control the franchisee's day-to-day operations. ####  ##### However, applying the same basic principles, the state appeals court in Ventura, California, reversed that ruling, holding that a “reasonable inference could be drawn” from the franchisee's contract with Domino's and its manager's reference guide, that the franchisee, Thousand Oaks California-based Sui Juris L.L.C., “lacked managerial independence.” ####  ##### In reversing the appellate court ruling, the state Supreme Court in San Francisco held in last week's 4-3 ruling that nothing in the franchisor-franchisee contract “granted Domino's any of the functions commonly performed by employers. All such rights and duties were allocated to Sui Juris,” including recruiting, hiring, training, scheduling for work, supervising, and paying employees.” ####  ##### Thus, “Domino's had no right or duty to control employment or personnel matters for Sui Juris,” said the majority opinion, in reversing the state appellate court ruling. ####  ##### The minority opinion held that “the majority places too much emphasis on the terms of the franchise agreement and not enough on the parties' real-world interaction.” ####  ##### The issue of the franchisor-franchisee relationship has recently attracted attention in light of a determination by the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel that McDonald's Corp. subsidiary Warrenville, Illinois-based McDonald's USA L.L.C., should be considered a “joint employer” with its franchisees, which could dramatically increase franchisors' potential liabilities should it become law. #### "
"Title IX class action lawsuit ruling against California school district upheld on appeal ","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A federal appellate court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of female high school athletes in a Chula Vista, California-based school district charging violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal civil rights law that prohibits gender discrimination in education. ####  ##### In a ruling in Veronica Ollier et al. v. Sweetwater Union High School District et al., a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco also upheld the lower court ruling that the school district had engaged in unlawful retaliation under Title IX when it fired its girls' softball coach. ####  ##### It upheld the district court's granting of injunctive relief on both issues. ####  ##### In litigation first filed in April 2007, the U.S. District Court in Pasadena, California, concluded Sweetwater violated Title IX by failing to provide equal treatment and benefits to female athletes at Castle Park High School in Chula Vista in nine different areas, including recruiting, training, equipment, scheduling and fundraising, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In its March 2009 ruling, the District Court also found that female students “were supervised by overworked coaches, provided with inferior competition and practice facilities, and received less publicity than male athletes.” ####  ##### “We conclude that Sweetwater has not fully and effectively accommodated the interests and abilities of its female athletes,” said the appellate panel, in affirming the lower court ruling. ####  ##### The appellate court also agreed with the District Court that the school district had engaged in retaliation in firing the girls' softball coach, Chris Martinez, after the father of two of the named plaintiffs complained to school administrators about inequalities for girls in the school's athletic programs. ####  ##### The school district found that Mr. Martinez was fired six weeks after the school's athletic director told him “he could be fired at any time for any reason — a comment the coach understood to be a threat he would be fired” if more complaints were made about the girls' softball facilities, said the ruling. ####  ##### “Coach Martinez gave softball players extra practice time and individualized attention, persuaded volunteer coaches to help with specialized skills, and arranged for the team to play in tournaments attended by college recruiters. The softball team was stronger with Coach Martinez than without him,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “Plaintiffs have alleged judicially cognizable injuries flowing from Sweetwater's retaliatory responses to Title IX complaints made by their parents and Coach Martinez,” said the panel, in affirming the lower court's ruling. #### "
"Bank of Montreal is sued over Tom Petters' Ponzi scheme","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — Bank of Montreal was sued Thursday by a trustee liquidating two Florida funds that claimed to have lost money in a Ponzi scheme operated by Minnesota businessman Thomas Petters. ####  ##### The lawsuit seeks to recoup $23.6 billion, more than six times the estimated $3.65 billion size of Mr. Petters' fraud, based on sums transferred by Mr. Petters over five years to an account at Marshall & Ilsley Bank, which Bank of Montreal now owns. ####  ##### ""There is no merit to these claims and we will defend ourselves vigorously,"" Carey Allen, a spokeswoman for Bank of Montreal's BMO Harris Bank unit, said in an emailed statement. ####  ##### The case was brought by Barry Mukamal, a trustee liquidating two funds known as Palm Beach Finance. ####  ##### These funds filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2009, just over a year after Mr. Petters' fraud was uncovered and his businesses were put into receivership. ####  ##### Thursday's lawsuit was filed with the U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, nearly six years after Mr. Petters' offices were raided by the FBI in September 2008. ####  ##### Mr. Petters, now 57, was convicted in December 2009 on all 20 criminal counts he faced, including fraud and money laundering, and is serving a 50-year prison term. ####  ##### Prosecutors accused him of using one of his companies to bilk investors who thought he was using their money to buy consumer electronics for resale to retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp. and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. ####  ##### In his lawsuit, Mr. Mukamal said Marshall & Ilsley Bank knew the ""astronomical"" activity in Mr. Petters' account bore no relationship to Mr. Petters' alleged business and that Mr. Petters was involved in money laundering on an ""unprecedented scale."" ####  ##### But he said the Milwaukee-based bank did nothing, hoping instead to expand its ""important"" and ""substantial"" relationship with Mr. Petters. The trustee also said Marshall & Ilsley did not use good faith in handling money flows. ####  ##### Bank of Montreal bought Marshall & Ilsley in 2011. ####  ##### Florida lies within the 11th federal judicial circuit, which also includes Alabama and Georgia. ####  ##### In 2010, the federal appeals court in that circuit said an initial recipient of a debtor's fraudulently transferred funds can avoid liability for the transfer if it served merely as a ""conduit"" for the debtor, was an ""innocent participant"" in the transfer, and acted in good faith. ####  ##### ""Tom Petters ran the third-largest financial fraud in United States history through a single bank account at M&I Bank,"" the trustee's lawyer Solomon Genet said. ""We look forward to proceeding before a Florida jury."" ####  ##### The case is Mukamal v. BMO Harris Bank NA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No. 14-01660. #### "
"JPMorgan Chase replaces some credit cards after Home Depot breach","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. is replacing some credit and debit cards following the security breach at Home Depot Inc., a company spokesman said. ####  ##### The company began sending notices Tuesday to some card holders, advising them that they will soon receive new cards because the breach put them ""at risk."" ####  ##### One of the notices said the company would mail a new card on Sept. 30. The existing card can be used in the meantime, but the notice advised monitoring the account for unrecognized purchases. ####  ##### JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick could not immediately say how many cards are likely to be replaced. ####  ##### Home Depot disclosed on Sept. 8 that its payment security systems had been breached. The company is investigating how much account data might have been taken as customers paid for purchases in the United States and Canada from April through August. ####  ##### The spokesman could not immediately say why the bank moved now to replace the cards or discuss how it balanced the goals of thwarting fraud and minimizing inconvenience to customers. ####  ##### After card data was taken from Target Corp. stores in December, JPMorgan quickly canceled some debit cards that were threatened and asked customers to go to branches for replacements. ####  ##### JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and one of the biggest card issuers. It issues cards under its Chase brand and under co-branding relationships with some airlines and hotel chains, such as United, Southwest and Marriott. ####  ##### The notice to card holders said customers will not be liable for unauthorized transactions that they report promptly to the company. The company said it would continue to monitor accounts to help identify unusual activity. ####  ##### After confirming the breach, Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially affected customers. ####  ##### The retailer had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year to prevent card fraud. ####  ##### Brian Krebs, who runs the security website KrebsOnSecurity and first reported the Home Depot breach, said earlier this month that it could be larger than the attack on Target in which hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data during that retailer's busiest season. ####  ##### Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of the expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks. ####  ##### The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos. Inc., operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months. #### "

Hendrickson, in the statement. “Federal law assures pregnant women that they have the same right as other people to earn a living.” ####  ##### “The ADA requires employers to engage in discussions with employees they believe to be disabled before taking any action which would affect their employment rights. We’re pleased that the consent decree in this case provides fair compensation to Ms. Sternemann for the violation of her rights and includes terms which should preclude similar problems in the future,” Mr. Hendrickson said. ####  ##### The company’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### The EEOC’s issuance in July of updated guidance for pregnancy discrimination has generated controversy as legal experts debate the scope and timing of the new rules. #### "

"Chesapeake Energy to face racketeering charges in Michigan trial","Risk Management","Energy"," ##### (Reuters) — Natural gas and oil producer Chesapeake Energy Corp. must face trial on charges of felony racketeering and using false pretenses related to its land-leasing practices, a state judge has ruled. ####  ##### Cheboygan District Court Judge Maria Barton ruled on Monday that Oklahoma-based Chesapeake go to trial on one charge of racketeering and 20 counts of using false pretenses to allegedly defraud private landowners in the state during an oil and gas leasing boom in 2010. Barton ruled after a hearing last month. No trial date has been set. ####  ##### State Attorney General Bill Schuette brought the charges against Chesapeake in June, alleging the company directed its leasing agents to lock up land positions in the state by offering signing bonuses to private landowners. ####  ##### Later, when Chesapeake's competitors in the region slowed down their leasing, Chesapeake's agents allegedly canceled the deals, claiming that mortgages on the properties were grounds for not honoring the deals after earlier assurances that would not be an issue. ####  ##### As a result, Chesapeake obtained “uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land,” the state charged. ####  ##### In a statement, Chesapeake said it believes the charges are without merit and expects to prevail at trial. ####  ##### “We continue to believe the Attorney General is attempting to criminalize basic contract disputes,” said company spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. “Chesapeake remains focused on moving past these legacy issues from 2010 and executing our business strategies to drive profitable growth.” ####  ##### The criminal charges against Chesapeake followed a 2011 investigation by Reuters into the company's land-leasing tactics during a speculative leasing boom in the northern part of the state during 2010, including its use of a shell company to cancel land deals with more than 800 private landowners. ####  ##### Chesapeake, which was then led by CEO Aubrey McClendon who later left the company amid allegations of mismanagement, has denied wrongdoing. ####  ##### Mr. Schuette's office said the racketeering charge is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. The 20 counts of using false pretenses are punishable by fines of $10,000 for each count, or triple the value of the money or property involved, whichever is greater. ####  ##### Chesapeake will also go on trial in Michigan on antitrust charges for its alleged role in bid-rigging at a state land auction in 2010, following an earlier ruling by Judge Barton in July. ####  ##### In that case, Chesapeake is charged with colluding with a competitor, Encana Corp., to suppress land lease values in the state in 2010. ####  ##### Michigan officials began looking into their activities in 2012 after a Reuters investigation found that executives from the two companies discussed proposals to divide bidding responsibilities in a state land auction and in deals with several private landowners. Chesapeake has denied any wrongdoing. #### "

"New 'Bash' software bug may pose bigger threat than 'Heartbleed'","Risk Management","Risk Management, Tech Insights"," ##### (Reuters) — A newly discovered security bug in a widely used piece of Linux software, known as “Bash,” could pose a bigger threat to computer users than the “Heartbleed” bug that surfaced in April, cyber experts warned on Wednesday. ####  ##### Bash is the software used to control the command prompt on many Unix computers. Hackers can exploit a bug in Bash to take complete control of a targeted system, security experts said. ####  ##### The Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or US-CERT, issued an alert saying the vulnerability affected Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X. ####  ##### The “Heartbleed” bug allowed hackers to spy on computers but not take control of them, according to Dan Guido, chief executive of a cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits. ####  ##### “The method of exploiting this issue is also far simpler. You can just cut and paste a line of code and get good results.” ####  ##### Tod Beardsley, an engineering manager at cybersecurity firm Rapid7, warned the bug was rated a “10” for severity, meaning it has maximum impact, and rated “low” for complexity of exploitation, meaning it is relatively easy for hackers to launch attacks. ####  ##### “Using this vulnerability, attackers can potentially take over the operating system, access confidential information, make changes, et cetera,” Mr. Beardsley said. “Anybody with systems using Bash needs to deploy the patch immediately.” ####  ##### US-CERT advised computer users to obtain operating systems updates from software makers. It said that Linux providers including Red Hat Inc. had already prepared them, but it did not mention an update for OS X. Apple representatives could not be reached. ####  ##### Tavis Ormandy, a Google Inc. security researcher, said via Twitter that the patches seemed “incomplete.” Ormandy could not be reached to elaborate, but several security experts said a brief technical comment provided on Twitter raised concerns. ####  ##### “That means some systems could be exploited even though they are patched,” said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer with security software maker Veracode. ####  ##### He said corporate security teams had spent the day combing their networks to find vulnerable machines and patch them, and they would likely be taking other precautions to mitigate the potential for attacks in case the patches proved ineffective. ####  ##### “Everybody is scrambling to patch all of their Internet-facing Linux machines. That is what we did at Veracode today,” he said. “It could take a long time to get that done for very large organizations with complex networks.” ####  ##### “Heartbleed,” discovered in April, is a bug in an open-source encryption software called OpenSSL. The bug put the data of millions of people at risk as OpenSSL is used in about two-thirds of all websites. It also forced dozens of technology companies to issue security patches for hundreds of products that use OpenSSL. ####  ##### Bash is a shell, or command prompt software, produced by the non-profit Free Software Foundation. Officials with that group could not be reached for comment. #### "
"Barclays takes $77M hit from British and U.S. fines","Risk Management","United Kingdom"," ##### (Reuters) — British bank Barclays P.L.C. was hit with a combined $77 million in fines from British and U.S. regulators on Tuesday as the lender continues to be dogged by problems from its past. ####  ##### Barclays was fined £38 million ($61.9 million) by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority for exposing customers to unnecessary risks by failing to ensure that client assets were properly safeguarded and adequate records kept. ####  ##### Hours later, it was hit with a $15 million fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for lax internal compliance processes after its takeover of the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. ####  ##### The SEC said Barclays will be required to undertake certain remedial steps, including the hiring of an independent compliance consultant. ####  ##### The U.S. regulator said Barclays failed to enhance its compliance program when it bought Lehman's advisory business after the U.S. bank's collapse. The shortcomings, the SEC said, led Barclays to commit a variety of other violations of federal laws governing investment advisers. ####  ##### It said the violations resulted in overcharging and client losses of approximately $472,000 and additional revenue to Barclays of more than $3.1 million. The bank has since reimbursed or credited affected clients about $3.8 million, the SEC said. ####  ##### Barclays is trying to improve standards and its corporate culture after being rocked by a series of scandals — including the mis-selling of loan insurance and the attempted manipulation of Libor interest rates — which raised concern about lax standards. ####  ##### Earlier on Tuesday, the FCA imposed its highest fine for client asset breaches and said there were ""significant weaknesses"" in Barclays' systems and controls between November 2007 and January 2012 that put £16.5 billion ($26.88 billion) of client assets at risk. ####  ##### The FCA, which has tightened rules governing client asset protection since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, said that customers risked incurring extra costs, lengthy delays or losing their assets if the bank had become insolvent. ####  ##### ""Barclays failed to apply the lessons from our previous enforcement actions, numerous industrywide warnings and exposed its clients to unnecessary risk,"" said Tracey McDermott, the head of enforcement and financial crime at the FCA. ####  ##### ""All firms should be clear after Lehman that there is no excuse for failing to safeguard client assets."" ####  ##### Barclays, which said it did not profit from these failings and that no customer had lost money, qualified for a 30% fine reduction because it cooperated with the FCA. This reduced the penalty from an original £54 million ($88 million). ####  ##### ""Barclays identified and self-reported to the FCA the issues giving rise to the FCA's findings and we accept their conclusion,"" the bank said in an emailed statement. ""Barclays has subsequently enhanced its systems to resolve these issues and to ensure we have the requisite processes in place."" ####  ##### Barclays said the SEC's action related to activity between 2009 and 2011 and it had since strengthened its supervisory and control environment. #### "

"SEC announces $30M payout in largest whistleblower award","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — An anonymous tipster living abroad will receive $30 million in the largest whistleblower award ever doled out by U.S. securities regulators as part of a program that aims to encourage insiders to report wrongdoing. ####  ##### The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that the whistleblower provided crucial information that helped investigators uncover a “difficult to detect” ongoing fraud. ####  ##### “This record-breaking award sends a strong message about our commitment to whistleblowers and the value they bring to law enforcement,” SEC Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney said. ####  ##### The SEC won new powers in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to entice whistleblowers with monetary awards. Prior to the new law, the SEC was only able to reward people for helping on insider-trading cases. ####  ##### The new program lets the SEC pay a whistleblower who provides tips and original information that leads to an enforcement action with sanctions that exceed $1 million. ####  ##### The SEC can award a whistleblower anywhere between 10% and 30% of the money the agency collects. ####  ##### By law, the SEC is not allowed to reveal the identity of whistleblowers, and so as a result it does not disclose which case a whistleblower helped to crack. ####  ##### Settlements with the SEC large enough to justify a $30 million award are uncommon. ####  ##### Monday's announcement marks the fourth time the SEC has agreed to award a whistleblower living abroad — a fact that the agency said demonstrates the “international breadth” of the program. ####  ##### Since the inception of the program in fiscal year 2012, the SEC has awarded more than a dozen whistleblowers. Monday's $30 million award is more than double the previous record of $14 million, awarded to a whistleblower in 2013. #### "
"Sheplers western wear stores reveal data breach ","Risk Management",""," ##### Western wear retail chain Sheplers said it has experienced a data breach in which hackers gained access to its systems and some of its customers' payment card information over almost a three-month period that ended earlier this month. ####  ##### A company spokeswoman said Monday that at this point the company is aware of “a few dozen” customers who have reported fraud. She said the retailer does not have cyber insurance. ####  ##### Wichita, Kansas-based Sheplers, which has 21 stores in eight states, said in its announcement Friday that the breach potentially affects customers who used payment cards at its retail locations between June 11 and Sept. 4, 2014. It said the information at risk includes names, account numbers for both credit cards and debit cards, and card expiration dates. ####  ##### The retailer said it has found no evidence that debit card PINs have been compromised, and it does not believe that social security numbers, which are not stored on payment cards, could have been accessed. ####  ##### The company said it first learned about the breach from an informal tip from a financial institution, which was later confirmed by an investigation. “We have implemented new security measures, and we resumed processing credit cards in our stores only after determining that it was safe to do so,” said the retailer, which is offering its clients a credit monitoring service. ####  ##### It is also encouraging its customers to review their credit and debit card statements for evidence of unauthorized charges. #### "
"DSW to pay $900K to settle case of age bias in layoffs","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### DSW Inc., formerly known as Designer Shoe Warehouse, has agreed to pay $900,000 to settle an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission age discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with firing employees over the age of 40 years old during a reduction in force, the agency said Monday. ####  ##### The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer denied the charges in a statement, and said it settled the case to reduce litigation expenses. ####  ##### The EEOC said DSW had violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and discriminated against seven former management employees in its Midwest region, and a class of former employees, by terminating older employees because of their age, and retaliating against certain employees who had opposed the orders to discriminate. The EEOC said its complaint covered DSW field personnel in its Midwest region as well as corporate home office employees. ####  ##### The EEOC said its lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Sept. 15, and DSW decided to immediately negotiate the settlement. The consent decree settling the case was filed with the court Friday. ####  ##### In addition to providing $900,000 in monetary relief to the alleged victims, the settlement requires DSW to report to the EEOC for the next three years all employee complaints of age discrimination arising out of the regions covered by the decree, the agency said. ####  ##### The company is also required to train all its employees in these locations on the prevention and eradication of age discrimination and revise its antidiscrimination policy, the EEOC said. ####  ##### John Hendrickson, the EEOC’s regional attorney in Chicago, said in a statement, “We’re pleased that DSW worked to resolve this suit so quickly, without the need to go through expensive and time-consuming litigation. ####  ##### “Instead, DSW chose to focus on making changes in its workplace and compensating victims. As a result, the day when those put out of work are compensated and the day when DSW is able to again focus 100% on its business will be here sooner rather than later.” ####  ##### DSW said in an emailed statement, “DSW unequivocally denies the claims made by the EEOC. The EEOC’s allegations focus on employee separations during 2008 and 2009. Those difficult decisions were driven by economic volatility and were in no way influenced by the age of associates. Our decision to settle this case mitigates the costs associated with a lengthy legal proceeding and is in the best interest of our associates and shareholders. ####  ##### “Additionally, the company is directing any unclaimed benefits from the settlement to a selected non-profit organization that provides job placement and training services to the local community [of Chicago].” #### "

At Wells Fargo, we value our team members' diversity. We are committed to building and sustaining a diverse and inclusive culture for all Wells Fargo team members and have zero tolerance for any form of discrimination.” ####  ##### The EEOC also said Wednesday that Prestige Transportation Service L.L.C., a Miami company that provides transportation services to airline personnel to and from Miami International Airport, will pay $200,000 to settle a race discrimination and retaliation lawsuit, in connection with actions allegedly committed under different ownership. ####  ##### The EEOC charged in its suit that Prestige’s predecessor company, Airbus Alliance Inc., repeatedly instructed its human resource manager to not hire African-American applicants because they were “trouble” and “would sue the company.” ####  ##### Its owners also used a derogatory term for one employee and fired her after she filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, the agency said. The EEOC said also Airbus terminated its human resources manager and another employee once they opposed the company’s discriminatory practices. ####  ##### Payments will be made to three named claimants as well as a class of black applicants for employment under the settlement agreement.

"New PCI chairman monitors federal regulatory posture","Risk Management","P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers"," ##### For Terrence W. Cavanaugh, a challenge facing the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America is continuing to provide effective advocacy for its members and the industry in a rapidly evolving risk landscape. ####  ##### That means commercial and personal lines insurers alike, said Mr. Cavanaugh, who assumed the PCI chairmanship Tuesday during this year’s annual conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. ####  ##### “Our challenge is to make sure we have the right talent and the right place to have the right discussion to promote our industry,” the president and CEO of Erie, Pennsylvania-based Erie Insurance Group said. ####  ##### “We want to make sure that we protect the economy from terrorism,” whether it stems from domestic and/or foreign sources, he said. Not surprisingly, the reauthorization of the federal government’s terrorism insurance backstop program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 “is a big issue for us,” he said. ####  ##### The program will lapse on Dec. 31 unless Congress reauthorizes it. The Senate has passed a measure that would extend the program for seven years, but the full House has yet to move on a bill approved by the House Financial Services Committee that would extend the program for only five years, as well as make other changes to the program. ####  ##### The bills differ in other ways. Advocates of the program hope that differences will be resolved and that both houses will approve an extension during next month’s lame-duck session. ####  ##### Another issue facing PCI is “the evolving role of the federal government in our business,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. PCI is trying to make sure that any federal role works for the industry and the consumer. He said the trade group seeks to assure that any federal role in the traditionally state-based regulation of insurance is “appropriate” and “promotes a sound private insurance industry.” ####  ##### “If we’re an effective advocacy organization,” PCI will grow and increase its influence, he said. Mr. Cavanaugh cited looking at issues such as the proper regulation of the commercial ride-sharing industry as an example. To be an effective trade organization, PCI works to make sure that it’s a credible source of information for the industry, regulators and to some extent consumers, too. ####  ##### Looking to the future, Mr. Cavanaugh said that the industry must draw talented young people to its ranks. “We sell an intangible that is sometimes difficult for new entrants in the business to comprehend,” he said. ####  ##### He said that when he talks to college students and other candidates, he talks about the “diversity of jobs available,” and stresses that “we’re the glue and the grease of the economy.” ####  ##### “By virtue of our balance sheets and risk transfer, we allow the organizations to remain stable,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. “Nothing happens without risk transfer. We’ve got to get that story out.” #### "
"Dallas company to pay $499,000 for sexual harassment, retaliation firings","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A six-person jury for the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, has awarded three former employees of a Dallas-based physician services provider nearly $500,000 in a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency said Monday. ####  ##### Gloria Stokes, a former executive assistant for EmCare Holdings Inc., was awarded $250,000 in punitive damages based on the claim that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor, division CEO Jim McKinney, according to a statement by the EEOC. ####  ##### Meanwhile, credentialer Bonnie Shaw and recruiter Luke Trahan, were awarded $82,000 and $167,000, respectively, for retaliatory discharge, according to the statement released after Friday's decision. ####  ##### Ms. Shaw and Mr. Trahan, who worked in the AnesthesiaCare Division of EmCare, said they told human resources personnel that Mr. McKinney made an inappropriate remark to Ms. Shaw's daughter, who was 15 years old at the time, during a Bring Your Child to Work Day event, according to the statement. Both Ms. Shaw and Mr. Trahan were fired six weeks later for “performance issues.” ####  ##### “Ms. Stokes, Ms. Shaw, and Mr. Trahan spent their time at EmCare working diligently to do their jobs well despite the pervasive sexual environment that human resources allowed Jim McKinney to create and perpetuate,” EEOC senior trial attorney Meaghan Shepard said in the statement. “Their complaints were ignored, and instead of getting support from HR, Ms. Shaw and Mr. Trahan were fired for daring to speak out against the division CEO. By today's verdict, it is clear that all three have finally been heard.” #### "
"Outgoing chairman proud of PCI's thought leadership","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### The Property Casualty Insurers Association of America is in great shape as he makes an exit, outgoing Chairman Robert Restrepo said. ####  ##### Mr. Restrepo, who is chairman, CEO and president of State Auto Insurance Cos. of Columbus, Ohio, said that's because PCI President David Sampson has “recruited and developed a terrific staff,” which has allowed the group to be a thought leader in the industry. ####  ##### That's been particularly important during the year of Mr. Restrepo's chairmanship. Working toward PCI's top priority — reauthorization of the federal terrorism insurance program created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 — has not been easy. Congress has yet to renew the program, which is slated to expire on Dec. 31, but appears likely to vote on the issue during next month's lame-duck session. ####  ##### “We would have preferred to have the bill passed and signed earlier,” Mr. Restrepo said. There is a “great need for the type of security TRIA will provide,” he said, adding that he's reasonably confident it will be renewed before the end of the year. ####  ##### He said PCI has been able to provide information to senators and congressmen regarding what would happen if TRIA were not passed by Congress. ####  ##### “I'm very proud of the association being a thought leader in providing information,” he said. ####  ##### Another issue that has continued to evolve this year is global regulatory convergence. “As an industry, we used to be concerned about Washington” becoming more involved in insurance regulation, he said. Now the issue is international regulation, he said. ####  ##### PCI has been trying to educate regulators about why the state-based regulatory system is best. “Why would we want to adopt what we think is a bank-centric regulatory system when the current system is working fine?” Mr. Restrepo said. ####  ##### PCI also has had to respond to economic developments such as the emergence of commercial ride-sharing ventures, he said. The result has been the creation of what he calls “real gaps in insurance coverage for both the folks who are driving as part of this transportation network, as well as people riding,” he said. PCI has been “very aggressive” in working with regulators and legislators about confronting the risks involved, Mr. Restrepo said. ####  ##### “To a large degree PCI's challenges reflect the challenges of its members,” he said. “The rate of change has accelerated on all fronts.” ####  ##### In addition to regulatory trends, insurers must deal with a changing workforce. ####  ##### The property/casualty insurance industry is “going to lose hundreds of thousands of people over the next five to 10 years,” he said. ####  ##### Recruiting is a challenge for all of PCI's members, Mr. Restrepo said, and he sees the industry group continuing to provide role models and information to a new generation of professionals entering the industry. #### "
"Terrorism backstop extension, financial regulations top PCI agenda","Risk Management","P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Terrorism"," ##### Securing an extension of the federal terrorism insurance backstop created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 tops the agenda for the Property and Casualty Insurers Association of America, but it’s far from the organization’s sole concern. ####  ##### The insurer trade group has considerably more on its plate, including regulatory issues and unforeseen aspects of emerging ride-sharing businesses, PCI President David Sampson said. ####  ##### “The most important priority for the remainder of 2014 is to secure the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which expires Dec. 31,” he said. “That has been our top federal legislative priority for this year.” ####  ##### “I don’t think anyone believes that it is in the best interests of the nation or the economy, at a time of significantly heightened international terrorist threats upon the homeland, that this program expire,” Mr. Sampson said. ####  ##### He seemed optimistic that a resolution could be reached. ####  ##### “There’s been a lot of progress throughout the course of the year,” he said, noting that the Senate had approved reauthorization by a 94-3 vote and that the House Financial Services Committee passed a version of the bill this summer. ####  ##### “Every indication we have had from our extensive and ongoing visits with key leaders on the Hill is that everyone recognizes this is a ‘must do’ piece of legislation,” Mr. Sampson said. ####  ##### He pointed to the nearly unanimous nature of the Senate vote. “It’s pretty miraculous when you consider the gridlock and hyper-partisanship in Washington that you could have an overwhelmingly bipartisan support for reauthorization of this federal backstop,” he said. ####  ##### The question now is the “end game,” Mr. Sampson said. “That will be our top priority as we look forward to Congress coming back for the lame-duck session after the (November) election.” ####  ##### Also on the PCI agenda of critical priorities is “the continuing global regulatory convergence that would seek to impose one-size-fits-all bank-centric capital and regulatory standards on the insurance industry,” he said. ####  ##### “This is an issue that has continued to grow over the past year,” Mr. Sampson said, as international regulatory bodies “are becoming more and more opaque and less open in terms of the process by which they make these decisions.” ####  ##### Along the same lines, the organization will continue trying to pare similar efforts made by the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. ####  ##### “There’s been a lot of progress this year on a fix to the Collins Amendment, which imposed bank-centric-type capital standards on insurers as part of the Dodd-Frank Act,” Mr. Sampson said. ####  ##### The emergence of insurance issues related to the evolving U.S. economy, including services such as ride-share startup Uber, also have landed on PCI’s plate. ####  ##### These issues “kind of exploded onto the scene this year” after a tragic fatal accident involving an Uber driver and a young girl in San Francisco on New Year’s Eve 2013, he said. ####  ##### “We have expended very serious effort on that set of issues this year with some very significant developments,” Mr. Sampson said, referring to the passage of a California law that seeks to establish insurance requirements for such ride-share companies. ####  ##### “We hope the California law will become a model law for other states,” he said. #### "
"Insurers fight to bar cyber coverage under commercial general liability policies","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Tech Insights"," ##### Recent legal efforts by insurers to bar cyber coverage under commercial general liability policies signal a new coverage battle between insurers and policyholders as costly data breaches proliferate. ####  ##### In the latest move, a Travelers Cos. unit earlier this month sought a judicial ruling that it is not obligated to provide indemnity coverage and defense costs under its commercial general liability policy for P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. in connection with the restaurant chain's data breach that occurred from October 2013 through June 2014. ####  ##### The Insurance Services Office Inc.'s recent revisions to its standard commercial general liability policy forms exclude cyber coverage. But it will take some time for these forms to become more widely adopted in the market, and there are numerous older policy forms, at least some of which have ambiguous language, experts say. ####  ##### Furthermore, many firms still do not have cyber insurance policies, leaving their commercial general liability policies as possibly the only source of coverage for the exorbitant costs associated with a major data breach. ####  ##### And even for those firms with cyber policies, general liability policies, unlike their cyber counterparts, provide broader coverage, including offering defense costs that are outside the policy limits, experts say. ####  ##### Policyholders' success in obtaining cyber-related coverage under their general liability policies has been mixed. In February, for instance, a New York judge held that Zurich America Insurance Co. is not obligated to cover Sony Corp. of America for litigation related to the 2011 hacking of its PlayStation Network under Sony's general liability policy. ####  ##### Travelers asserts in its court filing that the “property damage” covered in its commercial general liability policy does not include loss or damage to “electronic media and records.” In August, P.F. Chang's disclosed that customer data from credit and debit cards used at 33 of its 211 P.F. Chang's eateries were pilfered. ####  ##### “The track record of companies trying to get coverage under a CGL policy has not worked out too well,” said Scott L. Vernick, a policyholder attorney and a partner with Fox Rothschild L.L.P. in Philadelphia. “The Sony decision was a very troubling decision in this area.” ####  ##### Insurers' position that cyber risks are not covered under general liability policies is based on policy language, as well as their contention it was never their intent to provide the coverage. ####  ##### The Travelers case is a “clear sign that the CGL carriers are extremely protective of their policy trigger,” said Adam Cottini, managing director, insurance and risk management in North America at Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. in New York. ####  ##### General liability insurers generally are not interested in suing their customers, but “this is one of those moments where it's large enough of an issue where Travelers is willing to obviously accept the negative connotation of using their own insured” for the purposes of a larger issues, Mr. Cottini said. ####  ##### “I don't think we're going to see a lot of these cases,” but it is important for insurers to set a precedent on this issue so both clients and policyholders “know where the coverage resides and where it doesn't,” said John Coletti, New York- based chief underwriting officer for cyber and technology at XL Group P.L.C., who stated insurers never intended for commercial general liability policies to cover cyber events. ####  ##### “Obviously, the carriers are going to continue to fight hard to deny coverage under the CGL policies, claiming there's no property damage liability in these types of situations, so it's going to be battleground and a fight, but it's still an important issue that needs to be looked at,” said David E. Weiss, a policyholder attorney with Reed Smith L.L.P. in San Francisco. ####  ##### Mr. Weiss said policyholders' success in obtaining coverage under their general liability policies is going “depend a lot on the facts of individual cases,” whether they can claim there was physical injury to property or loss of use of property. ####  ##### Joshua Gold, a shareholder with policyholder law firm Anderson Kill P.C. in New York, said, “I don't think it's terribly ambiguous to begin with, which is I think most policyholders should have personal injury coverage for a violation of privacy complaint, unless the policy has an express exclusion for a computer hacking incident.” ####  ##### ISO's recent publication of a cyber exclusion “is an indication that the policies are supposed to be read to cover those, otherwise what's the point of the exclusion?” he asked. ####  ##### William Boeck, senior vice president, insurance and claims counsel, for the Lockton Cos., in Kansas City, Missouri, said he advises his clients never to rely on commercial general liability policies for coverage of cyber risks. ####  ##### “I would always prefer that clients have certainty on this issue, and if they rely on their general liability policy to cover cyber risks, the only thing certain is they will have a fight with their insurer over coverage,” he said. He said more policyholders are buying cyber policies “so they have certainty on the issue.” ####  ##### A prudent policyholder should not “just pick one policy and put all their eggs in one basket,” said Kevin Kalinich, Chicago-based global practice leader of cyber risk insurance at Aon Risk Solutions. ####  ##### Policyholders should seek cyber coverage under any applicable policy, which could include property, crime, kidnap and ransom, and professional liability, as well as a specific cyber policy, he said. ####  ##### He added in these cases an issue may arise under the “other insurance clause” on many policies, which states that the particular policy is excess of any other policy in covering the same issue. #### "
"Northrop must face whistleblower anti-missile lawsuit","Risk Management","Middle East/Africa"," ##### (Reuters) — A Chicago federal judge on Thursday rejected Northrop Grumman Corp.'s bid to dismiss a lawsuit by a former employee who accused the defense contractor of defrauding the U.S. government in performing a contract to develop a missile defense system for commercial aircraft. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Manish Shah said the employee, Illinois resident Leo Danielides, plausibly alleged that Northrop induced the government in 2006 to award it the third phase of the “Counter-MANPADS” project through false statements, and lied about its performance when seeking periodic payments. ####  ##### The contract ended in 2008, and federal funding for the Counter-MANPADS project was later canceled. Mr. Danielides sued under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on the government's behalf and share in recoveries. ####  ##### Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said the Falls Church, Virginia-based company does not discuss litigation. ####  ##### The Counter-MANPADS project overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was designed to protect civilian airliners from shoulder-fired missiles after a failed attack in 2002 against an Israeli aircraft taking off from Mombasa, Kenya. ####  ##### According to the complaint, Northrop's performance in the project's first two phases was a key factor in its winning the third phase, where it was expected to use its “best efforts” to test the defense system and fix problems. ####  ##### However, according to Mr. Danielides, who said he worked on the project for “many years,” despite being paid more than $62 million in the third phase, Northrop did “virtually nothing” to improve the design and reliability of the system. ####  ##### In letting most of the case go forward, Judge Shah said Mr. Danielides alleged Northrop and the government agreed on a “specific, shared definition” of what “best efforts” meant: completing a task, or spending money in a legitimate effort to complete it. ####  ##### To prevail, Mr. Danielides will need to show Northrop knew what “best efforts” meant, and as a result lied when seeking payments, Judge Shah said. ####  ##### The judge dismissed one claim concerning a $3 million addition to the Counter-MANPADS project, known as Mod 8. ####  ##### “Our client is very pleased by the decision, and looks forward to pursuing the case,” Mr. Danielides' lawyer Michael Behn said in a telephone interview. #### "
"Dialysis firm to pay $350M to settle physician kickback charges","Risk Management",""," ##### A national dialysis services provider has agreed to pay $350 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit involving Justice Department charges that it violated the False Claims Act by paying kickbacks to induce physicians to refer patients to its clinics, the DOJ said Wednesday. ####  ##### The department said that between March 2005 and February 2014, Denver-based DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc., which has dialysis centers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, identified physicians or physicians groups that had significant patient populations suffering renal disease and offered them lucrative opportunities to partner with the firm by acquiring, and/or selling, an interest in dialysis clinics to which their patients would be referred for dialysis treatment. ####  ##### In addition, DaVita entered into secondary agreements with the physicians, including ones in which the physician agreed not to compete with the DaVita clinic, and non-disparagement agreements that would have prevented the physicians from referring their patents to other dialysis providers, the department said in its statement. ####  ##### The settlement resolves charges brought in a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act by a former senior financial analyst in DaVita’s mergers and acquisitions department, David Barbetta. His share of the recovery has not yet been determined, the department said. ####  ##### “Companies seeking to boost profits by paying physician kickbacks for patient referrals — as the government contended in this case — undermine impartial medical judgment at the expense of patients and taxpayers,” said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in the statement. ####  ##### The company said in a statement, “ We have worked incredibly hard to get things right, and it is our belief there was no intentional wrongdoing. ####  ##### “We believe this settlement is the right thing for our teammates, partners and shareholders. It allows us to move forward with heightened clarity and transparency, both with regulators and our physician partners. As part of the settlement, we will undo 11 joint venture transactions covering 26 of our 2,119 clinics.” ####  ##### In July, the department announced the $24.5 million settlement of a whistleblower lawsuit with an Alabama health system and physician group, in which they were charged with violating the False Claims Act by paying or receiving kickbacks in connection with claims to the Medicare program. #### "
"OFF BEAT: 'Simpsons' lawsuit claims cartoon imitates 'Goodfellas' character","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### If gangster “Louie” on “The Simpsons” cartoon reminds you of someone, you’re not alone. ####  ##### Actor Frank Sivero is suing Fox Television Studios Inc., claiming they ripped off the character he developed specifically for the films “Goodfellas” and “The Godfather Part II.” ####  ##### In the lawsuit, filed Oct. 21 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mr. Sivero alleges that the Simpsons’ writers overheard him practicing the character in 1989 while they were living in adjacent apartments. ####  ##### “They knew he was developing the character he was to play in the movie ‘Goodfellas’,” the lawsuit asserts. “In fact, they were aware the entire character of ‘Frankie Carbone’ was created and developed by Sivero, who based his character on his own personality.” ####  ##### In the animated television series, “Louie” is second in command to “Fat Tony,” two Mafioso characters who live in The Simpsons’ hometown of Springfield. ####  ##### Mr. Sivero apparently filed his lawsuit after Gracie Films failed to make good on its promise of making a film with him. ####  ##### The suit states that Gracie Films “never intended to make a film with (Mr.) Sivero, and that they were simply studying him further for the character Louie.” ####  ##### In addition to legal fees and injunctive relief, Mr. Sivero is demanding $250 million in actual damages, including $50 million for the use of his likeness without permission, $100 million for “improper interference,” and $100 million in actual and exemplary damages for the misappropriation of his “confidential” idea. #### "
"Appeals court clears Nationwide of age and race bias charges","Risk Management","Employment Practices, P/C Insurers"," ##### A federal appeals court has overturned a jury verdict and ruled Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. is not liable for age and race discrimination charges in connection with its termination of two sales managers. ####  ##### Both Parker Perret and Melvin Pierre Sr. had worked as sales managers for Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide under the same supervisor, Brian McCulloch, according to Monday’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Parker Perret; Patricia Penn Pierre as executrix of the estate of Melvin Pierre Sr., deceased v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. ####  ##### Mr. McCulloch placed both Mr. Perret and Mr. Pierre on a job coaching plan in November 2009, according to the ruling. In April 2010, Mr. McCulloch notified Mr. Perret that because of his failure to improve in accordance with the coaching plan, he was being placed on a performance improvement plan. Mr. Perret, who testified this was the final stage in Nationwide’s process for terminating employee, resigned in May 2010. ####  ##### Mr. Pierre, who was also placed on an improvement plan around April 2010, almost immediately took medical leave and resigned in July 2010, according to the ruling. ####  ##### The two men filed separate lawsuits that were later combined in U.S. District Court in Sherman, Texas. Mr. Perret claimed age discrimination, while Mr. Pierre, who was black, charged the insurer with both age and race discrimination. Mr. Pierre died after the case was appealed. ####  ##### In a complex resolution, a federal jury found Nationwide had constructively discharged Mr. Perret because of his age and Mr. Pierre because of his age and race. ####  ##### But the court also found that Nationwide proved it would have placed both men on coaching and improvement plans even if it had not considered age or race, which precluded the plaintiffs from receiving monetary damages under Texas law. ####  ##### The District Court denied Nationwide’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, awarded costs to plaintiffs and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees. ####  ##### Both sides appealed the ruling. A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit held there was no evidence to support the two plaintiffs’ discrimination charges. ####  ##### “Plaintiffs contend that Perret and Pierre were pre-selected for termination because of their age and/or race, that Nationwide did not fairly evaluate their compliance with the coaching plans and (improvement plans), and that the result of the coaching plans and (the improvement plan) was intended to be and would inevitably have been termination.” ####  ##### However, said the appeals panel, “There is no evidence of demotion, reassignment, reduction in responsibilities, harassment, or humiliation, and no evidence that any supervisor or manager ever advised plaintiffs to resign or asked them whether they would resign,” said the panel, in reversing the District Court’s denial of Nationwide’s motion for judgment as a matter of law and calling for the case’s dismissal. #### "
"Staples says probing possible payment card data breach","Risk Management",""," ##### (Reuters) — Staples Inc. is investigating a possible breach of payment card data and has contacted law enforcement about the matter, making it the latest U.S. retailer to become a possible victim of a cyber attack. ####  ##### ""Staples is in the process of investigating a potential issue involving credit card data and has contacted law enforcement,"" company spokesman Mark Cautela said in a statement late Monday. ####  ##### The office-supply retailer disclosed the investigation after security reporter Brian Krebs reported on his blog Krebsonsecurity.com that several banks have identified a pattern of payment card fraud suggesting that several Staples stores in northeastern United States had succumbed to a data breach. ####  ##### ""We take the protection of customer information very seriously, and are working to resolve the situation,"" Mr. Cautela said. ####  ##### ""If Staples discovers an issue, it is important to note that customers are not responsible for any fraudulent activity on their credit cards that is reported on a timely basis."" ####  ##### Staples did not provide additional details of the data breach. ####  ##### Earlier this month, Sears Holdings Corp. said it was the victim of a cyber attack that likely resulted in the theft of some customer payment cards at its Kmart stores. ####  ##### Restaurant chain Dairy Queen, owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., also said that it may have compromised payment card information of customers across 46 U.S. states.

Hilliard, W.L. Lyons L.L.C., which conducts business as Hilliard Lyons Asset Management, according to Friday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Jeanne Lee Wallner v. J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons L.O.C. dba Hilliard Lyons Asset Management. ####  ##### In June 2009, Ms. Wallner requested FMLA leave to have knee-replacement surgery. Her physician estimated she would be unable to return to work before Oct. 11, 2009, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Wallner's short-term disability insurer, however, calculated her return-to-work date as Sept. 22, 2009. In mid-September, a human resources manager at the firm told Ms. Wallner she was expected to return to work on that date, and Ms. Wallner unsuccessfully tried to explain to her the difference between FMLA leave and short-term disability, according to the ruling. ####  ##### When Ms. Wallner returned to work on Oct. 1, a colleague started keeping track of when she showed up at work and said she had arrived for work about five minutes late for five days. She was terminated nine days after her return, allegedly in part because of her lateness. ####  ##### Ms. Wallner filed suit against Hilliard Lyons in U.S. District Court in Louisville, Kentucky, charging interference and retaliation under the FMLA; the court granted the firm's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### But in a 2-1 ruling, a 6th Circuit panel reinstated the FMLA retaliation charge. “Even though Wallner lacks direct evidence of discrimination, she has presented circumstantial evidence of retaliation sufficient to forestall summary judgment on her claim,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The opinion said “on the evidence presented by Wallner, a reasonable jury could find the decision to terminate Wallner did not depend upon her tardiness alone,” and that it would be reasonable for a jury to infer her leave “generated ill-will toward her” from her direct supervisor and factored into his decision to terminate her, said the court, in remanding the case to the District Court. ####  ##### The panel did agree with the lower court's dismissal of the FMLA interference claim, stating Ms. Wallner has not demonstrated she was denied a statutory benefit to which she was entitled. ####  ##### In July, a federal court in Seattle refused to dismiss an FMLA violation claim by a Boeing Co. employee who was terminated after she attempted to take FMLA leave for her migraines, stating there is evidence the company discriminated against her. #### "

"Dignity Health hospital system settles whistleblower suit for $37M","Risk Management",""," ##### The San Francisco-based Dignity Health hospital system has agreed to pay $37 million to settle charges in a whistleblower suit that 13 of its hospitals in California, Nevada and Arizona knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare and Tricare by admitting patients who could have been treated on a less costly outpatient basis, the U.S. Department of Justice said. ####  ##### Dignity Health said in a statement there is “widespread confusion” about federal standards for approving coverage of patient admissions. ####  ##### The whistleblower in the case, former Dignity employee Kathleen Hawkins, will receive about $6.25 million of the settlement total, the Department of Justice said Thursday in a statement. ####  ##### The department charged that between 2006 and 2010, the hospitals billed Medicare and Tricare, which is part of the military health care program, for inpatient care for certain patients who underwent elective cardiovascular procedures, such as implanting stents and pacemakers, in scheduled surgeries when the claims should have been billed as lower-cost outpatient surgeries. ####  ##### The government also charged that from 2000 through 2008, four of the hospitals billed Medicare for beneficiaries undergoing elective kyphoplasty procedures, which are minimally invasive and performed to treat certain spinal compression fractures that also should have been billed as less costly outpatient procedures. ####  ##### In addition, the 13 hospitals were charged with admitting patients for certain common medical diagnoses where admissions as an inpatient were medically unnecessary between 2008 through 2010, the department said. ####  ##### As part of the agreement, Dignity, which was previously known as Catholic Healthcare West, entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General that requires the company to engage in significant compliance efforts over the next five years, the department said. ####  ##### “Charging the government for higher-cost inpatient services that patients do not need wastes the country's vital health care dollars,” said Joyce R. Branda, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, in the statement. “This department will continue its work to stop abuses of the nation's health care resources and to ensure patients receive the most appropriate care.” ####  ##### Dignity, which is the fifth-largest hospital system in the nation with 39 hospitals in three states, according to the Department of Justice, said in a statement that because of the confusion about federal standards for approving coverage of patient admissions, “it is often challenging for physicians to ensure their documentation adequately reflects their decision-making in order to comply with complex regulations when making their best medical judgments. Dignity Health is dedicated to providing compassionate, high-quality and affordable health care to the patients and communities we serve.” #### "
"Target not obligated by law to provide defibrillators in stores: Appeals court","Risk Management",""," ##### Target Corp. is not obligated to provide heart defibrillators in its stores, a federal appeals court said after consulting with the California Supreme Court on the issue, though one of its judges said box stores have a “moral obligation” to keep such equipment on hand in case a customer has a heart attack. ####  ##### Mary Ann Verdugo, 49, was shopping in a Pico Rivera, California, Target store in August 2008 when she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and collapsed, according to Michael Verdugo et al. v. Target Corp., filed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. ####  ##### In response to a 911 call, paramedics were dispatched from a nearby fire station, but it took them several minutes to reach the store and a few additional minutes to reach Ms. Verdugo inside the store, by which time it was too late to save her life. The store had no automatic external defibrillator on hand. ####  ##### Ms. Verdugo's brother and mother filed suit against Minneapolis-based Target, charging the retailer breached the duty of care that it owed Ms. Verdugo by failing to have a defibrillator on hand for use in a medical emergency. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Pasadena, California granted Target's motion to dismiss the case, concluding it had no duty to acquire and make available a defibrillator for customers' use. ####  ##### The plaintiffs appealed the ruling to the 9th Circuit, which determined California law did not provide a clear answer to the question of whether Target was required under California law to have a defibrillator in its stores. The appeals court then asked the California Supreme Court to consider the question. ####  ##### In a unanimous ruling in June, the California Supreme Court held that under California law, “Target's common-law duty of care to its customers does not include a duty to acquire and make available” a defibrillator for use in a medical emergency. ####  ##### In its ruling Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit affirmed the U.S. District Court ruling, based on the state Supreme Court's guidance. ####  ##### However, in a separate opinion, Judge Harry Pregerson said he hopes big box stores, including Target, “will, at the very least recognize their moral obligation” to have a heart defibrillator on hand for use in a medical emergency. ####  ##### “Should that not come to pass, I hope that our California legislature takes a hard look at this issue,” he said, observing also that at least one state, Oregon, has enacted a statue that requires big box stores to have a defibrillator on hand. #### "
"Ebola is one of many risk management issues concerning health care executives","Risk Management","Workers Comp Coverage"," ##### ANAHEIM, California — Coping with the threat posed by the Ebola virus is one of many risk management issues on the minds of health care executives. ####  ##### “Get a flu shot,” Richard Umbdenstock, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, advised health care risk managers when dealing with the Ebola threat, noting that its initial symptoms resemble the flu. ####  ##### If “there's a textbook case of the value of risk management and risk managers to their health care organization, it's now,” Mr. Umbdenstock said. “It's a particularly challenging and deadly disease that demands a vigilant adherence to protocols,” and no one in a mobile society can risk ignoring it. ####  ##### Health care organizations must do everything they can to protect patients, staff members and the community, he said during the opening keynote address at the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management's annual conference last month in Anaheim, California. ####  ##### The Ebola virus is among emerging threats in the health care industry for which captives can be a useful tool in helping to insure and manage the risks, others said during the conference. ####  ##### Sarah Pacini, vice president of risk management and insurance at Advocate Health Care in Downers Grove, Illinois, said insurance for health care organizations has started to include exclusions for the Ebola virus. ####  ##### She said health care organizations that use captives might use those alternative risk transfer vehicles to insure Ebola-related liabilities, as well as emerging risks from an increased number of insured patients under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### But Rebecca Havlisch, system vice president of risk management/business health at Banner Health in Phoenix, said health care organizations should consider using captives to insure emerging risks only if they have plans in place to mitigate such issues. ####  ##### “We have to get back to the basics in managing some of these risks,” Ms. Havlisch said. “Ebola is emergency management. Cyber (is) evolving, but we still have to get back to managing them on a day-to-day basis.” ####  ##### Another exposure hospital risk managers must face is preventing violence in hospitals, said Carolyn Coleman, Lehigh Valley Health Network's Allentown, Pennsylvania-based director of risk management, who discussed a March 23, 2013, murder-suicide at the network's Allentown hospital. ####  ##### In discussing lessons learned from the event, Ms. Coleman said one step the hospital system has taken since then is having hospice patients' families answer questionnaires that ask whether there is a gun at home and if other members of the family have been in hospice care. ####  ##### Training hospital staff to make patients say their name and date of birth before a laboratory specimen is taken and refusing to accept improperly labeled specimens also was suggested as a way to reduce diagnostic errors. ####  ##### Health care workers were also warned that while electronic medical records can save money and improve outcomes, incorrectly using them can set up significant liability issues. ####  ##### Marianne DePaulo Plant, a partner at Goodell, Devries, and Leech & Dann L.L.P. in Baltimore, said doctors are not always aware that any medical record changes they make are easily discoverable, yet even the least sophisticated plaintiff attorneys routinely seek the information to prove providers' failure to review the medical records. ####  ##### In addition, medical record templates “give me more heartburn than any other part of electronic records” because of their ability to fill in the wrong information about a patient, said Craig R. Merkle, a partner at Goodell, DeVries. ####  ##### Meanwhile, health care risk managers received the good news that hospitals will not face sharply higher professional liability insurance costs next year, said Erik Johnson, the Raleigh, North Carolina-based director of Aon Risk Solutions' global risk consulting unit. ####  ##### Professional liability claims have been flat, and loss rates are increasing at a modest 2.5% annual rate, which will give health care opportunities “to actually take that flat curve and bend it down” to reduce costs, Mr. Johnson said of the annual study conducted for ASHRM. ####  ##### Nearly 2,000 people attended this year's ASHRM conference Oct. 26 to 29. ####  ##### Next year's conference is scheduled for Oct. 18 to 21, 2015, in Indianapolis. #### "
"Marsh Analytics Platform integrated with global loss database","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, Marsh & McLennan, Tech Insights"," ##### Insurance broker Marsh L.L.C. said it is completing the global rollout of its proprietary analytics solution, Marsh Analytics Platform, which is now fully integrated with its claims database, Global Loss Data Library. ####  ##### The database contains $300 billion in aggregate claims data derived from dozens of countries and more than 20 industries, Marsh said Monday in a statement. The claims data is paired with placement information and analytics technology to deliver a holistic view of current and emerging trends in risk, the company said. ####  ##### By consolidating modeling with a growing loss database, the platform should enable the broker to deliver more effective insights to clients, according to Timothy Gardner, New York-based risk management global leader at Marsh. ####  ##### “We are starting to accumulate a really sizable perspective on global loss activity.” Mr. Gardner said in the statement. “It allows us to take client experience, which tends to be limited, and augment with our own perspective.” ####  ##### Mr. Gardner said the ultimate aim of the platform is to help broaden the conversation with clients from the insurance coverages a client may need in the coming year to more holistic discussions such as how best to align risk with capital. ####  ##### “Our view is that this platform is part of a changing dynamic of how insurance brokers advise their clients,” he said. “It gets us beyond the year-over-year questions of 'what did we pay last year' and instead helps answer more fundamental questions.” ####  ##### Mr. Gardner said one challenge the company has faced in establishing MAP has been training its global team of sales professionals to use the platform. “A big piece for us was rolling this out in a consistent global fashion,” he said. ####  ##### The platform's mobile-based application, known as iMAP, has been helpful in training colleagues around the globe, Mr. Gardner said. ####  ##### “The mobile application that we built allows us to scale the conversation more quickly,” he said. “We can train colleagues quickly, and they are ready to go.” #### "

"Maryland firm to pay $415K to settle EEOC race, gender bias case","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A Maryland environmental remediation services firm has agreed to pay $415,000 to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission race, gender discrimination and harassment lawsuit. ####  ##### The attorney for the firm, Rockville, Maryland-based ACM Services Inc., has denied the charges and said the company settled the case to avoid the cost of litigation. ####  ##### The agency on Friday said ACM had exclusively used word-of-mouth recruitment practices for field laborer positions in order to avoid hiring black job applicants. The EEOC also charged that ACM refused to hire black job applicants or female applicants for field laborer positions. ####  ##### The firm was also charged with subjecting two Hispanic female employees to harassment based on sex, national origin and race, and engaging in unlawful discrimination against them by terminating them when they opposed their treatment. The company was charged with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The settlement provides for $305,000 to be paid to a class of persons not hired or recruited because of race or sex and $110,000 to be paid to the two Hispanic female employees. ####  ##### The three-year consent decree resolving the lawsuit also enjoins ACM from engaging in any future race, sex or national origin discrimination or retaliation, and provides that the company implement numerical goals for hiring qualified black and female applicants, among other provisions. ####  ##### “We are pleased that ACM Services worked with us to resolve this lawsuit quickly and without engaging in protracted litigation,” EEOC Philadelphia regional attorney Debra M. Lawrence said in a statement. “These affirmative measures will benefit all employees and applicants. All employers should consider proactive measures to foster equal employment opportunities for job applicants and workers.” ####  ##### “ACM is very proud of the stellar reputation it has built over many years of hard work,” ACM attorney Jeffrey M. Schwaber, a principal with Stein Sperling Bennett De Jong Driscoll P.C. in Rockville, said in a statement. “It employs a qualified and diverse workforce, and does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.” ####  ##### “ACM denies any wrongdoing, but has a company to run, and after years of back-and-forth discussion with EEOC about this matter, ACM made the difficult decision to settle this case in a manner that avoided the enormous cost and distraction of protracted litigation, and to move on with the work it is set up to do. The matter has been resolved by agreement, and ACM looks forward to continued service and success.” ####  ##### In September, restaurant chain McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurants Inc. agreed to pay $1.3 million to resolve an EEOC-class race discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with refusing to hire African-Americans for front-of-the-house positions at its two Baltimore restaurant locations. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Coffee-injury fib lands would-be claimant in hot water","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### Spilling a false coffee-injury story requires keeping a tight lid on the facts or you might get burned, a California woman has learned. ####  ##### Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville, California, has been charged with fraud for claiming she had been scalded by coffee Jan. 28, 2013, at a McDonald’s drive-thru in Fontana, California, then downloading online photos to try to illustrate that she had suffered second-degree burns on her hand, according to media reports. ####  ##### She faces 21 felony counts of fraud for filing an injury claim in which she said she was handed a cup of coffee at a McDonald's drive-thru with an improperly secured lid that allowed the hot liquid to spill on her hand, the California Department of Insurance said Monday, according to Reuters. She submitted an injury claim with photos from a hospital website of a burned hand she said was her own, and submitted bogus documentation describing treatment she said she received at a hospital, according to the Department of Insurance. ####  ##### The Los Angeles Times reported that Ms. Edwards was seeking $10,000 from her claims. She was charged by the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office, according to the paper. ####  ##### Reuters reports the case against Ms. Edwards comes 20 years after a well-known product liability lawsuit in which Stella Liebeck won a $2.9 million civil judgment in New Mexico over burns she suffered at age 79 from hot coffee she bought at McDonald’s. That judgment was reduced to $480,000, and became the butt of jokes, symbolizing the problem of frivolous lawsuits for many people, Reuters said. ####  ##### But a significant difference between the cases remains: Ms. Liebeck actually suffered her third-degree burns, while California insurance officials say Ms. Edwards, on the other hand, made up her injury claim. ####  ##### “By copying legitimate burn photos from the Internet, Edwards attempted to make a profit from another person’s pain and suffering, and for this she will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement obtained by Reuters. #### "
"Negligence case over cruise line's care of passenger who died reinstated","Risk Management",""," ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated charges of vicarious liability against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in connection with the death of an elderly passenger who was allegedly incompetently treated by ship medical personnel after a fall. ####  ##### Pasquale Vaglio was a passenger aboard Miami-based Royal Caribbean’s cruise ship “Explorer of the Seas” on July 23, 2011, when he fell boarding a trolley at a port-of-call in Bermuda and suffered a severe blow to his head, according to Monday’s ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami in Patricia Franza, as personal representative of the estate of Pasquale F. Vaglio v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., a Liberian corporation. ####  ##### When he was taken to the ship’s infirmary, he was told by a nurse, who did not administer or recommend any diagnostic scans, that he was fine to return to his cabin. ####  ##### After his condition deteriorated, he was seen four hours later for the first time by a shipboard doctor, who ordered Mr. Vaglio transferred to a local hospital, where he arrived another 2½ hours later. ####  ##### “By that time, Vaglio’s life was beyond saving,” said the ruling. Although he was transferred to a hospital in Mineola, New York, the day after his fall, he remained in intensive care until he died a week later. ####  ##### Mr. Vaglio’s daughter, Ms. Franza, filed suit in January 2013 against Royal Caribbean charging it with negligence in connection with her father’s death. The U.S. District Court in Miami dismissed the case in May 2013, citing a 1988 rule stemming from the decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Barbetta v. S/S Bermuda Star. ####  ##### The Barbetta rule immunizes a shipowner from liability whenever a ship’s employees render negligent medical care to its passengers, and “confers this broad immunity no matter how clear the ship owner’s control over its medical staff or how egregious the claimed acts of negligence,” according to the 11th Circuit. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the appellate court reinstated the charges against the cruise line in a unanimous ruling. ####  ##### “Much has changed in the quarter-century since Barbetta,” said the decision. “As we see it, the evolution of legal norms, the rise of a complex cruise industry, and the progression of medical technology have erased whatever utility the Barbetta rule may once have had.” ####  ##### “We thus decline to adopt the Barbetta rule, and find that the complaint in this case plausibly establishes a claim against Royal Caribbean,” said the ruling, in remanding the case for further proceedings. ####  ##### In 2013, the parents of a child who had to undergo emergency brain surgery because of an injury he sustained while playing a ball game during a Royal Caribbean cruise filed suit against the cruise line, charging it with negligence. The case was settled in February 2014 for an undisclosed amount, according to court records. #### "
"Aon tool sorts construction risk profiles for variety of jurisdictions","Risk Management","Employment Practices, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Aon, Construction, Tech Insights"," ##### The construction services group at Aon Risk Solutions has launched a web-based tool to help clients manage the risks posed by working in multiple locations. ####  ##### The Construction Risk Portal comprises a risk map and register, which detail specific construction risk issues in various jurisdictions, while allowing clients to create risk profiles based on contributed data, Aon said in a statement released Tuesday. ####  ##### The risk map, a construction risk reference library, outlines specific risk issues that contribute to a jurisdiction’s overall construction risk rating, including litigation environments, legislation and insurance requirements, according to the statement. ####  ##### Clients can also contribute data to the risk register, which then produces a project- and location-specific risk profile that includes jurisdictional issues, such as state-specific statutes and case law; catastrophic risk exposure, such as windstorms and earthquakes; and a plot of the severity of the risks that may affect a construction project, Aon said in the statement. ####  ##### “As the construction landscape continues to grow, contractors entering new states continually express frustration when confronted with differences in regulation, statutory requirements and hazard risks between geographies,” Construction Services Group Executive Vice President Matt Walsh said in the statement. “The Construction Risk Portal will allow our clients and colleagues to have access 24 hours a day, seven days a week to statutory developments, case law, risk trends and regulatory updates to help facilitate the understanding of these dynamics.” #### "
"Building owners, contractors should be in agreement when buying insurance ","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, Aon, Construction"," ##### NASHVILLE, Tennessee — An emphasis on consensus-building between building owners and general contractors is essential when securing builders risk coverage, speakers said at the International Risk Management Institute Inc.'s 34th Construction Risk Conference. ####  ##### Scott Nissen, Houston-based managing director of the construction services group at Aon Risk Solutions, said building owners and general contractors need to agree on a variety of issues, ranging from which party will pay premiums and deductibles, to which parties will be named insureds, to who buys the coverage. ####  ##### Two important questions deal with “who has the duty to purchase insurance and what exactly needs to be procured,” Mr. Nissen said Monday during a panel discussion at the conference taking place in Nashville, Tennessee. “It's usually the owner, but perhaps 25% of the time the contractor does take over procurement of the insurance.” ####  ##### Fellow panelist Tracy Saxe, New York-based partner at law firm Saxe Doernberger & Vita P.C., said his thinking on who should procure the coverage has evolved. While he once thought that general contractors were best suited to determine their needs under a builders risk policy, he now thinks that building owners are better able to gauge the impact of “soft costs” that need to be covered. ####  ##### As opposed to “hard costs,” which are the amount of money needed to physically repair or replace damaged or destroyed property on a jobsite, soft costs largely result from business interruption. Additional interest expenses and property taxes that still accumulate even if work on a building site stops due to an accident are good examples of soft costs, Mr. Saxe said. ####  ##### “If a general contractor does buy a builders risk policy, it should have the appropriate business interruption, time element and soft-cost coverages,” he said. “But in order to do that, you will need cooperation with the owner from the outset.” ####  ##### Mr. Saxe said efforts by owners and contractors to spend the time upfront to make sure that risks are shared equitably would pay dividends in the end. ####  ##### “You need (to) recognize that you have a common peril,” he said. “If everybody in the project who needs to be covered by a first-party policy is covered, there may be less of a need to point fingers and hire lawyers to figure out who is at fault.” #### "

"OFF BEAT: Cyber villain's process a testament to patience","Risk Management",""," ##### As cyber attacks become increasingly common and sophisticated, it’s easy to imagine James Bond-style supervillains running megacomputers in labyrinthine underground fortresses gleefully attacking our favorite politicians, retailers and sandwich shops. ####  ##### But if one recently jailed European hacker is to be believed, the process is far less complicated and glamorous. ####  ##### The New York Times recently reported on Romanian hacker Marcel-Lehel Lazar, an unemployed 43-year-old Transylvanian who went by the online handle Guccifer. ####  ##### Mr. Lazar is serving a seven-year sentence in a Romanian prison after a two-year spree where he is credited with such acts as hacking the flirty emails of a bikini-wearing Romanian politician sent to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whom he also hacked, the newspaper said. ####  ##### Other Internet exploits revealed private self-portraits painted by President George W.

"RenRe acquisition of Platinum may signal trend in soft reinsurance market","Risk Management","Bermuda, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### While RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.'s $1.9 billion purchase of fellow Bermuda reinsurer Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd. will bear specific fruit for the buyer, the deal is being driven at least in part by overall soft market conditions coupled with an abundance of capital — and may portend further deals. ####  ##### The deal, announced Monday, would see RenRe paying $76 in stock and cash per share of Platinum, a 24% premium to Platinum's closing price of $61.27 on Friday. ####  ##### Platinum's shareholders will get a $10-per-share special dividend, and will be able to choose the rest in the form of $66 in cash or 0.6504 in RenaissanceRe shares or a combination of $35.96 in cash and 0.2960 RenaissanceRe stock. ####  ##### RenRe has expressed interest in enlarging its casualty reinsurance business, and this is an ideal opportunity to do just that, according to analyst Brett Shirreffs, New York-based vice president with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. ####  ##### “This is clearly a sign that they are serious about these intentions, and it's clearly an effort to grow more rapidly in casualty reinsurance than they would have been able to build organically,” said Mr. Shirreffs. ####  ##### Casualty reinsurance represents over half of Platinum's book of business, said Mr. Shirreffs, and the business has been extremely profitable, making it an ideal fit for RenRe's growth plans. ####  ##### Overall market conditions, however, also played a role in the deal. ####  ##### Softening rates and increased competition from abundant sources of alternative capital have “caused RenRe to be more interested in non-property catastrophe business,” said Mr. Shirreffs. Similarly, “Platinum has been forced to shrink as a result of market dynamics,” rendering it a likely takeover candidate, he said. ####  ##### “The organic growth outlook looks soft,” said John L. Ward, CEO of Cincinnatus Partners L.L.C. in Loveland, Ohio, adding that the deal could be a harbinger of things to come. ####  ##### “I think we're going to be seeing some announcements” about further deals, said Mr. Ward, possibly even before the year's end. ####  ##### “The year-end does bring out a lot of deal announcements, so I would not be surprised to see more announcements before year-end, but generally I'm looking at this as maybe a six-to-18-month industry development,” he said. #### "

The action came as several published reports indicated that negotiations between the House and Senate over reauthorization of the program, which will expire Dec. 31 unless extended, had broken down over House negotiators' desire to insert non-insurance related language dealing with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in reauthorization legislation. ####  ##### The ongoing dispute leaves the future of the terrorism backstop in doubt. ####  ##### The new House bill would extend the program for six years and gradually raise the minimum trigger to activate the program to $200 million from the current $100 million. The bill would also create a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers to streamline interstate agency licensing. ####  ##### An earlier version of the bill passed by the House Financial Services Committee but never voted on by the full House would have extended the program for five years while gradually increasing the trigger for most future catastrophic terrorism attacks to $500 million. ####  ##### The Senate approved its own bill, which would extend the program for seven years while leaving the $100 million trigger intact, earlier this year. ####  ##### House and Senate negotiators appeared close to an agreement late last week, raising the possibility that the program would be reauthorized as part of a larger budget bill. #### "

"Corporate culture key to workplace gender equality, diversity: Speakers ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Ace, Chubb, Willis Group"," ##### NEW YORK — As companies formulate strategies for promoting gender equality and diversity in the workplace, it is critical that the programs they put in place to achieve that end match their overall corporate culture, a panel of experts said on Tuesday. ####  ##### At the Cleveland, Ohio-based brokerage Oswald Cos., CEO Robert Klonk has taken a top-down, hands-on approach to providing female professionals at his firm with a clearer path to advancement within the company. ####  ##### “We had a lot of talented and ambitious women in our organization who really didn't have a channel that they could go to and map out a path to a leadership role,” Mr. Klonk said Tuesday during a panel discussion at Business Insurance's 2014 Women to Watch Leadership Conference and Awards in New York. “With many of their help, we formed what we call the Women's Leadership Council in 2013.” ####  ##### Mr. Klonk said the council offers women within the Oswald organization “an outlet to work together and find ways to become leaders both within the organization and among their peer groups.” ####  ##### “It's been great to watch and see internally how a lot of their leadership skills have improved,” he said. ####  ##### Alongside the council's formation, Mr. Klonk said the company also named Janice Tomlinson, a former executive vice president and international field operations manager at Chubb Corp., as its first female board member in the company's 121-year history. ####  ##### “What I've seen at Oswald, and the reason I'm so committed to this is that every member of their leadership teams walks the walk,” Ms. Tomlinson said. “That support from senior leadership is crucially important.” ####  ##### Establishing a dedicated networking, discussion and educational group for female professionals has also proven successful at Philadelphia-based Ace Ltd., according to the company's deputy general counsel, Deborah Giss Stalker. ####  ##### “For me, it's been fascinating to watch the evolution,” Ms. Stalker said during the discussion. “We started with chapters in nine different regions in the U.S., and today's it's grown to more than 20. ####  ##### “It's a safe place for women to talk and network with women inside and out of organization that they'd ordinarily never meet, and it's been a phenomenal platform for bringing them into the view of senior leadership,” she added. ####  ##### Some firms, such as New York-based Willis North America, have expanded their efforts to emphasize and promote diversity beyond the four walls of their own organizations by making a concerted effort to build vendor relationships with women-owned and minority-owned businesses. ####  ##### “From my perspective, it drives both the value proposition and the business case for building diverse teams across the industry,” said Kim Waller, Chicago-based executive vice president at Willis. “Ideally, what we’re doing is partnering with firms that complement us, either by doing something that we don’t do or just doing it differently, which means we’re able to touch the client in a way that may be more hands-on.” ####  ##### Another benefit to partnering with a more diverse range of vendor companies, Ms. Waller said, is that “people begin to learn how to respect each other and hear each other’s voices and ideas.” ####  ##### “The only way to do that is to experience it,” she added. ####  ##### In rarer cases, some firms have found their corporate philosophy and culture to be naturally conducive to women’s advancement through the company’s upper ranks. ####  ##### “Nineteen of our 25 offices are run and managed by female managing partners,” said Steven Testan, founder and senior managing partner at the Van Nuys, California-based Law Offices of Adelson, Testan, Brundo, Novell, and Jimenez. “We haven’t had to create an initiative to make up for a deficiency, because we’ve never had one. We hired the best of the best, and it turned out that women would make up 76% of our managing partners, and 52% of our total lawyer staff.” ####  ##### “It’s been interesting to watch, especially where we’re trying to get men to come in and work under women, because I think it takes a special kind of man to be led by women,” said Karen Stankevitz, director of consulting services at the law firm. “Our organization does look very different, but it’s very supportive organization.” #### "

"Ex-NFL players' case against EA Sports' video game franchise can proceed","Risk Management",""," ##### A federal appeals court has refused to dismiss a case filed by former professional football players against a video game producer over the use of their likenesses, rejecting the producer's argument that the use is protected under the First Amendment. ####  ##### “We are called upon to balance the right of publicity of former professional football players against Electronic Arts' First Amendment right to use their likenesses in its Madden NFL series of video games,” says Tuesday's unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in Michael E. Davis et al. v. Electronic Arts Inc. ####  ##### According to the ruling, each annual version of the game in question, “Madden NFL,” includes all current players for all 32 National Football League teams along with accurate player names, team logos, colors and uniforms, for which Redwood City, California-based Electronic Arts pays annual licensing fees. ####  ##### In addition, however, from 2001 through 2009, the game also included certain particularly successful or popular “historic teams” for which no license was obtained. ####  ##### Although the players on these historic teams were not identified by name or photograph, each is described by his position, years in the NFL, height, weight, skin tone “and relative skill level in different aspects of the sport,” says the ruling. ####  ##### Electronic Arts states “its use of former players' likenesses is protected under the First Amendment as 'incidental use,'” says the ruling. “We disagree. ####  ##### “We hold (Electronic Arts') use of former players is not incidental because it is central to (Electronic Arts') main commercial purpose — to create a realistic virtual simulation of football games involving current and former (National Football League) teams,” says the appeals panel, in upholding a ruling by the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. ####  ##### In a comparable lawsuit in July 2013, a divided 9th Circuit panel ruled against Electronic Arts in a lawsuit filed by former collegiate athletes who accused the company of using their images in video games without permission. #### "

"Insurer CEOs say success depends on smart risk selection","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, FM Global, Hartford Financial, SCOR"," ##### NEW YORK — Increased capacity in the property/casualty market is putting more pressure on insurers and reinsurers, and they will need to adapt their operating strategies in order to succeed, a group of senior executives from across the sector said. ####  ##### Improved risk selection and closer relationships with policyholders and intermediaries should be key concerns as insurers and reinsurers seek to expand profitably, they said late Tuesday during the “CEO Panel” at the Property/Casualty Insurance Joint Industry Forum in New York. ####  ##### With the huge amount of capital in the market “we are going to have to be much smarter in how we choose our risks and where we deploy our capital,” said Henry Klecan Jr., president and CEO of Scor U.S. Corp. in New York. ####  ##### For reinsurers, that means selecting cedents that have infrastructure and technology in place to understand fully their policyholders' business, he said. ####  ##### Risk selection is important for insurers, too, said Christopher J. Swift, chairman and CEO of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. in Hartford, Connecticut. ####  ##### In addition, Hartford is seeking to build stronger relationships with certain agents — particularly in the Midwest — to make the insurer “easier to do business with.” ####  ##### While increased capacity in the property/casualty market is a challenge for insurers, the infrequency of catastrophe losses over the past year has been a boon for property insurers, said Thomas A. Lawson, president and CEO of FM Global in Johnston, Rhode Island. ####  ##### “If you can't make money in large risk property in this environment, you should probably hang it up,” he said. ####  ##### However, there is increased pressure in premium rates, and insurers will need to analyze closely issues such as risk location and loss control to achieve above average results, he said. ####  ##### The annual forum was held by the Insurance Information Institute. #### "

More midsize losses than usual, incentive compensation and severance payments had a negative effect on the combined ratio, a spokesman said Friday in an email. ####  ##### The company said in a statement that it excludes nonrecurring items, such as the “costs associated with defending the unsolicited approach from Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd.,” when calculating operating income, as such items “are not reflective of underlying performance.” Aspen successfully thwarted Endurance’s $3.2 billion hostile takeover bid last year. ####  ##### For all of 2014, net income increased 8.0% to $355.8 million. Yearly net written premiums increased 9.4% to $2.52 billion, while net investment income increased 2.1% to $190.3 million.

"Brokerage buying spree made 2014 a record year for mergers and acquisitions","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### Private equity-backed buyers expanded their ownership of insurance brokerages in 2014, contributing to a record number of announced mergers and acquisitions in the United States and Canada amid strong pricing for sellers. ####  ##### The 357 deals in 2014, 11.2% more than the previous record of 321 M&As in 2012, do not include international acquisitions completed by some of the major U.S. brokers amid companies' ongoing expansion overseas. ####  ##### A mad rush to get deals done to avoid a five percentage point increase in the capital gains tax, which rose to 20% on Jan. 1, 2013, propelled 2012 activity. After M&As slowed as expected in early 2013, the pace has been brisk ever since. ####  ##### Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Hub International Ltd. tied for the largest number of announced deals in 2014, followed by AssuredPartners Inc., Acrisure L.L.C. and BroadStreet Partners Inc. ####  ##### Eight of the 10 most active acquirers completed 10 or ####  ##### more deals during the year; 106 completed only one or two transactions. In all, 128 companies made acquisitions in 2014 vs. 114 in 2013 and 131 in 2012. ####  ##### Led by Hub, AssuredPartners and Acrisure, six private-equity buyers completed more than 10 deals. The private equity-based acquirers closed 44% of deals last year, up from 34% in 2012 and 21% in 2008. Since 2012, 14 of the top 25 acquirers have been brokers backed by private equity funds, furthering their dominant position in the marketplace. ####  ##### The only buyer category showing less activity in 2014 was the bank-owned group, where only 13 announced deals marked the lowest number since 2008. ####  ##### The other categories — publicly traded, privately owned and all other types of buyers — registered increases compared with 2013. ####  ##### Privately owned brokers set a record in 2014 with 113 announced transactions by 75 separate acquirers, only two short of the 2012 high mark of 77. Digital Insurance Inc. led the privately held group with seven deals. ####  ##### Deals closed by public brokers increased from 34 in 2013 to 56 in 2014, a 64% increase but off the 2012 high of 72. ####  ##### Gallagher led the pack among publicly held brokers followed by Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C. and Brown & Brown Inc. Over the past seven years, Gallagher and Marsh & McLennan Agency significantly increased their share of the publicly held broker deals, while Brown & Brown had the largest decline in its number and share of deals. ####  ##### Stand-alone property/casualty brokers continue to be the most sought-after sellers, representing 40% to 45% of total annual transactions. Benefits-only brokers and brokers offering property/casualty and benefits account for another 20% to 25%, with the balance of the deals generally made up of managing general agents, wholesalers and miscellaneous distribution channels. ####  ##### Despite the U.S. health care reform law, the percentage of benefits-only or property/ casualty/benefit agencies being sold has not changed to any significant degree in recent years. ####  ##### Among the largest purchases made in 2014 were Marsh & McLennan Agency's purchase of San Diego-based Barney & Barney L.L.C. and Greensboro, North Carolina-based Senn Dunn Insurance. In addition, Gallagher acquired Toronto-based Noraxis Corp. ####  ##### Looking ahead, the economy has been trending favorable, premiums remain relatively stable albeit with some recent apparent softness, and the near-term outlook is generally for more of the same. ####  ##### There is very strong demand on the buy-side from the private equity-backed and publicly held brokers to attract high-quality sellers. Given the current finite inventory, seller's market pricing prevails with multiples at historically high levels. ####  ##### That said, the natural marketplace forces eventually will shift buyer and seller behavior. Until we reach that point of equilibrium, barring unforeseen economic and/or insurance calamities, we would anticipate this active M&A market to continue. A large number of aging agency principals need to capitalize their value, but only a few are adequately prepared for any type of internal succession. ####  ##### Timothy J. Cunningham and Daniel P.

"Allstate cleared of EEOC retaliation charges","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### An appeals court has reaffirmed dismissal of retaliation charges against Allstate Insurance Co. by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in connection with conversion of its agent workforce to independent contractors. ####  ##### According to Friday’s ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Allstate Insurance Co., the case revolves around a series of moves the insurer made to change the way it sells insurance. ####  ##### In 1990, Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate introduced a program under which all new Allstate agents worked as independent contractors rather than at-will employees, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In November 1999, the insurer also gave 6,200 employee-agents who would be terminated the following year various options, including the opportunity to convert to independent contractor status, upon which they would receive a bonus of at least $5,000, among other benefits. ####  ##### They were required, however, to sign a release of all legal claims against the company. Several agents filed individual and putative class actions against Allstate. ####  ##### They were joined by the EEOC, which filed a civil action of its own, charging the insurer with illegal retaliation because it allowed the agents to continue their careers only if they waived any discrimination claims, according to the ruling. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Philadelphia initially granted summary judgment to Allstate in both cases in 2007, but the 3rd Circuit vacated those rulings in 2009 because they were “inadequately reasoned and insufficiently supported the evidence,” said the appellate court. ####  ##### The case was then remanded and handled by another judge, who consolidated the cases and granted Allstate summary judgment in the EEOC’s retaliation suit. The judge held the conversion option “was not facially retaliatory because the policy did not discriminate on the basis of any protected trait,” the appellate ruling said. ####  ##### The three-judge panel unanimously agreed. ####  ##### “Allstate followed the well-established rule that employers can require terminated employees to waive existing legal claims in order to receive unearned post-termination benefits,” said the appellate panel in upholding the case’s dismissal. ####  ##### “The EEOC has neither given us reason to craft an exception to this rule, nor articulated a valid retaliation claim under the relevant statutes.” #### "

"Soft rockers Hall & Oates play hardball with granola brand","Risk Management","Off Beat"," ##### Daryl Hall and John Oates, whose 1972 debut album featured a canister of oatmeal on the cover, are suing a granola company for naming a product “Haulin’ Oats.” ####  ##### The musical duo, known as Hall & Oates, filed a complaint against Brooklyn-based Early Bird Foods & Co. L.L.C. on Wednesday alleging trademark infringement. ####  ##### The complaint states that Haulin’ Oats is an “obvious play” on Hall & Oates, and that it’s meant “to trade off of the fame and notoriety associated with the artists.” ####  ##### For those who are wondering, Haulin’ Oats includes rolled oats and maple syrup and can be eaten by itself or used “as the base for a breakfast parfait creation,” according to Early Bird Foods’ website. ####  ##### “Over the years, various third parties have attempted to … make a connection between the artists’ names and oats-related products,” the complaint states. “In fact, Daryl Hall and John Oates made this same connection from their inception, as the group’s first full length musical sound recording was entitled ‘Whole Oats.’” ####  ##### “Hall and Oates’ company, Whole Oats Enterprises, owns a Federal Trademark Registration for the identical mark ‘Haulin Oats’ covering breakfast foods that is used in connection with the sale of ‘Haulin Oats’ branded oatmeal by Whole Oats Enterprises’ licensee,” a manager for the artists told media outlets. “Early Bird Foods’ use of the mark on their own products is likely to confuse consumers and lead them to believe that such products are affiliated with or approved by Hall & Oates, which is not the case. Prior attempts to discuss this matter with Early Bird Foods were unsuccessful, and Whole Oats was left with no other choice but to file suit in order to protect its valuable marks and goodwill.” ####  ##### According to a Rolling Stone report, when the magazine asked Early Bird Foods founder Nekisia Davis to comment on the complaint, she replied, “Say it isn’t so,” which also happens to be the name of a 1983 single by Hall & Oates. #### "
"PAM Transport settles EEOC disability bias suit","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### An Arkansas trucking firm has been ordered to pay $477,399 in a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with subjecting its truck-driver workforce to overly broad medical inquires. ####  ##### Tontitown, Arkansas-based PAM Transport Inc.’s medical clearance policy required all drivers to notify the company whenever the driver had any contact with a medical professional, including a routine physical, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the agency said Wednesday in a statement. ####  ##### The agency said that in April 2012, the U.S. District Court in Detroit issued an order mandating the company to change its medical clearance policy to make medical inquiries of drivers only when they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. To help resolve remaining issues, the court appointed a retired judge as a third-party decision-maker. ####  ##### The EEOC said an order entered Feb. 26 requires PAM to pay $225,998 in back pay and interest, $9,114 in compensatory damages and $202,287 in punitive damages to 12 of its former truck drivers. ####  ##### “A punitive damages award almost equal to the other awarded damages reinforces the ADA’s prohibition against impermissible medical inquiries,” said Laurie Young, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Indianapolis district, in a statement ####  ##### The company’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### In September, the EEOC charged a power generation equipment company with violating the ADA by requiring an employee to submit overly broad medical release forms. #### "

"Senate panel takes up cyber insurance issues","Risk Management","P/C Legislation & Regulation, Regulation, Risk Management, Lockton, Zurich, Insurance-linked Securities"," ##### A single federal standard for notifying victims of cyber security breaches is preferable to the current patchwork of state laws, an attorney who is also a professor of insurance law told a Senate panel on Thursday ####  ##### Michael Menapace, counsel in the Hartford, Connecticut, office of Wiggin & Dana L.L.P. and an adjunct professor of law at Hamden, Connecticut-based Quinnipiac University, made that observation as the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security held its first hearing on cyber insurance. ####  ##### Mr. Menapace noted that that current system of 47 state standards plus standards promulgated by the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not uniform in terms of how they are triggered and what information must be contained in them. A uniform standard would reduce the cost of breach responses and enhance consumer protection, he said. ####  ##### The subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said cyber insurance “may be a market-led approach to help businesses improve their cyber security posture by tying policy eligibility or lower premiums to better cyber security practices.” ####  ##### Ben Beeson, the Washington-based vice president for cyber security and privacy with Lockton Cos. L.L.C., agreed, saying the cyber insurance is an important market force that can drive improved cyber security for companies. Mr. Beeson said that Lockton and “we believe the industry as a whole” would welcome the introduction of legislation that would reduce barriers and encourage organizations to share threat indicators with the government and each other while also protecting individual privacy. ####  ##### Catherine Mulligan, senior vice president of the management solutions group at Zurich North America, pointed out that discussions on greater sharing of information between public and private bodies are currently underway. She said that while it's too early to come to any definitive conclusions, the “potential upside” of the discussions is that more comprehensive information will help insurers in developing both coverage and risk management solutions for their policyholders. #### "

"Premera Blue Cross breached, medical information exposed","Risk Management","Health Care Costs, Health Insurers"," ##### (Reuters) — Health insurer Premera Blue Cross said on Tuesday it was a victim of a cyber attack that may have exposed medical data and financial information of 11 million customers in the latest case of a health care company reporting a serious breach. ####  ##### It said the attackers may have gained access to claims data, including clinical information, along with banking account numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data in an attack that began in May 2014 and was uncovered Jan. 29. ####  ##### It is the largest breach reported to date involving patient medical information, according to Dave Kennedy, an expert in healthcare security who is chief executive of TrustedSEC L.L.C. ####  ##### Breaches over the past year at health insurer Anthem Inc. and hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. involved a larger number of records, but those companies said they believe the attackers did not access medical information. ####  ##### Medical records are highly valuable on underground criminal exchanges where stolen data is sold because the information is not only highly confidential, it can also be used to engage in insurance fraud. ####  ##### “Medical records paint a really personal picture of somebody's life and medical procedures,” Mr. Kennedy said. “They allow you to perpetrate really in-depth medical fraud.” ####  ##### The insurer said it has so far uncovered no evidence to show that member data was “used inappropriately.” ####  ##### “We at Premera take this issue seriously and sincerely regret the concern it may cause,” CEO Jeff Roe said in a statement. ####  ##### Premera has set up a hot line to field members' calls and offering free credit monitoring.

Lloyd’s subsequently refunded Mr. Lee’s premium, plus interest, and has asked a New Jersey court to rule that the policy was never applied. ####  ##### Mr. Lee’s lawsuit states he seeks “to make an example of the defendants and in order to deter similar conduct” and says Lloyd’s of London used “repeated delay tactics,” SI.com reports. ####  ##### Mr. Lee gained an unmemorable 422 yards on 37 receptions with one touchdown last season, according to ESPN.com. #### "
"Captive insurers can mitigate political, trade credit risks ","Risk Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Risk Management, Political Risk"," ##### ORLANDO, Fla. — As political and trade credit risk rise in importance to multinational corporations, captives can be used to help mitigate such risks, according to a panel speaking at the Captive Insurance Companies Association conference Monday in Orlando. ####  ##### “Political risk has been in the news” from the Arab Spring three years ago to the more recent tensions between Ukraine and Russia, said Stephen Kay, senior vice president and U.S. practice leader for political risk for Marsh USA Inc. in New York. ####  ##### Mr. Kay said recent surveys show “political risk as one of the key issues that have risen to the attention of the C-suite,” citing a December survey by McKinsey & Co. that named political risk as the No. 1 issue of urgent concern to corporations. ####  ##### Indeed, a live poll conducted while the panel was speaking showed 87.5% of the audience said political risk was greater than a year ago, while only 12.5% saw it as the same and none said it was lower. ####  ##### David Anderson, Washington-based director for global business development for Zurich North America's credit and political risk business, gave two case study examples of how corporations have used a captive structure to help manage political and trade credit risk. ####  ##### In the first, $50 million of trade credit insurance for a commodities trader was secured through a $7 million captive facility together with a separate $43 million Zurich policy, allowing the risk manager to craft a “global financial risk solution” featuring both “diversification of risk” and “arms-length pricing provided by an insurer,” Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### In another example, a global drilling company secured $100 million in political risk insurance with a $10 million captive facility combined with a $90 million reinsurance limit from Zurich, Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### The greatest benefit of captives, said Rod Morris, Fountain Hills, Arizona-based CEO of R&Q Captive Management, is “that it allows risk managers and corporations to take control of their own destiny to a much greater extent” than as a consumer in the marketplace. #### "

"Executive alleges partner said he wanted to 'smack' him against a wall","Risk Management","D&O"," ##### (Reuters) — TPG Capital was sued on Thursday by its former head of public affairs, who accused the private equity giant of ignoring his warnings that the firm may have violated securities regulations and defrauded investors out of millions of dollars as a result. ####  ##### The whistleblower lawsuit, almost without precedent in the tight-knit world of private equity, was filed by Adam Levine, who had been an assistant White House press secretary under President George W. Bush in 2002-2003 and then worked at TPG from 2008 until the end of 2014. Mr. Levine says he was asked to leave the firm by senior executives after he raised concerns about TPG's conduct, according to his lawsuit. ####  ##### TPG, which has $65 billion under management and has, according to the lawsuit, been considering an initial public offering, was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### TPG, co-founded in 1992 by Chairman David Bonderman, sued Mr. Levine in January, accusing him of downloading confidential documents including an internal email about TPG's billing process and leaking them to the media. Mr. Levine said in his lawsuit that allegations he breached confidentiality agreements were false. ####  ##### Mr. Levine's suit alleges that TPG, whose past deals have included the takeovers of Burger King, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the biggest-ever leveraged buyout — the $32 billion takeover of Texas utility TXU — miss-billed expenses, was flouting compliance rules and gave inaccurate information about its investment team. ####  ##### According to the filing in the San Francisco/Oakland division of the U.S. District Court in Northern California, Mr. Levine said he raised concerns that TPG was engaged in practices that he believed ""violated securities laws, rules and regulations"" but was brushed off by its executives. ####  ##### The suit alleges that in response to some of Mr. Levine's concerns, TPG partner and senior counsel Clive Bode said if San Francisco-based Mr. Levine were in the same room as him, he would ""smack"" Mr. Levine's head into a wall and ""knock some f---ing sense"" into him. ####  ##### Mr. Bode also told Mr. Levine he would have ""hunted"" him down and had him ""gutted like a carp"" if Mr. Levine had sent one particular email to Mr. Bode, according to the lawsuit. That email detailing some of Mr. Levine's concerns had gone to other executives. Mr. Bode allegedly also told Mr. Levine that he would ""f---ing kill you"" if Mr. Levine brought ""Bonderman into it."" ####  ##### Mr. Bode could not be immediately reached for comment. ####  ##### Contacted the SEC ####  ##### Mr. Levine has contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission to disclose the alleged violations of regulations at TPG, the suit claims. SEC spokeswoman Florence Harmon said the regulator declined to comment. ####  ##### Mr. Levine is bringing claims under federal and state whistleblower laws, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created a private cause of action for whistleblowers whose employers retaliate against them for lawfully providing information to the SEC. His suit does not specifically address TPG's case against him, which was filed in Texas. ####  ##### The suit also alleges that one TPG fundraiser misrepresented when TPG's Chief Investment Officer Jonathan Coslet started his job to make it seem that his investment record was better than it was, and alleges that TPG billed its portfolio companies with expenses that should have been charged to the business itself. ####  ##### It also claims the firm was planning to expand its public affairs department by billing consultants time to portfolio companies rather than to TPG, which Mr. Levine argued was in breach of SEC regulations. ####  ##### Private equity funds typically raise capital from investors and use that to buy companies. They aim to improve the value of those companies and sell them some years later at a profit. ####  ##### Mr. Coslet could not be immediately reached for comment. ####  ##### Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG claimed in its lawsuit that Mr. Levine referred to himself as a ""weapon of mass destruction"" and someone who could ""bring TPG down in 10 days."" TPG is seeking an injunction requiring Mr. Levine to return any of its confidential documents and electronic devices. ####  ##### Mr. Levine says he was prompted to bring his concerns to TPG management after he attended a speech in May 2014 by Andrew Bowden, a director at the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. In the speech, Mr. Bowden said private equity funds routinely hide fees and overcharge investors. ####  ##### Mr. Bowden said that an examination of advisers by OCIE showed violations of law or material weaknesses in controls over 50% of the time regarding how expenses and fees are handled. One example he highlighted was expenses being shifted to the client without proper disclosure. ####  ##### Mr. Levine claims that bad practices highlighted by Mr. Bowden, such as private equity funds pushing expenses onto portfolio companies — and therefore onto the investors in its funds — when those costs should have been incurred by the management company itself, were ""commonplace"" at TPG. ####  ##### Mr. Levine claims in the lawsuit that he is entitled to up to $738,761 for noncash compensation owed to him, as well as general damages to recompense him for emotional distress. He is also seeking punitive damages. #### "

"Dismissal of Liberty Mutual pregnancy discrimination case upheld ","Risk Management","Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Risk Management, Liberty Mutual"," ##### A U.S. appeals court has affirmed dismissal of a pregnancy discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a former Liberty Mutual Group Inc. sales representative, stating her evidence was insufficient to support her claims. ####  ##### Autumn K. Brown began working as a sales representative for Boston-based Liberty Mutual In 2004, and as a lead sales representative received the assistance of a sales associate, according to last week’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Autumn K. Brown v. Liberty Mutual Group Inc. ####  ##### On Jan. 11, 2011, Ms. Brown told her supervisor, Lynn Peters, that she was pregnant, and Ms. Peters responded she had never had a pregnant person in her office before, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Shortly after, Ms. Peters began to question Ms. Brown’s sales performance and admonished her that she risked losing her sales associate’s assistance if Ms. Brown failed to meet her sales expectations, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Meanwhile, during the first week of January, an auditor who was unaware of Ms. Brown’s pregnancy discovered a number of insurance policies in which the information Ms. Brown entered did not match the information provided by the policyholders, the ruling says. Although meetings were held on the matter, Ms. Brown received no disciplinary action as a result of the audit, the ruling said. ####  ##### In February, Ms. Brown went on a previously scheduled vacation to South Africa. Upon her return, she requested and received short-term disability and medical leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. In April 2011, before the end of her medical leave, she resigned from her position with Liberty Mutual. ####  ##### About a year later, she filed suit against the insurer, stating it had subjected her to pregnancy-based discrimination, a hostile work environment and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as interference with her FMLA rights. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Dallas granted Liberty Mutual summary judgment dismissing the case, and a three-judge appeals court panel unanimously upheld the ruling. ####  ##### “Brown argues that Peters’ exhortations to improve her sales performance and threats to take away her sales associate constituted a constructive discharge by forcing Brown to resign. However, informal criticisms of an employee’s work rarely suffices to support a finding of construction termination,” the appeals panel said. ####  ##### The ruling also states that “neither Peters nor any other employees made any derogatory comments regarding Brown’s pregnancy other than Peters’ initial observation she had not had a pregnant employee before Brown,” and “more importantly, the treatment experienced was not so severe as to create an abusive working environment.” ####  ##### The U.S. Supreme Court has revived a part-time worker’s pregnancy discrimination suit against United Parcel Service Inc., which experts say puts employers on notice that they should review their light-duty programs with respect to pregnant women. #### "

Clayton Spencer as an executive assistant during summer 2012, wrote in her complaint that she was treated differently by Ms. Spencer than her male co-workers were, according to media reports. ####  ##### The lawsuit Ms. Hulbert filed with the Androscoggin County Superior Court on March 6, states that “the president of Bates College expected plaintiff, as a condition of her employment, to engage in activities with the president, such as running, tennis lessons and watching 'chick flicks,' which the president did not require of similarly situated male employees,” according to reports. ####  ##### View the Best Off Beat stories from March. ####  ##### A Bates spokesman told the Lewiston-Auburn Sun Journal that the college denies Ms. Hulbert's claims and expects to fight them. ####  ##### Ms. Hulbert, who said she was terminated on July 11, 2012, is seeking back pay, reinstatement or front pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and other costs and interests, reports state. ####  ##### It wasn't disclosed which chick flicks Ms. Hulbert was allegedly asked to watch with Ms. Spencer. #### "
"Race bias case reinstated of clerk accused of theft, falsely arrested","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a race discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a supermarket clerk, concluding he may have been framed for credit card theft and then falsely arrested after he complained about race discrimination. ####  ##### Sammy Perry, who began working as a night-shift stock clerk at Redner’s Market Inc. in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, in 2003, complained to then-assistant store director Brian Golden in April 2004 that African-American employees were having their hours cut, were being paid less than white employees and were being forced to work on weekends, according to Wednesday’s ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in Kayunta Johnson-Winters v. Redner’s Market Inc. Mr. Perry died in 2014, and the lawsuit was assumed by his daughter. ####  ##### Mr. Perry filed a race discrimination complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission in November 2004 and subsequently claimed he became subject to a pattern of antagonism, according to the ruling. ####  ##### A month later, he was injured at work and was out of work for 1½ years, returning in August 2006. Less than a month later, a woman reported to the local police that her credit card was missing and that she had last used it at the supermarket. The credit card was used at the same store the following day without authorization. ####  ##### The supermarket provided the police with a videotape that showed Mr. Perry at a store cash register 15 minutes after the credit card had been illegally used, according to the ruling. Mr. Perry was arrested for the theft and handcuffed at the store. He was also terminated, although whether it was at that time or subsequently is in dispute. ####  ##### Another store employee subsequently confessed she had used the credit card, and said she was repeatedly pressured by store employees to falsely say Mr. Perry was involved in the theft, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Perry filed suit, charging race discrimination and retaliation. The U.S. District Court in Philadelphia granted Redner’s summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### But a unanimous three-judge appeals panel vacated the summary judgment and remanded the case. “We believe there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether someone at Redner’s purposefully and maliciously identified Perry in connection with the unauthorized transactions,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “The record demonstrates that a reasonable jury could find, contrary to the district court’s ruling, that Redner’s purposefully gave police the wrong video footage so that the police would identify Perry as the perpetrator in an attempt to implicate him in the crime.” ####  ##### The ruling said Mr. Perry has provided “sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the alleged adverse actions were taken against him in retaliation for his previous complaints of race discrimination.” #### "
"Government had no right to take 80% in AIG bailout: Greenberg lawyer ","Risk Management","Regulation, Risk Management, AIG, General liability"," ##### WASHINGTON — The federal government did not have the authority to demand nearly 80% of American International Group Inc.’s equity in return for financial assistance during the 2008 financial crisis, an attorney for AIG investors, including former AIG chief Maurice R. Greenberg, told a federal judge Wednesday. ####  ##### In closing arguments before Judge Thomas Wheeler in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, David Boies said the section of the Federal Reserve Act under which AIG received the first $85 billion of what ultimately amounted to more than $180 billion in federal assistance — all of which has been repaid — never in its 75 years has required equity as compensation in return for financial guarantees, except in the case of AIG. ####  ##### Mr. Boies, who is chairman of law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner L.L.P. in Armonk, New York, said the government made a “political decision” to single out AIG as a scapegoat in the financial crisis. ####  ##### The plaintiffs in Starr International Co. v. United States allege that the government’s actions cost them billions of dollars in lost equity and are seeking to be repaid. ####  ##### The government countered that the plaintiffs suffered no harm. At the time AIG directors agreed to accept the $85 million loan in return for allowing the government to take a 79.9% stake in the company, all involved in the transaction agreed that the loan was preferable to bankruptcy, Justice Department attorney Kenneth Dintzer told Judge Wheeler. ####  ##### If the Federal Reserve, which approved the loan, “had wanted to harm AIG in some way, all it had to do was nothing,” he said, ####  ##### Mr. Dintzer said that without the loan, the value of AIG stock was “zero.” He added that “there never was an entitlement to a loan.” ####  ##### At the conclusion of the closing remarks, Judge Wheeler said “not surprisingly, just about everything in this case is still in dispute” and told the parties that he expected to issue a decision relatively soon. #### "

"Cocktail waitress' hostile work environment suit reinstated","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### An en banc appeals court has reinstated hostile work environment and retaliation charges filed by a terminated cocktail waitress who allegedly had been called a “porch monkey,” holding that a single incident of harassment, if bad enough, can be sufficient to pursue litigation. ####  ##### Reya C. Boyer-Liberto was hired by the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau Hotel in Ocean City, Maryland, in August 2010, according to Thursday's ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in Reya C. Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp. et al. ####  ##### Seven weeks later, in September 2010, Ms. Liberto carried a drink through the kitchen. A manager, Trudi Clubb, confronted her about taking it through the kitchen and calling her a “porch monkey,” Ms. Liberto claims. ####  ##### The next day, when Ms. Liberto went to the management office to report Ms. Clubb's conduct, Ms. Clubb pulled her out of the meeting and allegedly repeated the epithet, stating also, “I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna go” to the hotel owner, Dr. Leonard F. Berger to complain. ####  ##### The owner testified that in light of the racial harassment complaint, he inquired about Ms. Liberto's performance and fired her after receiving a negative evaluation. ####  ##### Ms. Liberto, who is African-American, filed suit in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, charging a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The District Court granted the hotel summary judgment, dismissing the case, an action subsequently affirmed by a divided 4th Circuit panel. ####  ##### The en banc appeals court reinstated both charges in a 12-3 opinion. ####  ##### “A reasonable jury could find that Clubb's two uses of the 'porch monkey' epithet — whether viewed as single incident or as a pair of discrete instances of harassment — were severe enough to engender a hostile work environment,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The court also reinstated the retaliation claim. ####  ##### Pointing to various U.S. Supreme Court rulings, it stated, “An employee is protected from retaliation for opposing an isolated incident of harassment when she reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in progress, with no requirement for additional evidence that a plan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment is likely to occur.” ####  ##### The ruling also said a jury could reject the hostile work environment claims while ruling in favor of the retaliation charge. #### "
"RSA buoyed by net premium boost as low rates, forex bite","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, United Kingdom, Financial Results"," ##### (Reuters) — British insurer RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. posted a 1% year-on-year rise in net written premiums in the first quarter, more than offsetting the impact of adverse interest rate and currency moves, and boosting its shares. ####  ##### The company, which provides personal and commercial general insurance, said it took in a net £1.5 billion ($2.27 billion) of premium income in the three months through March, with operating profit boosted by a series of disposals. ####  ##### Those disposals, including in Singapore and Hong Kong, are part of a recovery plan put in place by Chief Executive Stephen Hester after he was drafted in following an accounting scandal in Ireland and a series of profit warnings. ####  ##### The company, which swung to a profit in 2014, said in a statement on Thursday that net attributable profit was ""a little ahead"" of its plans and included anticipated gains from disposals. ####  ##### Tangible net asset value during the period, funds available to shareholders after intangible assets such as goodwill are stripped out, rose 3% to just shy of £3 billion ($4.54 billion), boosting tangible net asset value per share to 294 pence ($4.45). ####  ##### ""RSA made encouraging progress in Q1. Premium income returned to modest growth. Costs are falling as planned,"" Mr. Hester said in the statement, although ""lower interest rates and currency moves in our key territories continue to have adverse impacts, whilst insurance markets remain competitive."" ####  ##### Shares in RSA rose 2.4% in early dealings against a 0.7% fall in the broader U.K. stock market. ####  ##### Mr. Hester said pricing had held up well in Scandinavia, where market conditions remained relatively stable, while pricing in Canada was more mixed, with improved conditions in personal household insurance offset by weakness elsewhere. ####  ##### In its core U.K. market, meanwhile, pricing remained soft across all major lines of business. ####  ##### The company said foreign exchange movements continued to hit its results, given sterling had risen against all its major currency exposures. ####  ##### Interest rates, meanwhile, had fallen across its major markets, hitting the reinvestment rate on its bond portfolio, although it said it was still on track to deliver £380 million ($575.4 million) of income in 2015. ####  ##### Five-year government debt yields in Sweden and Denmark were down 10 basis points and 30 points, respectively, in the first quarter, while in Canada, yields fell 50 points. ####  ##### The impact of reduced investment income has been raised by other insurers during the current earnings season including Prudential P.L.C., where it contributed to a drop in new business profit. ####  ##### RSA said its preparation for new European solvency rules was on course, and capital ratios were up slightly compared with the year-end, in line with its expectations. #### "

"FAA partners with BNSF Railway, PrecisionHawk on drones","Risk Management","Emerging Risks, Aviation"," ##### (Reuters) — The Federal Aviation Administration announced industry partnerships on Wednesday to test commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's line of sight, seen as a necessary precursor to autonomous drone operations such as package delivery. ####  ##### The partnership include U.S. drone maker PrecisionHawk, which will test applications for surveying crops in rural areas, and BNSF Railway Co., owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which will use drones to inspect rail infrastructure in isolated areas. ####  ##### A third partnership between the FAA and CNN will enable the cable television news network to test newsgathering in urban areas with drones that would remain visible to operators. ####  ##### ""We anticipate receiving valuable data from each of these trials that could result in FAA-approved operations in the next few years,"" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said. ####  ##### ""They will also give insight into how unmanned aircraft can be used to transform the way certain industries do business — whether that means making sure trains run on time, checking on the health of crops, or reporting on a natural disaster."" ####  ##### The news raised the odds that beyond-visual-line-of-sight, or BVLOS, technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years. ####  ##### The proposed FAA rules unveiled in February would lift the current near-ban on commercial drones. But the proposals, as written, still would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by e-commerce company Amazon.com because they require drones to remain within an operator's visual line of sight as a safety measure. #### "

"Black steelworkers certified for promotions bias class action","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Black workers at a South Carolina steel plant are entitled to class certification on their job promotion claims, says a U.S. appeals court in overturning a federal court ruling on the issue for the second time. ####  ##### At the start of the complex litigation in 2004, there were 71 black workers out of a total of 611 employees in the Huger, South Carolina, steel plant operated by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor Corp. and Nucor Steel-Berkeley, but only one black supervisor, according to Monday’s ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in Quinton Brown et al. v. Nucor Corp.; Nucor Steel-Berkeley. ####  ##### Plaintiffs in the case sought class certification for discriminatory job promotion practices and a racially hostile work environment. In 2007, the U.S. District Court in Charleston, South Carolina, denied the workers’ motion for class certification on both charges. In 2009, the 4th Circuit reversed that ruling, calling for certification on both charges. ####  ##### In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a proposed class of about 1.5 million members in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Betty Dukes et al. Citing that ruling, the District Court decertified the job promotions class but not the hostile work environment class. ####  ##### In its ruling Monday, the appeals court once again reinstated the job promotions class certification. ####  ##### The promotions system at the plant “requiring approvals from different levels of management, created an environment in which the discriminatory exercise of discretion by one department head harmed the promotions opportunities for all black workers at the plant by foreclosing on opportunities in that department and generally impeding upward mobility,” said the 63-page majority ruling. It said the District Court had “fundamentally misapprehended the reach of Wal-Mart and its application to the workers’ promotions class.” ####  ##### “At bottom, the workers seek nothing more than the chance to speak with one voice about the promotions discrimination they allegedly suffered as one class on account of one uniting feature: the color of their skin,” said the appeals court in remanding the case to the District Court with instructions to certify the class. #### "

"Alpha coal mine no longer qualifies for cleanup insurance subsidy","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers"," ##### (Reuters) — Alpha Natural Resources Inc. no longer qualifies for a government program that subsidizes a share of mine cleanup insurance, requiring the coal company to find another way to cover roughly $400 million in liabilities, Wyoming officials said on Friday. ####  ##### State officials told Alpha that it has failed financial tests that have allowed the company to defer a share of mine cleanup costs in the case of bankruptcy under a program called ""self bonding."" ####  ##### ""At the end of the day, the rules for self bonding are very clear,"" said Keith Guille, a spokesman for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. ####  ##### Wyoming formally warned Alpha in April that it did not meet self-bond requirements and the company did nothing to change that view in the weeks that followed, Mr. Guille said. ####  ##### Alpha said it disputes the ruling, but is ""investigating a range of options"" to satisfy the regulator that it can cover cleanup costs. ####  ##### The company had earlier warned that losing its right to self bond and the increased costs of surety bonds could weigh on its balance sheet. ####  ##### In April, Reuters reported that the national mine industry regulator was examining the federal self-bond program for abuses. ####  ##### Investors have lately shunned U.S. coal stocks as weak global demand, an abundance of natural gas and costly regulations have hammered the sector. ####  ##### Alpha Natural's shares were down about 4% at 53 cents in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ####  ##### Up to Thursday's close, the stock had fallen nearly 85% in the past 12 months. ####  ##### It would be difficult for cash-strapped mining companies to acquire surety bonds or offer collateral to backstop current reclamation obligations, said Robert Duke, chief counsel for the Surety & Fidelity Association of America. ####  ##### ""Losing the qualification to self bond and turning to the corporate surety market is uncharted territory,"" Mr. Duke said. ####  ##### Friday's news comes a day after a Delaware judge asked Alpha Natural to pay for the legal defense of Donald Blankenship, the former chief executive of its Massey Energy Co. unit who is facing a criminal trial over a coal mining disaster in 2010. #### "

Tamayo said in a statement. “A unanimous eight-person jury believed in Kevin McDowell and rejected Parker Drilling's defense that he posed a 'direct threat' based on safety.” ####  ##### The company said in a statement that it “prides itself on its commitment to equal employment opportunities and to the safety of all personnel and the environments where we work.” ####  ##### The company said it offered a job to the man contingent on a medical exam, and withdrew the offer based on the physician’s opinion that “the claimant could not safely perform the essential job functions of the available rig position.” ####  ##### “While disappointed in the jury’s verdict and the award of damages, Parker is pleased the court recognized Parker Drilling’s commitment to equal employment opportunities and it appreciates the efforts of the court and the jury,” the company said in the statement. ####  ##### In April, an Oklahoma oil drilling company reached a $400,000 settlement with the EEOC in a case in which it was charged with systemic sex discrimination. #### "
"Personal data now prime target for cyber criminals","Risk Management","China"," ##### (Reuters) — Whoever was behind the latest theft of personal data from U.S. government computers appears to be following a new trend set by cyber criminals: targeting increasingly valuable medical records and personnel files. ####  ##### This data, experts say, is worth a lot more to cyber criminals than, say, credit card information. And the Office of Personnel Management breach revealed Thursday suggests cyber spies may now also be finding value in it. ####  ##### Cyber investigators from iSight Partners Inc. said they had linked the OPM hack to earlier thefts of health care records from Anthem Inc., a health insurer, and Premera Blue Cross, a health care services provider. Tens of millions of records may have been lost in those attacks. ####  ##### All three breaches have one thing in common, said John Hultquist of Dallas-based iSight. While cyber espionage usually focuses on stealing commercial or government secrets, these attacks targeted personally identifiable information. ####  ##### The stolen data ""doesn't appear to have been monetized, and the actors seem to have connections to cyber espionage activity"", said Mr. Hultquist, adding that none of the data taken in the earlier attacks had turned up for sale on underground forums. ####  ##### A source close the matter said U.S. authorities were looking into a possible China connection to the breach at OPM, which compromised the personal data of 4 million current and former federal employees. ####  ##### Several U.S. states were already investigating a Chinese link to the Anthem attack in February, a person familiar with the matter has said. ####  ##### China routinely denies involvement in hacking, and on Friday a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing said suggestions it was involved in the OPM breach were ""irresponsible and unscientific."" ####  ##### Mr. Hultquist said iSight could not confirm that China was behind the attacks, but similar methods, servers and habits of the hackers pointed to a single state-sponsored group. ####  ##### Black market flooded ####  ##### Security researchers say medical data and personnel records have become more valuable to cyber criminals than credit card data. ####  ##### The price of stolen credit cards has fallen in online black markets, in part because massive breaches have spiked supply. ####  ##### ""The market has been flooded,"" said Ben Ransford, co-founder of security startup Virta Laboratories Inc. ####  ##### The result: Medical information can be worth 10 times as much as a credit card number. ####  ##### Fraudsters use this data to create fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or they combine a patient number with a false provider number and file made-up claims with insurers. ####  ##### State-sponsored hackers may not be after money, but would also be interested in such data because they could then build a clearer picture of their target. ####  ##### That, said Philip Lieberman of security software company Lieberman Software Inc., would increase the chances of any targeted email attack, or spear phish, successfully obtaining confidential data. ####  ##### Others said that, given the data affected includes job histories, those targets might be in other government departments. ""It's likely this is less about money and more about gaining deeper access to other systems and agencies,"" said Mark Bower of HP Security Voltage, a data security company. ####  ##### This interest in more granular data is pushing hackers of all stripes into more inventive ways of penetrating the defenses of hospitals and other institutions holding such data. ####  ##### TrapX Security, a cyber security company, said it had discovered criminal gangs from Russia and China infecting medical devices such as X-Ray systems and blood gas analyzers to find their way into servers from which they stole personnel and patient data. ####  ##### Other security researchers agreed this kind of attack was becoming more common. ####  ##### Billy Rios, founder of security company Laconicly L.L.C., said he had found infected systems while working with several health care organizations. ""Clinical software is riddled with security vulnerabilities,"" he said. ####  ##### A survey by think-tank The Ponemon Institute L.L.C. issued last month said that more than 90% of health care organizations surveyed had lost data, most of it to hackers. ####  ##### ""This is going to get worse before it gets better,"" said Carl Wright, of TrapX, which discovered the breaches via medical devices. #### "
"EEOC charges bread baking firm with ignoring race bias","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management"," ##### An Illinois bread company has been charged by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with permitting a pattern of disparaging comments against black employees in its Aurora, Illinois, baking facility. ####  ##### The agency said Wednesday that Schaumburg, Illinois-based Gonnella Baking Co., which is being charged with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, did little or nothing to respond to repeated complaints about harassment directed at black employees. ####  ##### The agency said the harassment included frequent and derogatory comments.. ####  ##### “Employers who know about discriminatory harassment of their employees are responsible for stopping it,” said John Hendrickson, the EEOC's regional attorney in Chicago, in a statement. “Racial comments and stereotypes have no place in a modern workplace, and the EEOC will hold employers accountable for that misconduct.” ####  ##### A company spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### In November, a federal district judge entered a $735,000 consent decree resolving a race harassment lawsuit, in which the EEOC charged a Chicago grocery wholesaler with tolerating a racially hostile workplace. #### "

We encourage employers to effectively investigate complaints and recognize color discrimination.” ####  ##### The hotel’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Berkshire most exposed to asbestos losses","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, Berkshire Hathaway, Financial Results, Claims Management"," ##### U.S. property/casualty insurers' asbestos reserves were deficient by $5 billion to $12 billion as of year-end 2014, with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. being most exposed, Fitch Ratings Inc. said in a report issued Tuesday. ####  ##### Industry asbestos reserves now total $22 billion, representing about 4% of industry loss reserves, according to the Chicago-based rating agency's Asbestos Reserves Dashboard: 2015 report. ####  ##### The agency said it has increased its maximum estimate of ultimate industry insured losses for asbestos exposures to $90 billion as of year-end 2014 from a previous estimate of $85 billion. ####  ##### It said incurred losses continue to materialize, tied partly to mesothelioma claims and rising legal defense costs, which have been only partially offset by a reduction in new claims filings. ####  ##### The report said Fitch expects asbestos reserves to continue to “bleed through” insurers' and reinsurers' earnings, rather than “resulting in severe capital shocks.” ####  ##### “Industry practice remains largely to strengthen reserves as claims are paid, thereby keeping reserve levels relatively flat. The earnings drag from asbestos losses for insurers with the greatest exposure has averaged almost 1 percentage point to the group's combined ratio over the past five years,” says the report. ####  ##### Fitch said in its 2014 U.S. Asbestos Liability Dashboard that it estimates U.S. property/casualty industry statutory asbestos reserves to be deficient by $2 billion to $9 billion at year-end 2013. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway has the most asbestos reserves of all companies, with about $14 billion, according to the report. But it has assumed $12 billion of asbestos losses through reinsurance transactions, according to the report. ####  ##### A spokesman for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "

"Financier ordered to pay $18 million in harassment case","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### (Reuters) — A federal jury on Monday ordered the CEO of a Manhattan investment firm to pay $18 million in damages to a former employee for sexual harassment and defamation. ####  ##### Benjamin Wey, who heads up New York Global Group, was accused of using his power to coerce Hanna Bouveng, 25, into having sex, firing her when she refused further advances and then ruining her reputation with a series of offensive blog posts that called her, among other things, a ""street walker."" ####  ##### The two-week civil trial in New York drew lurid headlines from the city's tabloids, pitting a young Swedish woman against a Wall Street financier 20 years her senior. ####  ##### Jurors found in Ms. Bouveng's favor on sexual harassment, retaliation and defamation claims but rejected her allegations of assault and battery. ####  ##### The jury awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and $16 million in punitive damages, mostly for defamation, from Mr. Wey, NYGG and its FNL Media subsidiary. Ms. Bouveng's lawsuit had sought $850 million. ####  ##### Lawyers for Mr. Wey declined to comment on the verdict, saying they would consider his legal options. ####  ##### David Ratner, Ms. Bouveng's lawyer, said she was ""extraordinarily relieved that this ordeal that he has put her through is finally over."" ####  ##### During the trial, Mr. Ratner told jurors that Ms. Bouveng's ""dream"" was to work on Wall Street. He said Mr. Wey conducted a ""relentless campaign"" of harassment after hiring Ms. Bouveng in 2013 to run his firm's marketing efforts, buying her gifts and demanding sexual favors in return. ####  ##### Mr. Wey's actions led to a two-minute sexual encounter in her apartment that left her feeling ""degraded,"" Mr. Ratner said. The two would have sex three more times before Ms. Bouveng rejected further attempts, the lawyer said. ####  ##### In April 2014, Mr. Wey discovered another man in Ms. Bouveng's apartment, which he was helping to finance, and fired her in retaliation, Mr. Ratner said. After she filed the lawsuit, he then wrote a series of disparaging articles in an online publication controlled by FNL Media. ####  ##### Mr. Wey's lawyer, Glenn Colton, countered that the two never had sex and that Ms. Bouveng attempted to extort him after she was fired for substandard work. ####  ##### Ms. Bouveng, Mr. Colton told jurors, torpedoed her career by spending too much time enjoying the city's nightlife and not enough on learning how to do her job. ####  ##### NYGG has access to about $1 billion in investment capital, according to its website. ####  ##### The case is Bouveng v.

"Lloyd's cyber study reveals insurers' aggregation risks ","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Terrorism, Lloyd's of London, Energy"," ##### A coordinated cyber attack on the U.S. power grid could cause large, but manageable, losses of about $21 billion for the insurance industry, according to a study published Wednesday that addresses the risks of aggregation. ####  ##### An attack whereby hackers shut down parts of the grid, leaving 15 U.S. states and Washington without power, could cause economic losses of about $243 million — or as much as $1 trillion in the most extreme scenario — and impact a broad range of insurance coverages, according to the report, “Business Blackout: the insurance implications of a cyber attack on the U.S. power grid” produced by the Centre for Risk Studies at Cambridge University in conjunction with Lloyd's of London. ####  ##### Such an attack, stemming from fires in power generators caused by a cyber attack, likely would impact about 32 lines of insurance, said Andrew Coburn, director of the advisory board of the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies and senior vice president at catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc. in London. ####  ##### The main drivers of insurance losses would be the property damage at the generators themselves, business interruption losses from companies that lose power and contingent business interruption losses for companies that trade with those that lose power. ####  ##### Other major areas of insured losses likely would include incident response costs, fines, liability, perishable contents, household contents and event cancellation, he said. ####  ##### There would be several areas of potential coverage dispute arising from the scenario, Mr. Coburn said, including peril definition and attribution — who caused the loss and why, the territorial distance of limits for insured sites, and deductibles for the duration of the event. ####  ##### The potential losses “are not limited to affirmative cyber coverages,” Mr. Coburn said, and there are areas of ambiguity and “silent coverages” that could potentially be damaging for some insurers. ####  ##### “It is to everyone's advantage to be clear about what is covered and what is not,” he said. ####  ##### Tom Bolt, director of performance management at Lloyd's, said the report had been commissioned, in part, to give Lloyd's greater insight into possible loss aggregations from a major cyber event. ####  ##### “We think we should be insuring cyber, but we think it is incredibly important to understand the aggregation of risk,” said Mr. Bolt, who said that he was worried about how to protect the Lloyd's Central Fund, which covers syndicates that are unable to meet their liabilities, from the actions of a “kid in a bedroom somewhere.” ####  ##### Mr. Bolt urged underwriters and insurance buyers to share information about cyber attacks in order to build up greater knowledge about how to price risks as well as potential aggregation of risk. ####  ##### A cyber attack that affected several industry segments could cause aggregation vulnerabilities and threaten some insurers' solvency, for example, he said. ####  ##### “We want to make sure that is not a risk we take,” he said. #### "

"EEOC charges Wal-Mart over disability bias against worker with bone cancer","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Disability"," ##### The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is charging Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with disability discrimination and harassment for allegedly refusing to set up a chair for an associate suffering from bone cancer. ####  ##### The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said it denies the EEOC's “misleading” charges. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement last week that Wal-Mart initially agreed to comply with a request by Nancy Stack, who worked in its Hodgkins, Illinois, store, that the company provide a chair in her work area in the fitting room and limit her scheduled work hours because treatment for bone cancer in her leg limited her ability to work and stand. ####  ##### But, after complying with her scheduling accommodation for many months, the store revoked it “for no reason,” said the agency, in a statement issued last week. ####  ##### Furthermore, said the agency, the store did not ensure that a chair was in Ms. Stack's work area, “at one point telling her that she had to haul a chair from the furniture department every day, which was of course hard for her to do given her disability.” ####  ##### The EEOC said also that the store then transferred Ms. Stack from the fitting room to a greeter position, which did not comply with her standing restrictions. ####  ##### In addition, it said a co-worker harassed Ms. Stock by calling her names, imitating her limp, and removing or hiding the chair she needed, and that the store took no action in response to her complaints. ####  ##### The EEOC is charging Wal-Mart with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### “It's hard to believe a retailer the size of Wal-Mart could not manage to consistently provide such a simple accommodation as a chair,” said John Hendrickson, regional attorney for EEOC's Chicago district office, in a statement. ####  ##### “Telling a disabled employee that she needs to drag a chair across the store every day is no accommodation at all. Employers have to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so would be an undue hardship. EEOC is aware of no hardship that required Wal-Mart to suddenly change Stack's schedule, deny her the use of a chair, and transfer her out of the fitting room where she had performed her job well for years.” ####  ##### A Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement, “We strongly disagree with the allegations raised in the complaint. Wal-Mart does not condone or tolerate discrimination of any kind, and our company has thousands of associates who perform their jobs with reasonable accommodations that we have provided. ####  ##### “Ms. Stack is a current Wal-Mart associate, and for years we have provided her a reasonable accommodation to assist her in performing essential job duties. We intend to defend the company against the EEOC's misleading claims.” #### "

"United Airlines flight attendant's race bias case reinstated","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### United Airlines Inc. failed to adequately respond to death threats received by a black airline attendant, said an appeals court in overturning a lower court ruling and reinstating her hostile work environment claim. ####  ##### Renee Pryor, who joined Chicago-based United in 1984, discovered a note in her mailbox in the Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, in 2011 claiming to be a hunting license to hunt and kill black people that had a racial epithet and included a hand-drawn image of a person hanging from a pole or tree, according to Wednesday's ruling by the 4th U.S. District Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia in Renee Pryor v. United Air Lines Inc. ####  ##### Despite her complaints to company officials, Ms. Pryor wound up having to file complaints herself with the police and the airline's employee service center, according to the ruling. Eventually, United Airlines conducted an investigation and concluded it could not identify a suspect. ####  ##### Ms. Pryor receiving a subsequent note, and other black airline attendants received similar notes and were subjected to racist rumors and breakroom postings, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Pryor relocated to George Bush International Airport in Houston, where she has not reported any further race-related incidents. ####  ##### In March 2012, Ms. Pryor filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging that United's failure to adequately investigate the rumors and racist notes left in her mailbox constituted unlawful discrimination. ####  ##### After receiving a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Ms. Pryor filed suit in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, charging the airline with race discrimination and a hostile work environment. ####  ##### The District Court dismissed the case, concluding that while Ms. Pryor had been subject to a racially hostile work environment, the airline was not liable for the offensive conduct. ####  ##### The three-judge appeals court panel agreed Ms. Pryor had been subject to a hostile work environment and reinstated the case. ####  ##### “It bears emphasizing that an employer's response need not be perfect, or even embody best practices, to be reasonably calculated to end harassing conduct,” said the ruling. ####  ##### But “a reasonable jury could conclude that the response United actually chose was neither prompt nor reasonably calculated. ####  ##### “Indeed, a reasonable jury could find that United's response was instead reluctant and reactive, intended to minimize any disruption to day-to-day operations instead of identifying a perpetrator and deterring future harassment,” said the appeals panel in reinstating the case. ####  ##### Last year, a U.S. District Judge entered a $735,000 consent decree resolving a race harassment lawsuit, in which the EEOC charged a Chicago grocery wholesaler with tolerating a racially hostile workplace. #### "

"Drone flights present risks, rewards","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Aviation"," ##### The first commercial drone package delivery approved by the Federal Aviation Administration has caught the attention of risk managers, brokers and insurers. ####  ##### Aviation brokers and underwriters see insuring drones as an opportunity, but the latest technology also poses risks such as pilot error and product liability. Risk managers already see drones, the common term for unmanned aerial vehicles, among their top risks. ####  ##### On Friday in Wise County, Virginia, the first FAA-approved drone package delivery service carried medical supplies to a remote medical clinic where volunteers provided medical care to residents in the poverty-stricken area of Appalachia. ####  ##### “Access is a challenge. Some of the people live on top of mountains with no access to medical care. I don't believe people are as aware that we have issues like this in the U.S. They see it in other countries, but it is here as well,” said Rose Mooney, Baltimore, Maryland-based executive director of Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership at Virginia Tech, which co-sponsored the delivery with NASA via the drone that was covered by an undisclosed insurer. ####  ##### “This is opening up a whole new area in the United States,” Ms. Mooney said. “There are a lot of safety and logistical issues that our research at FAA-designated test sites is addressing.” ####  ##### While the FAA recently issued rules for the personal operation of drones, it may be another year or so before it issues rules for commercial drone operators. It has, however, already granted more than 700 exemptions to commercial operators. ####  ##### “These exemptions are granted on a case-by-case basis because there's currently a prohibition on commercial unmanned aerial systems use in the U.S,” said a spokesman for the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International based in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Insurance buyers' interest has soared. ####  ##### “We have seen a 100-fold increase in commercial insurance requests in just over 90 days. We are handling 150 submissions for insurance a week,” said Terry Miller, president of Conifer, Colorado-based Transport Risk Management Inc. ####  ##### The aviation brokerage provides manufacturer, owner and operator coverage for nearly every type of commercial drone, from those that patrol power lines and agricultural fields to those that survey damage after a catastrophe. ####  ##### “We see media looking into it, film news coverage, we are seeing energy and infrastructure looking into drone insurance, real estate companies,” said Patton Kline, Marsh USA Inc.'s New York-based senior vice president of aviation and space. “There is a huge spectrum of companies and industries looking into it because it is more cost-effective to operate (unmanned aerial vehicles) than typical aircraft, and they're looking for insurance at the same time.” ####  ##### Drones are on risk managers' radar as well. ####  ##### In an April survey by the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc., risk managers ranked drones as being among their three top emerging casualty risks, along with cyber security and product recalls. ####  ##### As far as insurance offered to cover commercial drones, Mr. Miller said the coverage includes up to $100 million in third-party liability limits and up to $10 million in hull physical damage limits. With about 2,700 commercial drones insured, there have been about 30 hull physical damage claims, but no liability claims yet, he said. ####  ##### “The insurance policy is a helicopter policy, more or less, but since it does not have an airworthiness certificate, we re-define it as a UAV. We look at aircraft type, aircraft use and the pilot to see if it will be an insurable risk,” Mr. Miller said. “One of the largest causes of crashes has been pilot error,” he said. ####  ##### Marsh's Mr. Kline agrees. ####  ##### “From a liability standpoint, pilot error will remain a risk,” Mr. Kline said. “Underwriters typically have a list of pilot requirements. It's a little bit like typical aviation insurance for pilots; the underwriters want to see something similar for drone pilots.” ####  ##### “We think there will be a fair amount of product liability associated with drone use, and we are working with our clients to avoid that risk,” he said. “A lot of people are focused on the operations, but we are also focused on the product's liability, and we see that as something that should be a concern in the industry.” ####  ##### Should a faulty component cause a drone accident, “it's very easy to go after the operator. But if they don't have deep pockets and if the deep pockets are with the manufacturer, then that is something that should be a concern to people in the business,” Mr. Kline said. ####  ##### However, the unmanned vehicle association argues that drones “could actually reduce liability concerns by making traditionally dangerous tasks, such as bridge, power line and cell tower inspections, safer and more efficient,” the spokesman said. ####  ##### “If a drone is operated properly, it takes out a significant exposure factor,” said Peter Schmitz, New York-based CEO of Aon Risk Solutions' global aviation specialty practice. ####  ##### As the number of drone users increases, so do the incidents of drones being flown into restricted areas, such as over fires or airports, that could put pilots of standard aircraft at risk. ####  ##### From an insurance industry standpoint, Mr. Schmitz feels drones are a good thing “as long as it's not something that gets tarnished by the enthusiastic amateur. That's the issue the FAA is struggling with right now.” #### "
"Ace, XL prepare to address challenges of growth","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Ace, Mergers & Acquisitions, XL Catlin"," ##### Ace Ltd. and XL Group P.L.C., born of the mid-1980s liability crisis, have become successful global players largely through acquisitions, though they face several challenges resulting from their latest purchases. ####  ##### Ace Ltd., formed in 1985, and XL Group P.L.C., originally EXEL Ltd. when established in 1986, began as policyholder-owned facilities to offer excess liability and directors and officers liability coverage. ####  ##### They also helped jumpstart the alternative Bermuda market. ####  ##### Now public companies, both are growing thanks to major acquisitions. ####  ##### Ace earlier this month announced a $28.3 billion deal to buy Chubb Corp. Ace's earlier purchases include Corporate Officers & Directors Assurance Ltd. in 1993; Tempest Reinsurance Co. Ltd. in 1996; and Cigna Corp.'s global property/casualty business in 1999, which gave the insurer an international platform. ####  ##### XL boosted its market share most recently with the $4.28 billion deal in May to acquire Catlin Group Ltd. Earlier purchases include property catastrophe reinsurer GCR Holdings Ltd., the holding company for Global Capital Reinsurance Ltd., in 1997; Mid-Ocean Reinsurance Ltd. in 1998; and Winterthur International in 2001. In 1999, XL merged with NAC Re Corp. ####  ##### Both also have acquired a significant presence at Lloyd's of London. With the purchase of Catlin, XL owns the market's largest syndicate, syndicate 2003 that provides more than 30 lines of coverage. ####  ##### Ace and XL have been largely successful, said Jim Auden, managing director of insurance at Fitch Ratings Inc. in Chicago. ####  ##### When the liability crisis ended, the companies “had very good results and made money and retained that capital, and that allowed them to take advantage of other opportunities down the road,” Mr. Auden said. ####  ##### “They came in without a lot of legacy issues in terms of culture and with fresh management and I think, as a result, they were able to be more nimble” than other insurers, said John Wicher, principal at John A. Wicher & Associates Inc. in San Francisco. “With the appropriate safeguards in place, they have not been afraid to be aggressive and to reach out for growth.” ####  ##### Still, they have stumbled along the way. ####  ##### XL acquired legacy liability exposures with NAC Re and Winterthur that led to more than $1 billion in charges and reserve increases in 2004 and 2005. ####  ##### Ace managed its exposure to past-year liability losses from Cigna's property/casualty business through a then-innovative reinsurance deal with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The deal involved Cigna establishing a separately capitalized runoff entity, which purchased reinsurance from Berkshire. ####  ##### But it ran into trouble when it was one of several insurers caught up in bid-rigging allegations by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the resolution of which cost Ace more than $80 million in various states. ####  ##### In addition to having strong management teams, “each of these companies has demonstrated an ability to maintain a very clear vision in terms of maintaining strong (returns on equity), only doing deals that make sense,” said Robert Hartwig, president of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute Inc. ####  ##### “Even though they stand true to their own vision and they're disciplined, they're still receptive to the risk manager's needs,” said Carolyn Snow, director of risk management at Louisville, Kentucky-based health care provider Humana Inc. ####  ##### Both are “pretty good at paying attention to their customer, making sure the customer does get their claims paid on a timely and accurate basis as needed,” said William M. Zachry, vice president of risk management at grocery store chain Safeway Inc. in Pleasanton, California. ####  ##### Ace and XL have “developed the insight and expertise to write high-exposure, primary business,” said Warren Mula, CEO of Aon Risk Solutions' retail broking unit in Chicago. ####  ##### “When you consider how many carriers are in existence today that truly write primary global property and casualty business, there's not all that many,” he said, saying there are about five to six such insurers. ####  ##### Integrating Chubb and Catlin will be a challenge, but “I think they'll come out fine,” said Safeway's Mr. Zachry. ####  ##### Ace and XL face the complexity of managing operations and risk worldwide, with different regulatory regimes, capital demands and competitive environments, said Alan Murray, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service in New York. ####  ##### “It's easier to be entrepreneurial when you're smaller. When you become bigger, it's more difficult to stay entrepreneurial” and continue to have success, said Rob Yellen, New York-based executive vice president of Finex North America, a unit of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. ####  ##### “Are they going to be able to continue? I think they will,” said Mr. Yellen. While it does not mean there will not be bumps in the road “they're on the right track.” #### "
"Broker M&A deals set record pace in first half","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, Mergers & Acquisitions"," ##### Private equity-backed buyers again dominated mergers and acquisitions of insurance agents and brokers during the record-setting first half of 2015. ####  ##### There were 224 announced transactions in the U.S. and Canada during the first six months of the year, 29% more than the same period last year and 22% higher than the previous six-month record period in the second half of last year. ####  ##### With 110 transactions, private equity-backed buyers accounted for 49% of the total and represented eight of the 10 most active first-half buyers. ####  ##### Privately owned buyers were a distant No. 2 with 61 deals. ####  ##### There were 99 unique buyers in 2015, an increase of more than 20 over the same period in 2014 and 2013, with 11 announcing five or more deals vs. eight during the first half of 2014 and 2013. ####  ##### Private equity-backed firms Acrisure L.L.C., AssuredPartners Inc. and Hub International Ltd. led the first-half buyer list, each with 17 deals. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. was next with 15. BroadStreet Partners Inc. and Confie Seguros Insurance Services each had 11 transactions. ####  ##### Overall, agent and broker M&As have grown steadily since the trough in mid-2013, when quarterly transactions totaled 50 to 60. But over the past eight quarters, four have had more than 90 transactions. And the past three quarters have had more than 100 deals apiece. ####  ##### For the 12-month period ended in June, there were 407 deals announced, a 14% rise over 2014. ####  ##### Each of the buyer groups, except those that are publicly owned, increased their M&A activity during the first half of this year. Private equity-backed firms announced 42 more transactions this year than last year, a 59% increase. The private equity-backed group represented more than 80% of the total year-over-year growth in announced deals. ####  ##### Privately owned agencies also continued their record-setting pace, besting their previous high of 60 acquisitions last year at this time with 61 announced through the first half of this year. But publicly held brokers saw a decline to 26 during the first half of 2015 from 28 transactions in the first half of 2014, primarily due to reduced activity by Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C. ####  ##### Agents and brokers specializing in property/casualty coverage continue to be the primary acquisition targets, with nearly 60% of all deals this year involving them vs. 40% to 45% during 2012-2014. ####  ##### The 224 reported deals this year do not include international acquisitions or recapitalizations by private equity-backed firms. The late June merger of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. and Towers Watson & Co. also is excluded, since Willis is based in London. ####  ##### There also were several changes among private equity players. Most notably, Stone Point Capital L.L.C. took a stake in Alliant Insurance Services Inc., supplanting rival investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. as the largest institutional investor in Alliant; and ABRY Partners invested in The Hilb Group L.L.C., a deal in which BHMS Investments L.P. exited the business. ####  ##### Additionally, several of this year's top 100 brokers of U.S. business were sold this year. They include No. 50 MHBT Inc. and No. 90 J.W. Terrill Inc., which Marsh & McLennan Agency purchased; and No. 86 Cook Maran & Associates Inc., which Prime Risk Partners Inc. bought. ####  ##### Looking to the balance of 2015 and beyond, there will likely be a slowdown in activity and pricing aggressiveness as the overall market returns to some degree of normality, but not yet. ####  ##### Timothy J.

"Hospital firing of tardy nurse justified by lack of FMLA communication","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### A hospital was justified in firing a nurse who was two minutes late for her shift because she had failed to inform her employer she was taking intermittent Family Medical Leave Act leave, says a federal appeals court in upholding dismissal of an FMLA case. ####  ##### Kathleen Norton worked at Bay City, Michigan-based McLaren Bay Special Care, an acute long-term care hospital, for about 17 years, according to Wednesday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Kathleen Norton v. LTCH dba McLaren Bay Special Care et al. ####  ##### In early 2013, Ms. Norton received three written reprimands for excessive absenteeism and tardiness, which was defined as clocking in more than one minute late for a scheduled shift, and understood she risked losing her job if she committed additional infractions, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In May 2013, Ms. Norton began to suffer “vestibular” migraines, experiencing symptoms such as extreme dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, headaches and sensitivity to light, according to the ruling. ####  ##### After her condition prevented her from working for two weeks, she applied for and received intermittent FMLA leave, but was still required to call the hospital's family leave call center at least two hours before her scheduled shift before taking time off. Ms. Norton called the center at least once in June or July, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Norton arrived two minutes late for her July 14 shift without calling the call center in advance and claimed she was unable to anticipate her late arrival, according to the ruling. She said she was suffering from symptoms caused by her condition, but did not discuss this with a manager or human resources representative. ####  ##### At a July 18 meeting, she said she was late because she was waiting for a babysitter to arrive, according to notes taken by a hospital consultant. She was terminated at the end of that meeting. ####  ##### Ms. Norton filed suit, charging the hospital had interfered with the exercise of her FMLA rights and retaliation. The U.S. District Court in Bay City granted the hospital summary judgment dismissing the case, and a three-judge panel unanimously upheld that ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Norton's “silence on and after July 14 deprived (the hospital) of an adequate basis for determining whether the FMLA covered her late arrival,” said the unanimous three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit in dismissing the interference charge. In dismissing the retaliation charge, the ruling said Ms. Norton cannot show that the hospital “applied its attendance and disciplinary policies selectively.” ####  ##### Last year, a federal court refused to dismiss an FMLA violation claim by a Boeing Co. employee who was terminated after she attempted to take FMLA leave for her migraines, stating there is evidence the company discriminated against her. #### "

"Sirius XM will settle unpaid intern lawsuit for $1.3 million","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Sirius XM Radio Inc. has agreed to pay up to $1.3 million to settle claims that it violated U.S. labor laws by not paying interns, making the satellite radio provider the latest large company to settle such a case. ####  ##### Sirius said in court papers filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan that it still believed the unpaid intern program was legal, but that it would pay the money to more than 1,800 former interns to avoid costly litigation. ####  ##### A company representative could not immediately be reached for further comment. A lawyer for the former interns also could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### The plaintiffs, who worked on the Howard Stern Show and other Sirius projects, claimed they worked up to 40 hours per week and were not paid, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York state's minimum wage law. ####  ##### The primary test used by courts in such cases is whether internships were designed primarily to educate young people in a particular field, as opposed to companies using unpaid workers for the same tasks performed by regular employees. ####  ##### The proposed settlement by Sirius, which must be approved by a judge, was announced a month after rulings by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. In cases against Fox Searchlight Pictures Inc. and The Hearst Corp., the appeals court said unpaid internships were legal when they were closely tied to interns' educations. ####  ##### The Fox case, which was filed in 2013, spurred many similar lawsuits. Warner Music Group Corp. in June agreed to pay more than $4.2 million to hundreds of interns, following even larger settlements by Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, Conde Nast and Viacom Inc. #### "

"Ace liable for Abercrombie defense in gift card litigation ","Risk Management","Risk Management, Ace, Claims Disputes, General liability"," ##### An Ace Ltd. unit is obligated to defend retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. in connection with three pending class action lawsuits stemming from a promotion, an appeals court ruled. ####  ##### New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie gave a $25 gift card to customers who had purchased either $75 or $100 worth of goods during the 2009 holiday season, according to Thursday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Ace European Group Ltd. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ####  ##### Although Abercrombie refused to honor the cards after Jan. 30, 2010, some of the gift card had the phrase “no expiration date” printed on the surface, and others had no expiration date. ####  ##### Abercrombie customers filed three class action lawsuits still pending in Illinois, California and Ohio claiming customer fraud stemming from the retailer's refusal to honor the cards and breach of contract. ####  ##### Abercrombie, which had purchased an “advertisers and Internet liability” policy from Ace unit Ace European Group Ltd. in September 2009, requested that the insurer defend it in the litigation, but the insurer refused, stating the subject matter fell outside its policy's coverage. ####  ##### Abercrombie sued Ace for breach of contract and related claims, while Ace sought a declaratory judgment stating it was not obligated to provide coverage. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, ruled the insurer was obligated for defense costs, and the 6th Circuit's three-judge appellate panel agreed in a unanimous ruling. ####  ##### According to the appellate ruling, Ace argued it has no duty to defend Abercrombie under two exclusions in its policy. ####  ##### The first exclusion said the insurer has no liability assumed under any contract or agreement, including any breach or express warranty or guarantee. That exclusion is not applicable, said the panel. “Under Ohio law, contracts are legally enforceable agreements consisting of — among other things — offer, acceptance and consideration … Under this definition, we do not understand the promotional gift cards to be 'contracts' within the meaning” of the exclusion. ####  ##### The second policy exclusion, for “coupons, prize discounts, prizes, awards or any other valuable considerations” also does not apply, said the panel. “Ace neither shows that the plain and ordinary meaning of 'coupon' embraces the promotional gift cards nor justifies looking beyond the policy's plain language,” said the ruling. ####  ##### As a result, the exclusion “does not relieve Ace of its duty to defend,” said the panel, in affirming the lower court's ruling. #### "
"Bumble Bee pays record settlement in death of worker trapped in oven ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### Bumble Bee Foods L.L.C. will pay $6 million for workplace safety violations that caused the death of an employee trapped inside an industrial oven, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced Wednesday. ####  ##### The San Diego, California-based food producer will pay $1.5 million in restitution to the family of Jose Melena, who was killed in October 2012 at the company's Santa Fe Springs, California, plant, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. Mr. Melena was stuck in the back of an industrial oven after his coworkers loaded 12,000 pounds of canned tuna, unaware he was inside the oven. ####  ##### The company will spend $3 million to replace all of its outdated tuna ovens with new, automated ovens and has pledged not to require workers to enter the super-heated, pressurized steam cookers. Bumble Bee must also implement enhanced safety measures such as installing video cameras at their ovens, train managers and workers about safety rules and conduct safety audits of its plant equipment. ####  ##### Another $1.5 million will reimburse investigators for the costs of the criminal inquiry and pay for court costs, fines and penalties, the statement said. ####  ##### The settlement is the largest known payout in a California criminal prosecution of workplace safety violations involving a single victim and requires the company to make a public statement conceding guilt, according to the statement. ####  ##### “Bumble Bee has reached a settlement with the Los Angeles District Attorney's office related to the tragic accident that occurred at our Santa Fe Springs plant in October 2012,” the company said in a statement. “While this resolution will help bring closure with the district attorney's office, we will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities.” ####  ##### Angel Rodriguez of Riverside, California, Bumble Bee's director of plant operations, was charged in the case. He agreed in a plea bargain to perform 320 hours of community service, pay about $11,400 and take classes on lockout tagout and confined-space rules, which are procedures designed to disable machinery or equipment and protect workers from the release of hazardous energy, the district attorney's statement said. ####  ##### Saul Florez, Bumble Bee's former safety manager from Whittier, California, pleaded guilty to a felony count of willfully violating lockout tagout rules and proximately causing Mr. Melena's death. He was sentenced to three years of formal probation, ordered to complete 30 days of community labor, pay $19,000 and also take safety classes. #### "

Over time, however, laparotomy became a less common surgical technique as laparoscopic surgery, which is perceived to have several advantages for the patient, came into favor. ####  ##### The Justice Department charged that Genzyme sales representatives then taught surgeons and other medical staff how to use Seprafilm in laparoscopic procedures, for which it was not approved and which resulted in it becoming adulterated, according to the criminal charges. ####  ##### “Today's action demonstrates that the Department of Justice will evaluate the facts of each case and choose the most appropriate tool of the several available to it to best address criminal misconduct,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C.

"EEOC case over restaurant's mandatory arbitration policy can proceed ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### A federal judge has refused to dismiss a claim filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against a restaurant chain over the issue of its requirement that job applicants sign mandatory arbitration agreements. ####  ##### The firm's attorney said the company, Allendale, New Jersey-based Doherty Enterprises Inc., has not violated the law, and that it expects to prevail in the dispute. ####  ##### The EEOC said Tuesday that Doherty, which owns and operates more than 140 franchise restaurants, including Applebee's and Panera Bread, throughout Florida, Georgia, New Jersey and New York, required prospective employees to sign mandatory arbitration agreements in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The agency filed a lawsuit against the chain in the U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September 2014. The court refused to dismiss the case against Doherty, which had argued the EEOC's lawsuit could not proceed because it was not premised upon a discrimination charge, and because the EEOC had not engaged in presuit conciliation, which is required under other sections of the statute, the EEOC said in a statement. ####  ##### The EEOC said the court found that the section of Title VII in question, Section 707, permits the EEOC to seek immediate relief without the same presuit administrative process that is required under another section of Title VII. ####  ##### It also rejected Doherty's argument that the EEOC is limited to claims of discrimination and retaliation under Section 707. ####  ##### Title VII's Section 707 says actions can be filed against firms when there is “reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment” of rights protected by Title VII. ####  ##### “The court's order recognizes EEOC's critical role in eradicating employment discrimination,” Robert E. Weisberg, Miami-based EEOC regional attorney, said in a statement. ####  ##### “Employers cannot immunize themselves from federal oversight by prohibiting employees from filing discrimination charges and communicating with EEOC. As the court held, Title VII gives the agency the authority to take immediate action to challenge the use of these types of overly broad arbitration agreements,” Mr. Weisberg said. ####  ##### “Doherty is confident that further proceedings will reveal the flaws in the EEOC's position that the arbitration agreement does not violate Title VII no matter how the agency frames its arguments,” Doherty's attorney, Dena B. Calo a partner with Saul Ewing L.L.P. in Princeton, New Jersey, said in a statement. “Doherty continues to believe that the case has no merit and will vigorously defend against it.” #### "

"Kmart pays $1.4 million to settle Medicare inducement charges","Risk Management","D&O"," ##### (Reuters) — Kmart Corp. has paid $1.4 million to settle allegations that it violated the federal False Claims Act by inducing Medicare beneficiaries to fill prescriptions at its pharmacies, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday. ####  ##### The government said the accord resolves allegations that Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings Corp., let beneficiaries use drug manufacturers' coupons to reduce or eliminate prescription copayments. ####  ##### It said this caused people to seek out brand-name drugs rather than cheaper generics, boosting the government's costs. ####  ##### Kmart was also accused of improperly offering discounts on gasoline purchases at participating gas stations based on the number of prescriptions filled. ####  ##### The government said Kmart's improper activity lasted from June 2011 to June 2014, and violated a federal prohibition against offering benefits to Medicare beneficiaries to influence their decisions about which pharmacies to use. ####  ##### Tuesday's settlement resolved claims first brought in a 2013 whistleblower lawsuit by Joshua Leighr, a former Kmart pharmacist from Kansas City, Missouri. He will receive about $248,500 of the payout, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### Kmart has about 780 in-store pharmacies, and settled without any determination of liability, the Justice Department said ####  ##### Howard Riefs, a Sears spokesman, declined to comment.

"'Mark of the Beast' case puts spotlight on religious accommodation ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability"," ##### A U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission case in which a mining worker was awarded $586,860 for allegedly being forced to retire because he refused to use a biometric hand scanner for religious reasons, saying it related to the “Mark of the Beast,” should serve as a warning to employers to take religious accommodation requests seriously, attorneys say. ####  ##### Beverly R. Butcher Jr. had worked as a laborer for Consolidation Coal Co., a unit of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Consol Energy Inc., for more than 35 years when the company began requiring workers to use a newly installed biometric hand scanner to track employee time and attendance, the EEOC said last week in a statement. ####  ##### Mr. Butcher repeatedly informed company officials that submitting to biometric hand scanning violated his religious beliefs as an evangelical Christian. ####  ##### He also wrote a letter to company officials explaining about the relationship between hand-scanning technology and the “Mark of the Beast” and the Antichrist discussed in the New Testament's Book of Revelation, and said he required an exemption from hand scanning based on his religious beliefs, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### Consolidation and Consol refused to consider alternative means of tracking Mr. Butcher's time and attendance, however, and Mr. Butcher was forced to retire, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The EEOC filed suit on Mr. Butcher's behalf, charging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In January, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Clarksburg, West Virginia, awarded Mr. Butcher $150,000 in compensatory damages. ####  ##### Last week, the court awarded Mr. Butcher an additional $436,861 in wages for the Title VII violations found by the jury. The court also ordered a permanent injunction for a three-year period barring the defendants from denying reasonable accommodations for religion in connection with their use of biometric hand scanning, and required them to be trained on religious accommodations under Title VII. ####  ##### “I am very pleased with the final outcome in this case, which is the latest in a series of cases involving Title VII's prohibition against religious discrimination,” said EEOC general counsel David Lopez in a statement. “This victory underscores two important American values: religious freedom and inclusiveness.” ####  ##### St. Clairsville, Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp., which acquired Consolidation Coal in 2013, said in a statement, “The record is clear that Mr. Butcher failed to follow the contractually required dispute resolution procedures. Further, Consolidation Coal Company made a reasonable accommodation for his religious beliefs and never discriminated against Mr. Butcher. We strongly disagree with the decision and will immediately appeal.” ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, Mark Fijman, counsel at law firm Phelps Dunbar L.L.P. in Jackson, Mississippi, said the case “highlights how aggressively the EEOC is pursuing religious discrimination cases, and it should serve as a wakeup call to employers, especially in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in Abercrombie & Fitch.” ####  ##### In its ruling in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the Supreme Court held that employers must consider whether a job applicant needs an accommodation based on religious needs, even if the applicant does not mention the subject. ####  ##### The Abercrombie case “put a heightened standard on employers if they suspect there is a religious accommodation” that is required, Mr. Fijman said. “They have to take a step further than previous courts would call for,” so employers “have to be very proactive in these cases,” he said. ####  ##### Mark S. Kittaka, a partner with law firm Barnes & Thornburg L.L.P. in Fort Wayne, Indiana, said, “Employers need to take seriously any employee's request for reasonable accommodation, regardless of whether they think it seems outrageous or not,” because it has become a “significant point” of emphasis by the EEOC. #### "

"Senators ask automakers for cyber security details","Risk Management","Regulation, Auto liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Two U.S. senators have asked the world's biggest automakers for information on steps they have taken to protect cars from being hacked, as attention on vehicle security has surged following the first car recall over a cyber bug. ####  ##### Sens. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., wrote to 18 automakers on Wednesday asking about efforts taken to secure vehicles including 2015 and 2106 models. They asked automakers how they test electronic components and communications systems to ensure attackers cannot gain access to onboard networks. ####  ##### Concerns about auto cyber security have grown since July, when researchers gained remote control of a moving Jeep, prompting Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to recall some 1.4 million vehicles for a software update. ####  ##### The request from the senators follows a review that Sen. Markey began in December 2013. He concluded in a February 2015 report that the spread of technology connecting vehicles to networks had outpaced industry and government efforts to protect vehicles from hackers. ####  ##### The senators said they want to know what automakers have done since the last survey to beef up security. ####  ##### Modern cars typically have dozens of small computers that connect to multiple external networks, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks similar to ones waged on traditional computer systems. Researchers have said attackers could put lives at risk if they can gain remote control of key vehicle systems such as steering and acceleration. ####  ##### ""As vehicles become increasingly connected to the Internet, and to one another through advanced features and services, we continue to see how these technologies present vulnerabilities that can compromise the safety and privacy of drivers and passengers,"" the senators' letter said. ####  ##### They added that the industry has made some progress in recent years. ""We appreciate that many automotive companies have begun to take concrete steps to close these security gaps."" ####  ##### Letter recipients included BMW Group, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Co. and Volkswagen A.G. ####  ##### Security experts have said it will take years for carmakers to plug security holes, because they have been adding computers to vehicles for two decades but only recently started seriously looking for security bugs. ####  ##### ""They've been trying to fix the problems, but it takes a long time,"" Chris Rouland, founder and chief technology officer of cyber security firm Bastille, said in a Reuters.com video on car hacking. #### "
"Insurers not liable to cover Urban Outfitters in ZIP code lawsuits","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers"," ##### Insurers are not obligated to provide defense coverage to Urban Outfitters Inc. for litigation in connection with its allegedly inappropriate collection of ZIP code information, based on their policies’ language, an appeals court ruled. ####  ##### Philadelphia-based Urban Outfitters Inc. and its Anthropologie Inc. subsidiary have been sued in three putative class action lawsuits related to the collection of  ZIP code data, according to Tuesday’s ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in OneBeacon America Insurance Co. v. Urban Outfitters Inc.; Anthropologie Inc. v. Hanover Insurance Group. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit unanimously upheld dismissal of the case in May 2014 by the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia based on the language of the policies issued by OneBeacon America, a unit of Hamilton, Bermuda-based OneBeacon Insurance Group Ltd., and by Worcester, Massachusetts-based Hanover Insurance Group Inc. ####  ##### For instance, in the first underlying case, filed in 2013 in the District of Columbia, plaintiffs alleged that Urban Outfitters’ request for  ZIP code information when customers made a credit card purchase violated the District of Columbia statute. ####  ##### The appeals court agreed with the lower court that the insurers’ policy provided coverage for “personal and advertising injury” arising out of publication. Urban Outfitters’ actions, “do not constitute ‘publication’ within the policies’ definition of ‘personal and advertising injury,’” said the ruling. ####  ##### The appeals court also upheld dismissal of the two other actions, based on the insurers’ policy language, one of which was filed in state court in San Diego, with the other now in U.S. District Court in Boston. #### "

"Ex-hacker: Act on assumption nothing is safe","Risk Management","Risk Management, Emerging Risks, 2015 Cyber Risk Summit"," ##### SAN FRANCISCO — During the Industrial Age, there was a simplicity to the repetition of small tasks, but in today's Information Age, complexity drives progress, an ex-hacker told attendees at Business Insurance's 2015 Cyber Risk Summit in San Francisco. ####  ##### “Complexity grew over the years of the Information Age, and now, specialization is the key to progress,” Jeff Moss, a former hacker also known as The Dark Tangent, said Monday. “And 10 years from now, we will be even more specialized, but this will lead to complexity with systems that fail in unpredictable ways.” ####  ##### Mr. Moss, also is a member of several key organizations involving cyber risk mitigation, including the Homeland Security Advisory Council. ####  ##### How any system will fail is impossible to predict, he said. “Just assume it will fail, for your own well-being, so you can sleep,” he said. ####  ##### Hackers, according to Mr. Moss, are categorized into four groups: nation states who want secrets, organized criminals who want money, protestors who want attention and researchers who want knowledge. ####  ##### A common type of cyber attack used by hackers is a distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack, where a DoS attack compromises multiple systems to target a single system and cause a denial of service, by locking the data. These attacks are getting worse year by year, Mr. Moss said, and there is no known way to keep data safe. ####  ##### Even physical keys used to lock data can be photographed by thieves and hackers and then replicated by using a 3-D printer. The only safe physical key available at this time is EVVA MCS, which uses magnets on both sides of the keys so hackers can't tell the orientation of the magnets. Mr. Moss said he uses these types of keys for his home. ####  ##### As technology manufacturers continue to build devices that store and have the ability to update their data, nobody has given thought to the problem of being able to manage and upgrade their systems once they are made vulnerable, he said. ####  ##### “Encrypted police radios, mobile phones, GPS, Web browsers, alarms and access control systems, satellite phones and pagers — none of these are safe,” he told the conference. ####  ##### “Eventually, a software-enabled toaster will burn down a house, and this is where software liability will begin, but right now the only software liability is the price of the software,” Mr. Moss said. ####  ##### In the meantime, people need to be responsible for their own security, he recommended. ####  ##### “You need to have a holistic approach; have a knowledgeable team that will understand the technology, a life cycle management of prevent-detect-respond, senior leadership to buy in and have ownership of protecting the company and, finally, do what you can when you can,” he said. #### "
"Appeals court draws clearer line between interns, gofers ","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Employers still using unpaid interns for nontraining-related tasks may have to reconsider doing so in light of the most recent appeals court ruling on the issue. ####  ##### Observers also say the ruling on unpaid interns by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta in Bill Schumann et al. v. Collier Anesthesia P.A., is a victory for employers because it supports an earlier appeals court ruling that rejects the U.S. Department of Labor's standard for determining when an intern can be unpaid. ####  ##### They say the ruling is also likely to be influential with other courts. ####  ##### Plaintiffs in Schumann were 25 former registered nurse anesthetist students who attended a master's degree program at Wolford College L.LC. In Naples, Florida, with the goal of becoming certified registered nurse anesthetists. During their study, the students participated in a clinical curriculum required to obtain their master's degrees under Florida law, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Students were seeking in the litigation to recover unpaid wages and overtime they claimed they were due under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The U.S. District Court in Fort Myers, Florida, granted the defendants summary judgment dismissing the case on the basis the students were not employees under the act. ####  ##### According to the 11th Circuit's Sept. 11 ruling, in guidance based on a 1947 U.S. Supreme Court case involving railroad brakemen, Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., the Labor Department has said trainees and students are not employees within the meaning of the FLSA only if all of six criteria are met. These are: ####  ##### • The training involves actual operation of the employer's facilities ####  ##### • It is for the benefit of the trainees ####  ##### • The trainees do not displace regular employees ####  ##### • The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the trainees' activities ####  ##### • The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the end of the training period ####  ##### • The trainees understand they are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training ####  ##### However, says the unanimous ruling of the 11th Circuit's three-judge panel, “We do not defer to this test because, with all due respect to the DOL and the important work it does, we do not find it persuasive.” ####  ##### Since that 1947 ruling, says the 11th Circuit, courts have “for the most part, concentrated on evaluating the 'primary beneficiary' ” of the training or school program to determine whether the participants are employees. ####  ##### As the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York observed on July 2 in its  ruling in Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures Inc., the facts of the 1947 case “do not necessarily 'reflect the role of internships in today's economy…' ” said the 11th Circuit. ####  ##### “Longer-term, intensive modern internships that are required to obtain academic degrees and professional certification and licensure in a field are just too different from the short training classes offered by the railroading Portland Terminal for the purpose of creating its own labor pool,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The ruling cites the “non-exhaustive set of considerations” for evaluating the “primary beneficiary” in cases involving modern internships described by the 2nd Circuit in its ruling. These are the extent to which: ####  ##### • Intern and employer understand there is no expectation of compensation ####  ##### • The training is similar to what would be provided in an educational environment ####  ##### • The internship accommodates the intern's academic commitments ####  ##### • The internship is limited to the period in which it provides beneficial learning ####  ##### • The intern's work complements, rather than displaces, paid employees ####  ##### • Intern and employer understand the internships are being conducted without entitlement of a paid job at the internship's end ####  ##### The case was remanded to the District Court to consider these factors. ####  ##### The takeaway ####  ##### “The test that the Department of Labor continues to use requires that an internship program meet all the factors in order to be considered a bona fide (internship) relationship,” said William R. Pokorny, a partner with law firm Franczek Radelet P.C. in Chicago. ####  ##### “The test that the 11th Circuit adopted in this new decision makes it clear that the factors are only a guide for the court and that the presence or absence of only one those factors is not necessarily dispositive,” Mr. Pokorny said. “And the court's ruling makes it clear that although internship programs may not meet all of the factors in the Department of Labor test, in the court's view, many of those internship programs are still properly considered internships rather than employment relationships.” ####  ##### The ruling reaffirms that employers are mistaken if they are “acting under the misconception that they can use the services of unpaid interns for routine job-related tasks and not pay them,” said Jonathan T. Hyman, a partner with law firm Meyers, Roman, Friedberg & Lewis in Cleveland. ####  ##### The days of using unpaid interns “for just about anything other than bona fide educational training” are about ended, he said ####  ##### Mr. Hyman said the ruling is potentially influential because it is the first case since the Department of Labor began looking at this issue “where you actually had coursework,” unlike the Fox case, where interns were making coffee. “This is more of what you would think of as a traditional internship,” he said. ####  ##### He said he hopes the District Court will decide that because the internship was part of a course, “the individuals were the primary beneficiaries, and therefore were not employees under the FLSA.” ####  ##### With this ruling, along with the 2nd Circuit ruling, “you have another nail in the coffin of the Department of Labor trying to overreach and assert that persons are employees when they are indeed not employees. In these cases, they are more appropriately students,” said Evan J. Spelfogel, a partner with Epstein Becker & Green P.C. in New York. ####  ##### Mr. Spelfogel pointed to Labor Department guidance issued in July on classifying workers as employee versus independent contractors, which emphasizes the alleged misclassification of many workers as independent contractors. #### "
"Plumbing contractor to pay for forcing out employees at age 62","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Construction"," ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reached a $140,000 settlement with a heating and plumbing contractor who allegedly fired two long-time employees when they reached age 62, and had also retaliated against one of the workers for resisting its plans. ####  ##### The attorney for the company, Superior, Wisconsin-based Stack Brothers Mechanical Contractors Inc., said Monday in a statement that the owner had planned to terminate both workers several years ago, but only kept them on until age 62 so they would be eligible for Social Security. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement issued Friday that Superior, Wisconsin-based Stack Brothers Mechanical Contractors Inc., a major heating and plumbing contractor in northern Wisconsin and northern Minnesota, had fired Randy Virta, a 16-year employee, and Karen Kolodzeske, a 25-year employee, although the company’s owner had been warned by the employees that this was illegal. ####  ##### The EEOC said also that after firing Mr. Virta, the owner retaliated against Ms. Kolodzeske for her complaints about being fired at age 62 by denying her a raise, suspending her without pay for two days and creating a hostile work environment while waiting for her to turn 62 before firing her as well. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement agreement, Stack Brothers will pay $95,000 to Mr. Virta and $35,000 to Ms. Kolodzeske, plus $10,000 of their attorney’s fees, and train its managers and employees regarding employer obligations under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1987. ####  ##### “Employers often speak about how valuable loyalty in the workplace is,” said EEOC Chicago regional attorney John C. Hendrickson, in a statement. “But it’s a two-way street. Long-time, dedicated employees, like those in this case, are entitled to expect that their employers will not discharge them because of their age and in defiance of federal law. When Stack Bros. fired Mr. Virta and Ms. Kolodzeske because of their age, it ruptured the band of loyalty. This settlement is a way to make things right.” ####  ##### Stack Brothers’ attorney, James B. Sherman, president and CEO of Wessels Sherman Joerg Liszka Laverty Seneczko P.C. in Minneapolis, said in a statement: “As the EEOC’s trial attorney noted in a recent interview, in his deposition the owner of Stack Bros. testified that he determined he no longer needed the two employees in question several years prior to their departures. ####  ##### “Rather than letting them go at that time the owner notified both employees years in advance that they would be retained until reaching the age of 62 based on the assumption that they would become eligible to receive (S)ocial (S)ecurity. Consequently, the allegation that these individuals were terminated simply for turning 62 has always been vehemently denied. ####  ##### “Stack Bros.’ decision to resolve this lawsuit was made to avoid further disruptions to its business and the ongoing costs of litigation against a large federal agency with vast resources. In doing so Stack Bros. has not admitted to any wrongdoing.” ####  ##### In July, Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Los Angeles L.L.C., which was charged with failing to hire management trainees who were over 40, agreed to pay $425,000 to settle an age discrimination suit filed by the EEOC. #### "

"Employers continue to stumble on FMLA issues ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Disability"," ##### A Family Medical Leave Act case in which an allegedly abusive employee was terminated three days after he submitted FMLA paperwork illustrates the need for FMLA training, says an expert. ####  ##### James Hefti, a tool and die designer at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin-based Brunk Industries Inc. was repeatedly the subject of complaints by colleagues who said he said he made inappropriate and offensive comments, according to last month's ruling by the U.S. District Court in Milwaukee in James Hefti v. Brunk Industries Inc. ####  ##### According to one employee's complaint, for instance, Mr. Hefti “would tell co-workers what they were doing wrong using an unprofessional and degrading tone of voice, and instigate arguments with others as well.” ####  ##### In March 2013, Mr. Hefti requested FMLA leave became his son was suffering from various mental health issues and he needed to arrive late or leave early to help drop him off or pick him up from school, according to the ruling. His supervisor, Rick Eisel, told him “that Brunk paid for Hefti's insurance and thus expected him to be at work.” When Mr. Hefti told Mr. Eisel he had turned in his FMLA paperwork, Mr. Eisel “appeared frustrated and aggravated,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Hefti was terminated three days later, with the stated reason being that his communications with co-workers “were unprofessional and generally inappropriate. “ ####  ##### Mr. Hefti filed suit in federal court, charging the company had interfered with his FMLA rights and fired him in retaliation for exercising them. The court refused Brunk's motion to dismiss the case. ####  ##### “If Hefti was really on the road to being fired, it seems odd that Eisel would be upset about Hefti taking time away from work,” said Judge Rudolph T. Randa in his ruling. ####  ##### “On the contrary, it seems that Eisel would welcome the respite from a belligerent employee. Thus, the inference can be drawn that the stated reason for Hefti's termination was a pretext for discrimination.” ####  ##### Jeffrey Nowak, a partner with Franczek Radelet P.C. in Chicago, said, “What's maddening about the case is that, by all accounts, this seemed like one awful employee to interact with, and yet the employer trips itself up with one insensitive comment by a manager. ####  ##### “This case screams for FMLA training for managers,” said Mr. Nowak. “In a workforce, so often these kinds of situations arise due to managers not understanding how to handle these situations due to a lack of training. They get frustrated, and that often manifests itself in what managers then say to employees, and as a result, it results in a great deal of risk for the company.” #### "

"Takata recall said to involve more than 11 carmakers","Risk Management","Auto liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Takata Corp.'s unprecedented recall of potentially deadly air bag inflators affects more than the 11 auto manufacturers that have already been identified, the top U.S. auto safety regulator said on Monday. ####  ##### Mark Rosekind, who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told reporters that his agency will disclose new automakers at a one-hour public hearing on the Takata recall set for Thursday. ####  ##### ""It goes beyond the 11,"" said Mr. Rosekind, who met with automakers and suppliers affected by the Takata recall over the summer. On Thursday, NHTSA is expected to make a case that it should coordinate the Takata recall to ensure that an estimated 19 million defective Takata air bag inflators in U.S. vehicles are replaced by safer alternatives. ####  ##### Mr. Rosekind also said he believes automakers could follow the lead of General Motors Co. by moving quickly on Takata-related recalls as additional attention is focused on the danger. ####  ##### ""It would not surprise me if other people decide to deal earlier and faster with these issues,"" Mr. Rosekind said. ####  ##### The air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal shrapnel into passenger compartments, have been linked to at least eight deaths and more than 100 injuries worldwide. ####  ##### Experts say the ammonium nitrate used as a chemical accelerator in the inflators could become unstable after being exposed to high humidity over a period of time. Some have suggested that auto design, including how well sealed passenger compartments are against humidity, could also be a factor. ####  ##### ""Think about age, high humidity, all the different factors. Now you add design of the vehicle,"" Mr. Rosekind said. ####  ##### Newer Takata inflators have not been shown to be a problem, he added. ####  ##### ""So far the testing is showing that the newer ones seem to be solid,"" Mr. Rosekind said. #### "

Hospira has more than $35 million in government contracts for developing and manufacturing injection medications for the U.S. government, according to the DOL. ####  ##### In addition to paying the $400,000, Hospira committed to hiring 11 female job applicants, according to the DOL. ####  ##### The OFCCP found in its investigation that female applicants for pharmacy attendant positions were hired at much lower rates than similarly qualified male applicants at Hospira's McPherson, Kansas, facility, and that Hospira violated record-keeping requirements by failing to preserve employment applications and interview forms, the DOL said. ####  ##### “Discrimination is preventable when employers have nondiscriminatory selection procedures in place and see to it that they are followed,” said OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu, in the statement. “Hospira has worked proactively with our agency to resolve the alleged discrimination and to ensure that all required employment records will be maintained going forward.” ####  ##### Hospira said in a statement it “believes hiring practices at the plant have been fair.To close this matter from 2012 out, the company has entered into a conciliation agreement with the OFCCP. Hospira has a strong track record of compliance with OFCCP requirements and is confident our hiring practices support the company's priority of employing diverse and skilled talent.” ####  ##### Last week, a Minnesota fastener company agreed to pay $1.3 million to settle OFCCP charges that it discriminated against 171 black and female job applicants who sought general warehouse positions at two of its distribution facilities in Indianapolis and Atlanta. #### "
"Fired engineering worker gets race, wage bias case reinstated","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Claims Disputes, General liability"," ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a race discrimination charge filed by a former engineering firm employee who was allegedly hired at a lower salary than a similarly-qualified white worker, then became the first employee involuntarily terminated in a reduction in force after he complained. ####  ##### Melvin Smith was hired as an instructor/trainer as part of a project where URS Corp., which is now a unit of Los Angeles-based Aecom Technology Corp., was hired by the U.S. Army to destroy munitions at a facility in Arkansas, according to Wednesday’s ruling by the 8th U.S. circuit Court of appeals in St. Louis in Melvin Smith v. URS Corp. ####  ##### Although Mr. Smith sought a position of training specialist at a salary of $46,000, he was hired with a salary of $57,668 per year. Five months later, URS hired a white applicant, Jesse Griffin, who had also applied for a position of training specialist, at a salary of $65,000 a year and gave him the title of senior training specialist. ####  ##### Two months later it hired another black male applicant, Stanley Ellis, as a training specialist at salary of $57,668. Four other trainers, three of whom were white and one of whom was Hispanic, were subsequently hired as senior training specialists at a higher wage than Mr. Smith or Mr. Ellis, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Smith learned of the salary disparity and complained to training manager Ted Howard. Mr. Howard later conducted a subjective ranking of the trainers, and placed Mr. Smith and Mr. Ellis first in line to be terminated in a reduction in force although, unlike the two men, Mr. Griffith and another trainer who were ranked higher had disciplinary reports on their personnel files. Mr. Smith was subsequently the first trainer to be involuntarily terminated in a reduction in force. ####  ##### Mr. Smith filed suit, charging race discrimination and retaliation. The U.S. District Court in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, granted URS summary judgment dismissing the case, stating Mr. Smith had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. ####  ##### The appeals court reinstated the case in a 2-1 ruling. Between Mr. Smith’s and Mr. Ellis’ hiring, “a white man without meaningfully different qualifications applied for a position in the same department to perform the same work and received a higher-ranking and higher-paying position than the black men (a position for which he had applied),” said the majority opinion, in reversing dismissal of the racial discrimination charge. The court also said the lower court, which did not discuss the retaliation claim, should address that issue. ####  ##### The dissenting opinion said because Mr. Smith was hired at a salary that was $10,000 per year more than he requested, he had not suffered an adverse employment action in the hiring process. ####  ##### In June, an appeals court reinstated a retaliation lawsuit filed by a District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority worker who said he was terminated in retaliation for complaining about racial discrimination. #### "

Years of low interest rates mean many schemes are in deficit and these sometimes need to be filled by the company before the life insurer takes on the risk. ####  ##### Aon Hewitt said in a report there had been £3.6 billion pounds in bulk annuity deals in the second quarter, compared with only £800 million in the first quarter. ####  ##### ""With insurers busy on a substantial number of transactions which could conclude before Christmas, £10 billion is not an unrealistic expectation for year."" ####  ##### But European Solvency II capital rules to be introduced in January are likely to mean insurers have to set aside more money to cover the cost of bulk annuity transactions, and these have been a concern. ####  ##### ""2015 has been a period of flux,"" Aon Hewitt said, pointing out that on Solvency II, ""some details have remained obstinately gray."" ####  ##### Life insurers are moving to reinsure this business outside Europe to soften the impact of the new rules. ####  ##### Prudential P.L.C. and Legal & General Group P.L.C. were the most active in the bulk annuity market in the year to date, the report said. #### "

It's just more capital flowing in. You can call it whatever you want.” said Rod Fox, managing partner for TigerRisk Partners in Stamford, Connecticut. “And what we see and hear is that there's still a significant amount of it that wants to come in.” ####  ##### Mr. Fox is bullish on the sector. ####  ##### “We think it's more than doubling over the next five years,” said Mr. Fox. “Our number was $180 billion to $200 billion, and I still think that's still within the ballpark.” ####  ##### Aon Securities Inc. put the total as of June 30 at $68.4 billion. ####  ##### Catastrophe bonds expand ####  ##### Private catastrophe bonds are helping fuel growth. ####  ##### Expansion of the private catastrophe bond market has been rapid, having grown to $846.9 million of capital raised in 19 deals through Oct. 13 of this year from $561.5 million in 17 deals in all of 2014 and $181.2 million in six deals in 2013, said Cory Anger, global head of ILS structuring at GC Securities, a division of MMC Securities Corp., in New York. ####  ##### Private catastrophe bonds offer clients the potential for lower limits and costs. ####  ##### “It's done in a way where you can do smaller limits, something under $75 million, and it's done in a less rigorous way with less paperwork and modeling so that the expenses don't overwhelm the all-in pricing,” said Ms. Anger. ####  ##### One source, however, reiterated a lasting concern hanging over the capital markets. ####  ##### “Obviously it hasn't been tested yet with a big event,” said Steve Levy, president, reinsurance, for Munich Reinsurance America Inc. in Princeton, New Jersey. ####  ##### But he remains confident overall. ####  ##### “Our sense is that the investors who are really committed to the market will likely remain after a major event, but there will be some investors who will decide to withdraw from the marketplace once it is really tested with a major event,” said Mr. Levy. #### "

Cook Paper Recycling Corp. ####  ##### Mr. Pittman filed suit against the company, charging sex discrimination on the basis of his sexual orientation. A circuit court in Kansas City, Missouri, dismissed the case, and the appeals court upheld the ruling. ####  ##### “The plain language of the Missouri Human Rights Act is clear and unambiguous,” said the appeals court's 2-1 majority opinion. ####  ##### “Employers cannot discriminate against employees on the basis of their 'sex.' The clear meaning prohibiting discrimination based upon 'sex' under the Missouri Human Rights Act intended by the Missouri legislature … has nothing to do with sexual orientation.” ####  ##### “Unlike many other states, the Missouri legislature has not enacted legislation prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals by adding sexual orientation as protected class,” said the ruling. “It could have done so” had it so desired, said the ruling. ####  ##### The dissenting judge's opinion states: “Given the fact that the Missouri Human Rights Act is a remedial statute to be construed liberally to include those cases within the spirit of the law with all reasonable doubts to be construed in favor of applicability to the case, I would find that Pittman stated a claim” under the act “and leave it to the jury to decide whether Pittman can provide the elements necessary to prevail on his claim of sexual harassment.” ####  ##### According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit sexual orientation discrimination. Current federal law does not explicitly extend civil rights protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. ####  ##### In July, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held in a < a href=""/article/20150717/NEWS06/150719848"">divided ruling applicable only to federal workers that workplace sexual orientation discrimination is illegal under federal law. #### "
"RIMS reports chart growth of enterprise risk management ","Risk Management","Enterprise Risk Management, Risk Management"," ##### CHICAGO — The implementation of enterprise risk management is making significant strides, according to two executive reports released Monday at the Risk & Insurance Management Society's enterprise risk management conference in Chicago. ####  ##### The reports, written by Carol Fox, the RIMS director of strategic & enterprise risk  practice, and Steve Minsky, CEO and founder of LogicManager, are tools risk professionals can use when assessing their current programs and making necessary changes to their future risk management strategies. ####  ##### “Adopting ERM is a commitment,” RIMS President Rick Roberts said in a news release. “The initial implementation process is only the beginning. Risk professionals must continue to work to advance their risk programs, to maintain support from leadership and keep operations managers engaged.” ####  ##### The RIMS “State of ERM Report 2015” compares data from the organization's risk maturity model that was collected over the past seven years. The last such report was issued in 2008. The findings in the report suggest that competency drivers, or the processes that are put in place at all levels of an organization when applying enterprise risk management techniques, have improved considerably since the previous report. ####  ##### Another trend found within the collected data was that more than 2,000 organizations were using the RIMS risk maturity model to assess their maturity levels and make action plan improvements, a “250% increase over the 564 organizations studied in 2008,” the report said. ####  ##### The second RIMS report, “About the RIMS Risk Maturity Model” provides background about the model used and the drivers that define a well-managed ERM program, a RIMS news release said Monday. ####  ##### The “State of ERM Report 2015” and “About RIMS Risk Maturity Model” are available in RIMS' risk knowledge library. #### "
"Putting big data to work in search of next asbestos","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, General liability"," ##### Casualty catastrophe modeling is increasingly a focus of insurers and reinsurers as markets seek to identify and measure the next mass tort exposure. ####  ##### Lloyd's of London and Los Angeles-based modeler Praedicat Inc. earlier this month released a report outlining the challenges of casualty cat analysis. Praedicat has developed models that mine data from a variety of public sources to identify and quantify emerging mass tort risks and then apply the information to insurer portfolios. ####  ##### Reinsurance units of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. and Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. have also developed liability cat models using large databases of historic losses. ####  ##### While the insurance industry's typical response to liability disasters like asbestos has been to limit or bar coverage, successful modeling may allow insurers to underwrite more selectively and manage risk accumulation, reducing coverage bans and limitations, according to Lloyd's. ####  ##### Reinsurers, including the insurance-linked securities market, may also develop products to spread accumulation risk, Lloyd's noted in its report. ####  ##### While property cat modeling has been able to rely on meteorology, seismology, historical loss patterns and geo-specific risk data, modeling emerging casualty risks “is a relatively new field without an established methodology,” Lloyd's said in its Oct. 15 report, “Emerging Liability Risks: Harnessing Big Data Analytics.” ####  ##### Praedicat — which, backed by Newark, California-based catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc., released its first liability cat model in February — starts by mining millions of peer-reviewed science journal articles and other data sources to identify substances and products that may pose threats of bodily injury or environmental damage. The model monitors scientific research on possible causal links between a product and injuries “before it matures to the point that it can support litigation,” according to the Lloyd's report. ####  ##### The model is also designed to “contextualize” a given risk, comparing its potential impact to other emerging and historical risks; and to use detailed information about a policyholder company's products and operations to place the company on a “map” of those exposed to liability disasters, the report explains. ####  ##### Praedicat then applies the model's data to an insurer's portfolio to quantify its exposure to mass litigation. The model can also be used to analyze an industry's mass tort exposure and to measure an insurer's clash exposure across industries in a given line of coverage, according to Praedicat. ####  ##### Others have developed their own models for casualty catastrophes. Marsh & McLennan's Guy Carpenter & Co. L.L.C. unveiled its ForCas model in March, focusing first on measuring insurers' exposure to “sudden disasters,” such as oil rig explosions, that can generate multibillion-dollar cleanup costs, environmental liabilities and fines. In June, it expanded the model to cover catastrophe risks of financial institutions across directors and officers liability, errors and omissions, excess casualty and fidelity lines; and cyber exposures including privacy liability, network security liability, business interruption and data asset losses. ####  ##### Willis Re, meanwhile, has developed eNTAIL, which uses an analysis of more than 30 years of casualty cat events to project a probability distribution of potential future client insurer losses, according to the broker. Separately, Willis Re earlier this year announced a $400 million reinsurance facility, dubbed PRIMO, to provide ceding insurers with coverage for liability cat accumulation exposures. The facility, backed by 20 reinsurers, covers multiple accident years across all casualty and professional liability lines. ####  ##### “While the world has changed since asbestos litigation emerged, the interplay between science, technology-driven innovation and risk which can drive the accumulation of exposure has not,” Lloyd's observed in its report. Lloyd's noted possible toxicity of nanomaterials and potential environmental impacts of oil and gas hydrofracking among the emerging risks. ####  ##### Modeling that makes these exposures more predictable could help insurers and policyholders, sources say. ####  ##### “The results from casualty catastrophe modeling can lead to better underwriting — for example, risk selection, pricing for future events, portfolio optimization (and) exposure through policy terms,” according to a 2013 analysis by Towers Watson & Co. ####  ##### Modeling can also help map realistic disaster scenarios, validate capital model assumptions and test risk mitigation strategies, Towers Watson said. #### "
"Bill would allow nonprofits to cover property in risk retention groups","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Political Risk, Insurance-linked Securities, Property"," ##### Nearly three decades after federal lawmakers passed legislation expanding coverages risk retention groups can provide to member-owners, a new effort is being launched to further expand RRGs. ####  ##### Legislation introduced Wednesday by Reps. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., and Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., would allow certain risk retention groups to cover policyholders’ property risks. ####  ##### Specifically, the measure, H.R. 3794, would allow RRGs to write property coverages for policyholders that are nonprofit organizations with tax-exempt status or educational institutions and educational-related institutions that are nonprofit organizations or governmental entities. ####  ##### The expansion of coverage, though, only would be available to RRGs that have been operating for at least 10 years, while the RRG would have to maintain capital and surplus of at least $10 million. ####  ##### The legislation also only would allow adding property coverage as long as the total insured value of risks of any individual policyholder insured by the RRG does not exceed $50 million. ####  ##### Backers of the legislation say the expansion is needed because small to medium sized nonprofit organizations often cannot obtain property coverage on a standalone basis. ####  ##### “We are trying to solve a real need in the marketplace,” said Pamela Davis, president and CEO of the Vermont-domiciled Alliance of Nonprofits for Insurance Risk Retention Group in Santa Cruz, California. ####  ##### Virtually all of the RRG’s 6,200 member-owners would benefit if Congress passed the expansion legislation, Ms. Davis said. ####  ##### Some organizations, though, oppose the measure. “Allowing RRGs to write nearly any form of commercial insurance coverage while retaining a weaker and preferential system of regulatory oversight will create an uneven playing field, distort the competitive balance within the insurance market, and, most importantly, place consumers at increased risk,” Charles Symington, senior vice president of external and federal government affairs at the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia said in a statement. ####  ##### Other insurance-related organizations, though, support the bill. The expansion will help an “underserved market,” said Joel Wood, senior vice president of the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers in Washington. ####  ##### The National Risk Retention Association does not yet have a position on the measure, said Jon Harkavy, NRRA’s secretary. ####  ##### But speaking personally, Mr. Harkavy, who also is vice president and general counsel of RRG manager Risk Services L.L.C. in Washington, said if Congress does expand the law, that expansion should not be limited to nonprofit organizations. ####  ##### “We don’t want a two-tier system,” he said. ####  ##### Congress passed the original risk retention group legislation in 1981. The law allowed RRGs, which are special group captives to provide coverage to member-owners after meeting the licensing requirements of one state. The 1981 law, though, limited RRG coverage to product liability and completed operations risks. ####  ##### Then, in 1986, Congress expanded the law to allow RRGs to write all casualty coverages, except workers compensation. ####  ##### Currently, there are about 235 RRGs. #### "
"Engage all levels of employees to achieve effective cyber security","Risk Management","Employment Practices, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, Technology"," ##### As emerging technologies introduce new security risks to businesses, risk managers should have a solid plan in place to both prevent and respond to a potential cyber attack, according to a recent panel of insurance industry experts. ####  ##### But the plan should strike a balance between protecting the firm from cyber breaches while still enabling the business to perform its operations with the technology necessary to do so, experts said Tuesday during the Insurance Executive Forum held by Illinois State University's Katie School of Insurance and Financial Services in Chicago. ####  ##### Data breaches are becoming more common, making response plans all the more essential to protect the property and reputation of an organization. According to a September 2014 study by the Traverse City, Michigan-based Ponemon Institute L.L.C., 43% of companies said they suffered a cyber attack in 2014, compared with 33% in 2013. ####  ##### And employers are acting: 73% of organizations have developed a data breach response plan in 2014, up from 61% the year before, the Ponemon Institute found. ####  ##### An effective data breach response plan includes three parts, said Greg Bee, the director of corporate information security governance and chief information security officer with Bloomington, Illinois-based insurer Country Financial. ####  ##### The first step is to determine how to prevent a breach from occurring by assessing the risks of the organization and where the gaps in security are, Mr. Bee said. Firms should also prepare to “dissect the attack” once it occurs, he said. ####  ##### “We have to understand why we're being attacked, how we're being attacked and what the motive of the attackers (is),” Mr. Bee said. ####  ##### Third, if a breach does occur, organizations should know ahead of time how to portray themselves in the public. Holding mock cyber incidents can help prepare the organization in all scenarios, he said. ####  ##### Companies that are successful at battling cyber breaches include all leadership and workers in the plan to prevent attacks, said W. James Regan, senior vice president of FINPRO at Marsh L.L.C. ####  ##### But it's important to note that employees are often one of an organization's greatest “vulnerabilities,” said Paul Larson, senior vice president and specialty risk manager with Chubb Specialty Insurance, a unit of Chubb Corp. ####  ##### As such, training workers in cyber security is necessary. For instance, Country Financial began testing its employees' cyber security practices four years ago by sending a fake phishing email crafted by a third-party organization to 400 workers during the benefits enrollment period, Mr. Bee said. The email was made to look as if it was sent from the benefits team, and 320 employees clicked the malicious link. Forty-percent actually handed over credentials, he said. ####  ##### But after performing the test each year since, last year only 2% of Country Financial's employees clicked the malicious link, and only one person gave up credentials, Mr. Bee said. ####  ##### Securing cyber insurance ####  ##### The insurance industry has “done a good job expanding cyber” insurance coverage to include potential sources of costs, such as business interruption and extortion, Mr. Regan said. ####  ##### According to the Ponemon Institute study, in 2014 26% of organizations adopted a cyber insurance policy, compared with 10% in 2013. ####  ##### Insurance options for middle market employers are widely available, and organizations can outsource to a third-party vendor to perform an annual review of the cyber security practices, experts said. ####  ##### According to Mr. Larson, a good agent or broker “is critical” because they work to find gaps in the cyber security of an organization. But in the end, he said, data breach preparedness begins with a good cyber security policy in the workplace. #### "

Carroll and Larry Moore who were partners for restaurant Tomaydo-Tomahhdo Express L.L.C. and a delivery catering business that ultimately led to a copyright disagreement. ####  ##### Mr. Moore conceived hit recipes for the restaurant's menu, according to Tuesday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals in Tomaydo-Tomahhdo L.L.C. et al. v. George Vozary, et al. ####  ##### Ms. Carroll and Mr. Moore parted ways in 2007, with Mr. Moore signing a share purchase agreement agreeing to return all recipes to Ms. Carroll. Mr. Moore opened a catering business in 2011. ####  ##### In 2012, Ms. Carroll assembled a recipe book based on Mr. Moore's recipes and applied for copyright protection in 2014. She then sued Mr. Moore for copyright infringement, among other charges, claiming he was using the recipes in his catering business. ####  ##### But to prove copyright infringement creativity must be involved, and there is nothing creative about a mere collection of recipes, said a three-judge appeals court panel in Cincinnati in affirming a lower court ruling dismissing the case. ####  ##### It may have been different had the collection included “musings about the spiritual nature of cooking,” said the ruling, in quoting another court decision. But the plaintiffs have “not shown that any aspect of their recipe book is original and would therefore enjoy copyright protection.” #### "

"Allergan unit to plead guilty to health care fraud, pay $125 million","Risk Management","Prescription Drug Benefits, D&O, General liability, Health Care Costs"," ##### (Reuters) — Warner Chilcott U.S. Sales L.L.C., now part of Botox maker Allergan P.L.C., agreed to plead guilty to felony health care fraud and pay $125 million to resolve U.S. charges that it paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe several of its drugs. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Justice, which announced the settlement, also said former Warner Chilcott President W. Carl Reichel was arrested in Boston on Thursday and charged with one count of conspiring to pay kickbacks. ####  ##### At least four other people have pleaded guilty or been charged over Warner Chilcott’s activities, the department said. ####  ##### The settlement resolves charges that from 2009 to 2013, Warner Chilcott illegally marketed seven drugs, including Asacol to treat ulcerative colitis, and Actonel and Atelvia to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis. ####  ##### Investigators said this marketing included the making of payments or offering of perks such as expensive restaurant meals to persuade doctors to prescribe the drugs. ####  ##### Warner Chilcott agreed to pay a $22.94 million criminal fine and admit to paying kickbacks, improperly inducing insurers to pay for Atelvia prescriptions, and making unsubstantiated claims about Actonel. ####  ##### It also agreed to pay $102.06 million to the U.S. government and states to resolve civil charges that it caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs. ####  ##### Allergan is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. It said it cooperated with the U.S. probe and had previously set aside funds for the accord. ####  ##### CEO Brent Saunders said in a statement that Allergan is committed to operating “in full compliance with the regulations and high ethical standards we have set.” ####  ##### Mr. Reichel, 57, of Chester, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Boal in Boston, and was released without bail, said his lawyer Joe Savage. ####  ##### “The charges brought today by the U.S. Attorney’s office are false,” said Mr. Savage, a partner at Goodwin Procter. “For more than 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Carl Reichel worked hard and did the right thing, and these baseless claims can’t change that.” ####  ##### Whistleblowers who sued Warner Chilcott under the federal False Claims Act in 2011 will receive $22.9 million from the civil settlement, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### Warner Chilcott was acquired by Actavis P.L.C. in October 2013. Actavis bought Allergan in March 2015 and took its name. ####  ##### Also on Thursday, Allergan confirmed that it is in preliminary talks to merge with drugmaker Pfizer Inc. #### "
"Cable provider Cox pays $595,000 fine to resolve FCC data breach probe","Risk Management",""," ##### Cable firm Cox Communications Inc. will pay a $595,000 fine to resolve a Federal Communications Commission investigation as to whether it failed to properly protect its 6 million subscribers’ personal information in connection with a 2014 data breach, the FCC said. ####  ##### Atlanta-based Cox said in a statement its commitment to data security is a top priority, and that only 61 customers were affected by the breach. ####  ##### The FCC said in a statement Thursday that its enforcement bureau’s investigation found that Cox’s electronic data systems were breached in August 2014 by a hacker using the alias “EvilJordie,” a member of the “Lizard Squad” hacker group. ####  ##### The FCC said EvilJordie pretended to be from Cox’s information technology department and convinced both a Cox customer service representative and Cox contractor to enter their account IDs and passwords into a fake “phishing” website. ####  ##### The FCC said with these credentials, the hacker gained unauthorized access to Cox customers’ personally identifiable information, including names, addresses, email addresses, secret questions and answers, PIN numbers and, in some cases, Social Security and driver’s license numbers. ####  ##### The hacker then posted some customers’ information on social media sites, changed some customers’ account passwords and shared the compromised account credentials with another alleged Lizard Squad member, the FCC said. ####  ##### In addition to paying the $595,000 penalty, the settlement also requires Cox to provide all affected customers with one year of free credit monitoring, among other terms. ####  ##### “Cable companies have a wealth of sensitive information about us, from our credit card numbers to our pay-per-view selections,” said Washington-based FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc in the FCC statement. “This investigation shows the real harm that can be done by a digital identity thief with enough information to change your passwords, lock you out of your own accounts, post your personal data on the Web, and harass you through social media. We appreciate that Cox will now take robust steps to keep their customers' information safe online and off.” ####  ##### Cox said in its statement that its “commitment to privacy and data security is a top priority for the company, and we take our responsibility to protect our customers’ personal information very seriously.  While we regret that this incident occurred, our information security program ensured that we were able to react quickly and limit the incident to 61 customers. ####  ##### “Cox also promptly reported the incident to the FBI and worked closely with them in their investigation, resulting in the arrest of the perpetrator.  We will continue to enhance our privacy and information security programs to protect the personal information that is entrusted to us.” ####  ##### Blogger Brian Krebs, who focuses on data breaches, said in his blog Friday that he was among those affected by the breach against Cox, his former Internet provider. #### "

"AIG profit hit by weak underwriting, lower investment income","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Risk Management, AIG, Canada, China, Financial Results"," ##### (Reuters) — American International Group Inc.’s quarterly operating profit plunged as income at all but one of its underwriting businesses declined and tumultuous markets hurt its investments. ####  ##### AIG, the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, also incurred a hefty $274 million pretax restructuring charge that also hurt results in the quarter. ####  ##### The company said restructuring costs would total $500 million through 2017 as it simplifies its business to eventually save about $400-$500 million a year. ####  ##### AIG shares were down 1.9% after the bell. ####  ##### The company also said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share compared with 12.5 cents a year earlier. ####  ##### The increase in dividend comes less than a week after billionaire Carl Icahn urged AIG to break itself apart, cut costs more aggressively and give back more to shareholders in one of the largest activist campaigns of the year. ####  ##### Mr. Icahn’s proposal, supported by hedge fund manager John Paulson, has sparked talks among AIG directors about spinning off or selling the insurer’s small mortgage-insurance business, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. ####  ##### Operating income after tax tumbled 60% to $691 million, or 52 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, widely missing the average analyst estimate of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ####  ##### Pretax operating income from AIG’s insurance operations slumped 41% to $1.47 billion, as earnings fell in all its underwriting lines but mortgage guarantee insurance. ####  ##### At the commercial property and casualty insurance business, traditionally AIG’s forte, pretax operating income fell 40% to $569 million, hurt by lower investment income and rates. ####  ##### Travelers Cos. Inc., which vies with AIG for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit last month, helped by higher underwriting gains. ####  ##### AIG, which traces its roots to a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also made a $195 million loss from investments in the People’s Insurance Group of China Ltd. and its subsidiary, PICC Property and Casualty Co.

They include regulatory change such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States driving health care M&As, low interest rates and rising equity markets, which encourage debt-fueled growth and expansion by Chinese and Japanese companies in search of nondomestic growth opportunities. ####  ##### Moody’s predicts that M&As will continue owing to the fragmented insurance industries in many countries; “continued attractive economic fundamentals in many regions (low interest rates/funding costs and forced sellers,” and the international growth aspirations of many buyers. ####  ##### Moody’s said acquisitions are likely to stop only if interest rates rise significantly and equity markets fall “dramatically.” It added, though, that a drop in equity markets might reduce the sale price of acquisitions. #### "

Out of the 219 customer reviews on Amazon’s website, 34% of reviewers gave the toy only one star, with one reviewer saying he spent two and a half hours trying to remove 14 balls from his daughter’s hair and urging fellow Amazon shoppers to “buy this toy for someone if you hate them or their child.” ####  ##### Other Amazon reviewers were more forgiving, with 25% giving the toy five stars and some blaming inattentive parents for the hair tangles. ####  ##### In response to the backlash, Toronto-based Spin Master Ltd., which manufactures the toy, put an instructional video on its website telling parents how to remove the stuck Bunchems from their child’s hair, starting with applying conditioner or vegetable oil, combing below the affected hair areas and then sliding the Bunchems down and off the child’s hair. ####  ##### The video advises parents to repeat the process if they don’t succeed at removing the Bunchems on the first try, but some Amazon reviewers say Spin Master’s conditioner/vegetable oil solution simply does not work and suggest other tools, including pliers and toothpicks, to pry the toys loose. #### "

"Lockheed, FAA give flight to new hybrid airship","Risk Management","Risk Management, Aviation, Off Beat"," ##### A hybrid airship designed by Lockheed Martin could revolutionize the transport of large cargo to remote sites. ####  ##### Lockheed and the Federal Aviation Administration have worked together for more than a decade to define the criteria to certify hybrid airships for transport, and the FAA has certified the unique, bulbous airships for flight, the company said Tuesday. ####  ##### Thanks to their unique shape and air cushion landing system, hybrid airships can economically transport heavy cargo to and from remote locations. They burn significantly less fuel when compared to conventional aircraft, which makes them environmentally friendly, according to news reports. ####  ##### The airship’s four hovercraft-like air cushioned landing pads allow it to land on a cushion of air onto flat land or water without being required to be moored on large towers like traditional airships. The pad functions can also reverse to grip the ground after landing to keep the airship stable to safely load and unload cargo. The hybrid airship offers the simplicity of a pickup truck by carrying cargo loads and personnel in and out of remote areas daily, not just certain seasons or only after major road, rail or airport infrastructure is developed. ####  ##### Hybrid Enterprises, the airship resellers for Lockheed said the helium filled airship can carry 20 tons of cargo, but can easily be scaled to roughly the size of a football field with 500 tons of capacity. It has a fuel capacity of 5,000 gallons with a range of 1,400 nautical miles, and can cruise at a speed of 60 knots. ####  ##### Lockheed kicked off sales for the 20-ton variety of the hybrid airship earlier this year and is on track to deliver operational airships by as early as 2018. ####  ##### Given that hybrid airships did not fit within existing FAA regulations, a new set of criteria allowing nonrigid hybrid airships to safely operate in a commercial capacity had to be created. Transport Canada was also involved in the development of this criteria to ensure it included safety concerns unique to Canada. #### "

Given the industry retention had been unaltered since 2006, there seemed to be scope to return more of the risk to the local market. We will continue to examine ways to secure more capacity from insurers and re-insurers, so as to increase scheme resilience and ensure that Pool Re only provides capacity that the market is unable to.” #### "

"Ballooning claims roil commercial auto sector","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Zurich, Auto liability"," ##### Changing players and increasing claim severity have shaken the commercial auto insurance sector as some insurers retrench amid soaring settlements and awards. ####  ##### Both American International Group Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. addressed commercial auto coverage in their latest results. ####  ##### AIG noted “higher current accident year losses in health care and in U.S. commercial automobile liability.” The company also said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was increasing commercial automobile liability reserves by $402 million for the nine-month period that ended Sept. 30. ####  ##### The company did not respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### Zurich went a step further in its third-quarter release, saying it would “exit two portfolios in global corporate, including part of the U.S. transportation business.” ####  ##### In response to questions, Zurich said last week it will no longer offer casualty cover for U.S. companies in three categories. ####  ##### “The majority of the business is long-haul trucking and some passenger transport services,” Zurich said in a statement. “Zurich is not exiting the U.S. auto liability, auto physical damage, workers compensation or general liability markets.” ####  ##### “There are carriers that had pretty adverse results and are taking, from what we see, pretty drastic action in the marketplace,” said Bill Smyth, vice president of casualty at Berkshire Hathaway Specialty in Boston, which runs the company's excess trucking and transportation book of business. ####  ##### “Obviously, some of the legacy carriers are feeling the pinch,” said Tony DeFelice, managing director of Aon Risk Solutions' national casualty practice in New York. ####  ##### One factor roiling the commercial auto market is an increase in severe claims, sources said. ####  ##### “I do believe that we have seen massive increases in terms of severity on auto,” Mr. DeFelice said. “Over the past year, I myself have witnessed about five large auto liability claims ranging from $7 to $8 million all the way up to $50 million.” ####  ##### Dan Aronson, U.S. primary casualty placement leader at Marsh L.L.C. in New York, cited an example of rising costs in auto claims. ####  ##### “Ten years ago we would have said that a large commercial auto claim would be $10 million dollars,” said Mr. Aronson. “Well, $10 million became $20 million, which became $30 million, and we've now seen some cases as high as $40 million, if not more, in the past couple of years.” ####  ##### “There have been some notable cases which have had astronomical settlement values in excess of $25 million and upwards,” said Pamela Ferrandino, national casualty practice leader at Willis North America Inc. in New York. “Those are big numbers, and it's very hard to differentiate a favorable risk from an average risk, no matter what your rate on line is, to ever price for that sort of volatility of loss.” ####  ##### “Everyone is agreeing that severity is an issue,” said Tracy Dolin-Benguigui, director of financial services ratings of North American insurance at Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. ####  ##### One key driver of costs is medical care as safer cars are allowing people to survive accidents that previously may have been fatal. ####  ##### “People survive accidents, but with absolutely critical injuries which require lifelong care; and the value of those lifelong care plans has dramatically skyrocketed in recent years,” said Steve Hackenburg, chief broking officer of national casualty at Aon Risk Solutions in New York. ####  ##### “Severity continues to be impacted by the rising cost of medical care,” said Steve Assennata, senior vice president and head of the client group specialty markets at Munich Reinsurance America Inc. ####  ##### “If you think about the average auto loss of significance, a big component of that is medical loss,” said Debbie Michel, executive vice president of national casualty for Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. in Chicago. ####  ##### General loss costs have also increased, some 4.0% in 2013, then 7.0% in 2014 and 8.0% in 2015, added Ms. Michel. ####  ##### As some insurers have moved to stem such losses and reduce their commercial auto business, others have seen opportunity. ####  ##### “Our growth through July of this year was about a 40% growth rate in terms of premium,” said Berkshire's Mr. Smyth. “If you look through the end of October, that doubled.” ####  ##### “We didn't write nearly as much in the first seven months as we have in the last three months,” said Mr. Smyth. ####  ##### That growth seems poised to continue. ####  ##### “The number of submissions, the number of requests and the number of folks who have come to track us down and say, 'Hey, we really want a quote from you,' has changed dramatically,” said Mr. Smyth. ####  ##### Berkshire Specialty has “been building out their infrastructure and ramping up production and in 2015 it continued to expand quite a bit,” said John Iten, a director at S&P, of Berkshire Specialty's overall business. ####  ##### Renewals amid the changes have varied. ####  ##### While 15% of clients saw rate increases, 23% saw rate decreases, and the largest group by far, 62%, renewed flat, said Aon's Mr. Hackenburg. ####  ##### “Today we are in what I would consider to be a flat rate environment,” said Ms. Ferrandino. ####  ##### Several sources agreed that there was ample capacity available and the sector remained competitive, allowing many clients to renew coverage without rate increases. ####  ##### “When I look at the spread of rate on our book of business, it's not like everyone is at plus 3% — there's good spread, just like there should be,” said Ms. Michel. #### "
"Honda, Takata settle airbag suits, lose round in class action case","Risk Management","Risk Management, Auto liability, D&O, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. judge has rejected a bid by air bag manufacturer Takata Corp. and automaker Honda Motor Co. to toss out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of millions of owners with potentially faulty airbag inflators, even as the firms are moving to quickly settle death claims. ####  ##### The Japanese companies have agreed to undisclosed settlements for six of eight deaths linked to ruptured inflators as U.S. prosecutors ramp up a probe of the ruptures and whether regulators were misled. Four settlements have been reached in recent months. ####  ##### Litigation arising from four of the six U.S. deaths has been settled, Honda spokesman Chris Martin said. Court records show a fifth U.S. death — in September 2014 in California — has also been settled. ####  ##### Honda has been working to settle claims quickly, Mr. Martin said. “Honda has worked in good faith to quickly resolve the concerns of those families,” he said. ####  ##### Honda, Takata and other automakers will continue to face a class-action suit filed on behalf of millions of owners that alleges Takata and the automakers violated anti-racketeering laws because of a ruling on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami. ####  ##### Since 2008, at least 19.2 million U.S. vehicles have been recalled for inflators that can rupture. The suit claims millions of car owners overpaid for vehicles with faulty airbags and the recalls reduced the value of those vehicles. ####  ##### “Honda looks forward to the opportunity to properly challenge plaintiffs’ claims,” Honda’s Mr. Martin said. He said the automaker is confident that the racketeering claim will be dismissed. ####  ##### Takata declined to comment on the ruling. ####  ##### The airbag manufacturer has bolstered its legal team. Lanny Breuer, a partner at Covington & Burling L.L.P. who served as U.S. assistant attorney general overseeing the criminal division from 2009-2013, said in a court filing in November that he was representing Takata in the civil lawsuit. ####  ##### The previously unreported civil settlements cover five airbag deaths in the United States — including two reported inflator deaths this year in Texas and Louisiana — and a 2014 incident in Malaysia in which a pregnant woman was killed and her baby subsequently died. Judge Moreno approved that settlement on Nov. 20. ####  ##### U.S. prosecutors have conducted interviews with Takata and Honda employees in both Japan and the United States, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit declined to comment. ####  ##### Mr. Martin declined to say if executives have been interviewed but said “Honda is actively cooperating with the DOJ investigation of Takata.” ####  ##### A federal grand jury has subpoenaed documents from Takata, but Honda said it has not received a grand jury subpoena. ####  ##### Honda has confirmed seven airbag deaths since 2009. An inflator is also suspected in the 2013 death of a California man in a 2002 Acura TL. #### "
"Positive 2016 results predicted for commercial insurers","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Mergers & Acquisitions, Financial Results"," ##### The U.S. commercial insurance industry will continue to see positive gains in 2016, according to a report published by Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA Inc. ####  ##### The company’s 2016 Market Outlook report, released Tuesday, indicated that favorable losses across most insurance lines and a lack in catastrophe property claims will provide positive underwriting gains in 2016. ####  ##### Some of the key findings in the report noted that gross domestic product was expected to continue to grow in 2016, though not as much as the previous two years, resulting in continued higher revenues, payrolls, and property values, which would be reflected in insurance premiums. ####  ##### Higher investment returns from rising interest rates should give insurers higher investment returns as well, the report said. ####  ##### The report found the insurance industry increasingly using data analysis to find loss trends, although it said it is not known if the data is being interpreted objectively or accurately. ####  ##### The report stated the continuation of mergers and acquisitions in the insurance and reinsurance market made achieving profitable organic growth difficult. ####  ##### “We expected M&A activity all along, but the magnitude of that activity, what with ACE-Chubb and XL-Catlin mergers, was much larger than we anticipated,” said Doug O’Brien, Wells Fargo’s New York-based casualty and alternative risk national practice leader. ####  ##### “Certain markets will enter into new product lines, which can prolong a buyer’s market,” he said. ####  ##### “I think it’s going to be more pronounced next year; as markets struggle to deploy their capacity, new product offerings and M&A are good for the marketplace,” he said. #### "

"AIG attempts balancing act amid pressures","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, AIG"," ##### American International Group Inc. will have to balance shareholder demands for profit and client desires for more product innovation to emerge successfully from its current woes. ####  ##### The New York-based insurer said four key executives — Commercial Insurance CEO John Doyle, Chief Financial Officer David Herzog, CEO of the Asia Pacific Region Jose Hernandez and Executive Vice President of Claims and Operations Eric Martinez — would leave. ####  ##### The December announcement came just weeks after AIG posted a third-quarter loss of $231 million. In an earnings call after releasing its results, President and CEO Peter Hancock said AIG planned to cut 23% of its 1,400 senior management positions, with further layoffs likely in 2016. ####  ##### The cost-cutting moves followed repeated calls by investor Carl Icahn that AIG be split into three separate entities — property/casualty, life and mortgage — to enhance shareholder value and allow it to get rid of its federally imposed systemically important financial institution designation. ####  ##### Although Mr. Hancock met with Mr. Icahn, no divestiture plan was announced. ####  ##### However, AIG subsequently said it would sell some of its stake in Chinese insurer PICC Property & Casualty Co. Ltd. in a deal worth nearly $752 million. ####  ##### The cost-cutting moves have raised questions among some risk managers and others whether AIG is backing away from its tradition of innovative products and services. In fact, some say the company already has softened its focus on innovation. ####  ##### “You just haven’t seen the innovation you used to see,” said a risk manager who asked not to be named. “It’s been very subtle. I would agree that they are not emphasizing new products.” ####  ##### “AIG is clearly in a defensive hunkered-down mode,” a broker who asked not to be named said. “People are scared for their jobs; and when you spend that much time behind closed doors trying to protect yourself, it doesn’t leave a lot of time to be responsive to the brokers or creative in the marketplace.” ####  ##### “They’re reducing their management structure to make it more nimble and, from a risk manager’s perspective, that’s a good thing,” said another risk manager who asked not to be identified. “If there is more access to senior management, that’s a positive. If the consequence of that is almost a commoditization of the product, they will be a less attractive option to the risk managers who deal with them because of a loss of their creativity in crafting unique solutions for large commercial insurance buyers.” ####  ##### A spokesman for AIG stressed, however, that the company remains committed to innovation in the marketplace. ####  ##### “AIG continues to be a leading innovator,” he said. ####  ##### “Whether you look at our lead position in cyber insurance and cyber risk management, the extensive build-out of our engineering capabilities, expanded use of (insurance-linked securities), large property limits, the industry’s first science team, data analytics, and our focus on emerging disruptive forces including the sharing economy, drones, the Internet of Things and driverless cars, AIG continues to be a thought leader in the market and product innovator for our clients,” he said. ####  ##### “Cost-cutting and innovation are not mutually exclusive,” said John Phelps, director of business risk solutions at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida Inc. in Jacksonville. “The health insurance industry is a perfect example of that. AIG senior leadership has to figure out the strategy that will allow them to continue to be innovative and meet marketplace demands while in a cost-cutting environment.” ####  ##### An equities analyst made much the same point. ####  ##### “AIG has been an innovative company for many, many years. The challenge will be as it navigates these difficult times to balance shareholders’ need for high margins against the need to invest in delivering value to customers and creating new innovative products and services,” said Josh Stirling, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein L.L.C. in New York. ####  ##### “It’s something you always need to be very careful about,” said Cliff Gallant, an analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc. in San Francisco. “Looking at their expense structure, it does seem they’re a little bloated and there’s need for expense cuts.” ####  ##### Still, “I think everybody brings something to the table, and AIG is known for having a lot of management experience and talent, and you don’t want to cut the wrong person. It’s always a risk when you’re going through something like this that you’ll lose some of your competitive edge. That’s one of the chief responsibilities of the CEO — in this case, Peter Hancock.” Mr. Gallant said Mr. Hancock “needs to make those calls on those positions, and there’s a lot of pressure on him.” ####  ##### One risk manager expressed concern over staff cuts already made and yet to come. ####  ##### “I am very disappointed to hear about John Doyle leaving AIG,” said Carolyn Snow, director of risk management at Humana Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. “He’s been a really good friend to Humana, and I’m sure a lot of other commercial accounts. I think his expertise and collaboration will be greatly missed.” #### "
"RIMS' new risk certification program exam April 10","Risk Management","Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Risk Management"," ##### The Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. on Friday launched its risk management professional certification program. ####  ##### RIMS plans to administer its first in-person RIMS-CRMP (Certified Risk Management Professional) exam on April 10, 2016 in San Diego for RIMS members with either a bachelor's degree (or global equivalent) in risk management and one year working full-time in risk management or a bachelor's (or global equivalent) in a non-risk management related field and three years of full-time employment in risk management, a statement said. ####  ##### For members without a bachelor's degree, seven years of risk management is required.

Additional online exams will be offered at an increased registration fee after the San Diego exam. ####  ##### In October of this year, the Federation of European Risk Management Associations launched its professional certification program for risk managers in Europe, known as rimap. #### "
"JetBlue crew member's ADA lawsuit reinstated","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, Disability, General liability"," ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by an inflight crew member against JetBlue Airways Inc., stating she has successfully argued she was disabled and may have been fired because of it. ####  ##### Shari Dooley was terminated by JetBlue in September 2013 because she had allegedly violated company policy regarding attendance or dependability, according to court papers in Shari Dooley v. JetBlue Airways Corp. ####  ##### Ms. Dooley filed suit in U.S. District Court in New York in June 2014, alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, among other charges. The court dismissed the case and Ms. Dooley appealed. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reinstated Ms. Dooley’s ADA claim on Friday. Ms. Dooley, who said she had suffered a fracture and has nerve damage, has plausibly claimed she was disabled, said the ruling. ####  ##### The circumstances of her termination also raise an inference of discrimination, said the appeals court. JetBlue ordinarily follows a progressive discipline policy regarding dependability that includes a multistep process, but Ms. Dooley was not afforded any of these steps, said the ruling. ####  ##### “When coupled with the closeness in time between the injury that caused her alleged disability and JetBlue’s initiation of the process that ultimately resulted in her firing (alleging that Dooley was ‘suspended without pay pending an investigation of dependability’ approximately two months after she was injured and fired approximately one-and-a-half months thereafter) these allegations ‘give plausible support to a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation,’” said the court in quoting an earlier ruling. ####  ##### The appeals court did affirm the District Court’s dismissal of several other charges, including a failure to accommodate under the ADA and retaliation and discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### In August, an appeals court reinstated an ADA discrimination charge in a case where a company official allegedly sought reasons to fire a worker after he had already decided to terminate her because of her disability. #### "

"FTC's cyber security win against Wyndham may lead to more enforcement actions","Risk Management",""," ##### The Federal Trade Commission's settlement of its lawsuit against Wyndham Worldwide Corp. in connection with the hotel chain's cyber breaches is likely to encourage further FTC action and enforcement in this area. ####  ##### The FTC had charged Parsippany, New Jersey-based Wyndham in its 2012 lawsuit with failing to properly safeguard consumer information held by its hotels, allowing intruders to gain unauthorized access to its computer network three times between April 2008 and January 2010. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 3rd US. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia unanimously held in August that the FTC had authority to regulate corporate cyber security and could pursue the lawsuit, without ruling on the lawsuit's merits. ####  ##### The settlement announced last week requires Wyndham to establish a comprehensive information security program designed to protect cardholder data but does not require the company to pay any fines. ####  ##### “It's a very big deal,” said Stephen J. Newman, a partner with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan L.L.P. in Los Angeles. “Wyndham was fighting very hard, and I think a lot of people were anticipating that they were going to try to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this.” ####  ##### That Wyndham accepted the FTC's complete jurisdiction over it is a “real feather in the (the FTC's) cap,” Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Mr. Newman said he believes Wyndham agreed to the settlement because “the deal did not require them to pay any money in penalties or investigative costs, and certainly Wyndham can walk away with their head held high in that they weren't writing a check.” ####  ##### FTC will become more aggressive as a result of the settlement, Mr. Newman said. The FTC won on this issue in the 3rd Circuit “and with Wyndham abandoning the fight, I don't see anyone else mounting a serious challenge to the FTC's authority in this area,” he said. “I think they will be much more vigorous in their enforcement efforts here.” ####  ##### “I think they'll at least pick up the pace, if not become more active,” said Mary Ellen Callahan, a partner with Jenner & Block L.L.P. in Washington. There was a “bit of a lull” while the Wyndham case was pending, she said. ####  ##### Under terms of the 20-year settlement agreement, the company must establish a comprehensive cyber security program and conduct annual information security audits of its program that conform to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard for certification of a company's security program. It must also maintain safeguards in connection to its franchisees' servers. ####  ##### Referring to the requirement on the payment card industry standard, Ms. Callahan said there has been a lot of discussion that the standard is insufficient. ####  ##### Many of the companies that have been breached followed this standard “and to use that as your baseline almost concedes that the paradigm isn't perfect,” said Ms. Callahan, who is former chief privacy officer for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ####  ##### But, “If you agree to these objective third party-standards, you're good enough, even if being good enough means you can be subject to a breach,” she said. ####  ##### “The FTC may want to make sure there are objective standards on which they can judge any of the companies,” Ms. Callahan said. ####  ##### FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in the FTC's statement that the settlement “marks the end of a significant case in the FTC's efforts to protect consumers from the harm caused by unreasonable data security.” ####  ##### “Not only will it provide important protection to consumers, but the court rulings in the case have affirmed the vital role the FTC plays in this important area,” she added. ####  ##### Wyndham said in a statement, “We chose to defend against this litigation based on our strong belief that we have had reasonable data security in place, and that the FTC's position could have had a negative impact on the franchise business model. ####  ##### “This settlement resolves these issues, and sets a standard for what the government considers reasonable data security of payment card information. ####  ##### “Safeguarding personal information remains a top priority for our company at a time when companies and government agencies are increasingly the targets of cyber attacks,” said the company. #### "

"Hello Barbie has it all — including cyber risks","Risk Management","Off Beat"," ##### Toymaker Mattel Inc. is trying to bring its iconic Barbie doll into the digital age by creating an interactive version that will actually talk back when children speak to their dolls. But due to security issues, so can hackers. ####  ##### Mattel introduced the original Barbie at the annual Toy Fair in New York in March 1959 and unveiled the Hello Barbie version in late November of this year, just in time for the holidays. Using Wi-Fi and speech recognition technology, Hello Barbie can hold conversations, play games, share stories and tell jokes, according to the company. The doll sells for about $70 on retailer Amazon.com's website. ####  ##### Security firm Bluebox discovered several issues with the Hello Barbie app, including that the app can be modified to reveal confidential information such as authentication credential passwords, according to a white paper released last week by the firm. The app will also connect a mobile device to any unsecured Wi-Fi network if it has Barbie in the name, allowing for a network spoofing attack to occur by an attacker impersonating the Barbie network to steal data, according to the white paper. ####  ##### The Hello Barbie app utilizes an authentication credential that can be re-used by attackers and also shipped with unused code that serves no function, but increases the overall attack surface, according to the white paper. ####  ##### In addition, the Bluebox analysis identified server-side security issues, including that the ToyTalk server domain was on a cloud infrastructure susceptible to the POODLE attack — an exploit that takes advantage of the way some browsers deal with encryption. This would allow attackers to downgrade connection security and listen in on communications to the server such as uploaded conversations from the doll. Bluebox informed ToyTalk of these vulnerabilities, and the company has quickly resolved several issues, according to the white paper. ####  ##### Bluebox wasn't the first to identify a security flaw with Hello Barbie. Researcher Matt Jakubowski previously said he'd discovered a flaw that would potentially allow hackers to pinpoint home addresses of doll owners. ####  ##### Barbie isn't the only toy that's run into safety or privacy concerns related to its Internet connection. Hackers recently stole the account information of more than 6.4 million children who use the Learning Lodge app store for VTech Holdings Ltd. toys. #### "
"McDonald's charged by EEOC after canceling interview for deaf job-seeker","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### McDonald’s Corp. has been charged with disability discrimination by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for refusing to provide a sign language interpreter for a deaf employee candidate. ####  ##### Ricky Washington, who is deaf, applied online for a job at a McDonald’s restaurant in Belton, Missouri, in June 2012. When the Belton restaurant manager learned Mr. Washington needed a sign language interpreter for his job interview, she canceled the interview and never rescheduled it, despite Mr. Washington’s sister volunteering to act as the interpreter, the EEOC said in a statement issued Monday. ####  ##### Mr. Washington indicated on his application that he attended Kansas School for the Deaf and that he also had previous job experience working as a cook and clean-up team member at a McDonald's restaurant in Louisiana in 2009. ####  ##### Restaurant management continued to interview and hire new workers after Mr. Washington made several attempts to schedule an interview, according to the agency. ####  ##### After first attempting to reach a prelitigation settlement through its conciliation process, the EEOC charged Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s Corp. and McDonald’s Restaurants of Missouri Inc. in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Missouri, with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by refusing to accommodate and hire a deaf applicant. ####  ##### “Removing obstacles in the hiring process for people with disabilities is a national priority for EEOC,” said James R. Neely Jr., EEOC’s St. Louis district director. “All employers, but especially large ones, should join with the agency to make sure everyone has equal access to the employment process.” ####  ##### The Belton restaurant where Mr. Washington applied for work is owned and operated by McDonald’s Corp., the statement said. #### "
"Hillshire Brands to pay $4 million to settle race bias case","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### Hillshire Brands Co., formerly known as Sara Lee Corp., has agreed to pay $4 million to settle a race discrimination suit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency said Tuesday. ####  ##### The EEOC claimed that from August 2001 to November 2011, African-American employees in the former Sara Lee facility in Paris, Texas, were subjected to racist graffiti on the walls of the bathrooms and locker room, the agency said in a statement. Former bakery employees also alleged that during work hours they were berated with racial slurs by supervisors and other white co-workers, and that complaints by the plant workers went unaddressed by management. ####  ##### The EEOC filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Marshall, Texas, in July alleging race discrimination in the workplace, including race harassment. ####  ##### “The Commission completed an extensive investigation at the Sara Lee plant, which included conducting interviews with the former bakery workers,” Meaghan L. Shepard, trial attorney for the EEOC’s Dallas district, said in the statement. “EEOC determined racial slurs and graffiti continued at the facility in Paris for years, until the doors finally closed in November 2011.” ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement, in addition to paying $4 million, the company agreed to implement various preventive approaches regarding discrimination or harassment against any employee on the basis of race and will periodically report incidents or investigations to the EEOC. Hillshire Brands also agreed to engage in remedial measures such as anti-discrimination training and implementation of procedures to prevent and promptly address graffiti issues, according to the statement. ####  ##### “African-American workers on the Sara Lee bakery production lines in Paris felt embarrassed and intimidated by the graffiti in the bathroom and the racial slurs on the production floor,” Suzanne Anderson, EEOC’s supervisory trial attorney, said in the statement. “Strong corporate policies and quick remedial action protects against this type of workplace discrimination.” ####  ##### Sara Lee was renamed Hillshire Brands in a 2012 corporate restructuring. #### "

"Major event needed to disrupt pricing status quo","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, P/C Pricing"," ##### What would it take to turn the commercial property insurance market, which is now in its third year of rate cuts? ####  ##### Maybe more than just a single event, according to observers. ####  ##### “It's going to take a major unexpected event or events to change the market,” said Joe Tinetti, Zurich North America's New York-based head of property for global corporate in North America. ####  ##### And how big would that event or series of events need to be? ####  ##### “We're calling for an event we've never seen,” such as an “outrageous California” earthquake or a direct hit on Miami by a Category 5 hurricane, said Dave Finnis, national property practice leader at Willis North America Inc. in Atlanta. ####  ##### “The markets that pay that loss have to take corrective action against a market loss that hadn't been experience before,” he said. ####  ##### He said that underwriters that don't pay for the loss, should it happen, “will see that as an opportunity to pounce,” which in turn would temper any increase from the market. ####  ##### Mr. Finnis said that an event that occurred outside of the property insurance market could also change the marketplace. ####  ##### “Something that really takes a hit on the balance sheets of all the companies, like a huge cyber event,” he said. ####  ##### Hedge fund activity is driving the cheap reinsurance available to the property insurance market, said Mike Martin, executive vice president and general manager of national insurance property at Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. in Boston. He said if the hedge funds decide to put their money into other investments, the hedge fund money would disappear. #### "
"Little urgency expected in Congress","Risk Management","Catastrophes"," ##### There looks to be a limited risk management-related agenda at the congressional level this year. ####  ##### That's not because of the relative merits of issues such as reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program or dealing with international insurance regulatory initiatives. Rather, it's the political reality of national elections and a short legislative calendar. ####  ##### “We have to be realistic about a presidential election year, particularly one like this one with divided Congress and administration,” said Joel Wood, senior vice president of the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers in Washington. “I do not believe there will be a vast agenda.” ####  ##### But for Mr. Wood and others, there still could be significant actions on both the legislative and regulatory fronts. Observers expect a congressional discussion about international insurance regulatory efforts, and perhaps some movement on allowing certain risk retention groups to offer property coverage. ####  ##### Perhaps the biggest risk management-related issue will be laying the groundwork for the reauthorization of the NFIP, which is slated to expire Sept. 30, 2017. ####  ##### There will be “a lot of motion and maybe some action” on NFIP reauthorization, said Nat Wienecke, senior vice president in the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America's Washington office. The program will be the subject of a series of hearings in 2016. ####  ##### There will be “basically a yearlong conversation,” he said. “I don't expect legislation to be introduced. ####  ##### “We're already seeing preparation by all the major stakeholders in NFIP,” said Mr. Wood. “Barring any major flood event, we still are going to see a very significant battle on this.” ####  ##### He said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, and Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., “will light themselves on fire before they lift the borrowing limits in the absence of significant actuarially sound reform” of the program. ####  ##### Related to the NFIP is legislation that would promote predisaster mitigation efforts rather than post-catastrophe relief. ####  ##### “We've been calling on Congress to create a national mitigation investment strategy. I think we'll see a package introduced that is a good first step” in dedicating more resources to be spent predisaster, said Jimi Grande, senior vice president of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Cos. Washington office. ####  ##### Mr. Wood said allowing RRGs to write property coverage “may go somewhere.” ####  ##### But Charles Symington, senior vice president of the Alexandria, Virginia-based Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, said his group opposes such a move for RRGs, which now are limited to liability coverage. ####  ##### “There's no marketplace crisis, and we think it's bad public policy in light of the very light regulation RRGs have compared to traditional insurers,” he said. ####  ##### The New York-based Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. wishes to block another legislative effort. That's an attempt disallow the deduction for excess nontaxed reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., has introduced legislation in the past to make the change, which is backed by the Obama administration. ####  ##### “The legislation has come and gone over the years, and we continue to be opposed to it,” said Janice Ochenkowski, a former RIMS president and now chair of the risk management group's external affairs committee. “We're concerned it might gain some traction in this shortened year.” ####  ##### Several observers believe Congress may address the issue of international insurance regulation during this shortened legislative year. ####  ##### “We're seeing very strong signs of congressional actions to rebalance some of the international and domestic actions on insurance regulations,” said Dave Snyder, a PCI vice president. His colleague, Mr. Wienecke, said concerns about international standards being imposed on U.S. insurers are “as bipartisan as they can be.” ####  ##### On the regulatory side, “the work by the Federal Reserve on domestic group capital standards has to get done,” said Leigh Ann Pusey, president and CEO of the American Insurance Association in Washington. ####  ##### “There is an expectation that the Fed will begin a process and put out a rule for comment,” she said. “It needs to get done before any global insurance capital standard is finalized.” ####  ##### Also of concern to agents and brokers on the regulatory side is implementation of the National Association of Registered Agents & Brokers, which is to streamline licensing procedures for nonresident agents, said Mr. Symington. President Barack Obama has yet to nominate members to the board. ####  ##### “We're hopeful that early next year we'll have some names put forth for Senate consideration so they can start the real work, a lot of foundational work. First and foremost, we have to get the right people on that board,” Mr. Symington said. #### "

"Operating margins, technology to drive insurer trends in 2016","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, P/C Pricing, Technology"," ##### Insurers will see margin pressure in 2016, and technology will continue to take center stage, according to a report released Monday by S&P Capital IQ. ####  ##### With the exception of life insurers, which saw margins expand 138 basis points to 9.68%, year-to-date operating margins for most insurers contracted through Sept. 30, said the New York-based division of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., citing data from SNL Financial L.C. Hardest hit were multiline insurers, where operating margins were down 196 basis points to 10.46%. ####  ##### This could force insurers to pare business, said the report, “Marketscope Advisor Trends & Ideas: Insurance Predictions for 2016.” ####  ##### “Many insurers may be forced to conclude that a broad-based product and segment strategy is no longer a viable business model. Many will trim product offerings, selling or running off noncore and underperforming lines of business,” S&P Capital IQ said in its report. ####  ##### Technology will continue to have a substantial impact on the industry. ####  ##### While “The insurance industry remains heavily dependent on third-party intermediaries — agents and brokers — to market and distribute their products,” S&P Capital IQ notes in its report that “a growing number of consumers prefer to research products and make purchases online,” meaning that the “degree to which an insurer is able to meet these shifts in purchasing trends will be a key competitive factor.” ####  ##### Technology will also affect competition, S&P Capital IQ said. ####  ##### “Tech innovations like Policy Genius and Google Compare, shopping sites which allow consumers to compare policies, are two examples. While these sites may help insurers increase their online presence, they also serve to further commoditize insurance products,” the report said. #### "

The suit accuses Trader Joe's of underfilling 5-ounce cans of its store-brand tuna, which is in violation of the federally mandated minimum standard fill of 3.23 ounces for these cans, said court documents. ####  ##### According to government standards, a 5-ounce can of tuna must contain at least 3.23 ounces of meat (or 2.84 ounces, in the case of Skipjack tuna). But Trader Joe's canned tuna weighed in at an average of roughly 17% below the federally mandated minimums across six tested store brand varieties. ####  ##### Tests by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed the cans had an average of only about 2.43 ounces to 2.87 ounces of tuna, depending on the tuna version, according to court documents.

"Zurich Insurance poaches Generali chief Mario Greco","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Zurich, Italy, Switzerland"," ##### (Reuters) — Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. has poached Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. CEO Mario Greco in a move the Swiss insurer hopes will revive its fortunes and which leaves its Italian rival searching for a worthy successor. ####  ##### Underscoring the challenges awaiting Mr. Greco after he engineered a rapid turnaround at Generali, Zurich issued a profit warning last week for its general insurance business, its second in four months. ####  ##### ""Like many global players, the company has faced market challenges in recent times but I know that Zurich's strong global franchise, the breadth of talent and the powerful brand provide all of the ingredients for our future success,"" Mr. Greco said in a statement announcing his appointment as CEO at Zurich. ####  ##### A source had said Mr. Greco's decision to leave Generali was due to personal reasons and not to differences with shareholders of the Italian insurer. Regardless, Bernstein analyst Thomas Seidl said his departure was bad news for Generali. ####  ##### ""The market liked Greco and that helped mitigate the downside for the shares. Now there's room for the stock to fall closer to its €13 ($14) fair value,"" Mr. Seidl said. ####  ##### Generali shares closed down 3.15% at €14.15 ($15.28) on Tuesday, while Zurich shares rose 0.6%. ####  ##### Speculation that Mr. Greco might move to Zurich has been bubbling since mid-December. He ran the Swiss company's main general insurance business before joining Generali in August 2012 and will return as chief executive on May 1. ####  ##### Mr. Greco's return to Zurich had been reported earlier by Reuters. ####  ##### Turnaround architect ####  ##### Zurich had looked at external candidates for the CEO spot to replace Martin Senn, who quit on Dec. 1 following a failed takeover bid for Britain's RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. Chairman Tom de Swaan had held the role on an interim basis. ####  ##### Mr. Greco, who started his career at consultancy firm McKinsey & Co., took over at Generali at the height of the eurozone debt crisis after a boardroom coup ousted his predecessor. ####  ##### The 56-year-old executive, a competitive road cyclist in his free time, is widely seen as the architect of a rapid turnaround that helped almost double the insurer's share price. ####  ##### Under his stewardship, Generali sold assets worth €4 billion ($4.32 billion), cut costs and bolstered capital ahead of new, tougher European solvency rules. ####  ##### Generali, 13.5% owned by influential investment bank Mediobanca, will have to find a successor to steer it through solvency capital requirements which kicked in this year. ####  ##### ""Generali's capital situation remains unclear and weak relative to peers. We have always argued that Mario Greco should have raised capital right at the start,"" Mr. Seidl said. ####  ##### A source said the process to find a successor to Greco had started with the insurer looking inside and outside the group. ####  ##### Generali said its board would meet soon over the matter. #### "
"Zurich addresses losses, but planned changes may not be enough","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Zurich, United Kingdom"," ##### Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.'s nonlife underwriting results likely will remain under pressure as the insurer continues to make changes to address a string of recent losses, analysts say. ####  ##### Zurich last week announced that it expected to report a $100 million loss in its nonlife division for the fourth quarter of 2015. ####  ##### The insurer said that based on preliminary estimates, it expects to report losses of about $275 million from three storms that hit the United Kingdom and Ireland in December, as well as large losses from other natural catastrophe and accident-year claims. ####  ##### It said that its general insurance unit likely would report a $100 million loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 and said that it had accelerated a cost saving drive. ####  ##### In a briefing note on Monday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it expected Zurich's underwriting results to remain under pressure this year. ####  ##### “Zurich is also reducing expenses, but the benefits to net income will be offset by restructuring costs,” the New York-based rating agency said. ####  ##### Moody's said it expects Zurich to incur further restructuring charges in 2016. ####  ##### “These headwinds will come in addition to the low interest rates, which push investment income downwards and led Zurich to write off around $230 million of goodwill related to its German life business,” Moody's said. ####  ##### “The persistent occurrence of large losses that have affected Zurich's performance during the year continues to generate concerns about the extent of the problems underpinning the general insurance segment and the effectiveness of Zurich's underwriting risk management framework,” rating agency A.M. Best Co. Inc. said Monday in a briefing note. ####  ##### “Given the short term nature of the affected contracts, a material improvement in technical results is anticipated during 2016 and beyond, although A.M. Best recognises that remedial actions taken to restore profitability are expected to take time to materialize into a better quality insurance portfolio,” the Oldwick, New Jersey-based rating agency said. ####  ##### Recent changes to manage structure mean that there may be execution risk associated with the company's turnaround plans, Best added. ####  ##### Sami Taipalus, an analyst at Berenberg Bank A.G. in London, said Zurich's general insurance business likely will remain weak in 2016 and 2017. ####  ##### In a Thursday note to investors, Mr. Taipalus said given that many of the general insurance problems are related to “one-off events,” Zurich's management “appears to have concluded that the issues it faces can be managed through rate increases, selective re-underwriting and an acceleration of ongoing cost-cutting.” ####  ##### But he said Berenberg questions this approach for three reasons: “the persistence of recent adverse large loss experience implies issues with the group's underwriting protocol; reserve development has been choppy for some time, suggesting thin margins; and the 94% combined ratio reported for the bulk of general insurance at nine months benefitted materially from favorable natural catastrophe losses.” ####  ##### “These issues require more fundamental change than that planned for Zurich in 2016 and could even by aggravated by too aggressive cost-cutting,” he said. #### "

Andrew Cuomo has tapped Maria Vullo, a New York lawyer and former staffer, as the state's top financial regulator, his office said Thursday. ####  ##### The nomination of Ms. Vullo as superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services comes more than eight months after the May 2015 departure of former superintendent Benjamin Lawsky. ####  ##### Ms. Vullo, a litigator from New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison L.L.P., also served as executive deputy attorney general for economic justice in 2010 under Gov. Cuomo, a Democrat, who was then New York state attorney general. ####  ##### Ms. Vullo could not immediately be reached for comment but issued a statement through Gov. Cuomo's office. ""I look forward to working with the talented men and women at DFS to strengthen our markets and protect investors and consumers from unlawful business practices,"" she said. ####  ##### Her nomination must be confirmed by the New York Legislature. ####  ##### The NYDFS has been in flux since Mr. Lawsky's departure, cycling through two acting superintendents. ####  ##### In October 2015, NYDFS Acting Superintendent Anthony Albanese resigned amid a dispute with Gov. Cuomo's administration, which had sought to approve any subpoenas the regulator intended to issue, according to media reports. ####  ##### Mr. Albanese remained with the agency until December 2015, when Shirin Emami, general counsel of NYDFS' banking division, became acting superintendent. ####  ##### Gov. Cuomo and New York's legislature created the NYDFS in 2011 by consolidating the state's banking and insurance agencies. The idea was to modernize regulation through a single agency that would oversee a broader array of financial products and services, the administration has said. ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky, the agency's first head, grabbed headlines in 2012 when he threatened to revoke Standard Chartered P.L.C.'s license to operate in New York after accusing the London-based bank of hiding $250 billion of Iran-linked transactions from regulators. ####  ##### Using a banking license as public leverage was an unusual move, creating an uproar that swept across the Atlantic and paving the way for a quick $340 million settlement between Standard Chartered and Mr. Lawsky. ####  ##### Other U.S. authorities, who were conducting a joint probe into Standard Chartered's sanctions-related violations, did not take kindly to Mr. Lawsky's going it alone. But the move drove home the agency's willingness to wield its power. ####  ##### Since then, the regulator has been widely perceived as an aggressive enforcer. It has made its mark in other landmark agreements with foreign banks over sanctions and tax-related violations, forcing resignations, record-breaking fines and other reforms. #### "

"HSBC to pay $470 million to resolve mortgage servicing probe","Risk Management","United Kingdom, D&O, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — HSBC Holdings P.L.C. will pay $470 million to settle parallel U.S. federal and state civil charges alleging the bank's mortgage servicing arm engaged in abusive foreclosure and loan origination practices, the New York attorney general's office said Friday. ####  ##### The mortgage settlement resolves claims brought against the London-based bank by the U.S. Justice Department, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and 49 states plus the District of Columbia. ####  ##### The New York attorney general's office said the HSBC accord largely mirrored a 2012 national mortgage settlement that federal and state officials struck with five of the country's largest banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ####  ##### The national mortgage settlement came in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 housing crisis, when many people lost their homes to foreclosure. ####  ##### The mortgage servicing investigation started after evidence emerged late in 2010 that banks had robo-signed thousands of foreclosure documents without properly reviewing paperwork. ####  ##### The HSBC agreement requires the company to provide various types of relief to mortgage holders, such as principal reductions and refinancing for underwater mortgages. ####  ##### Some borrowers who may have been harmed by the bank's mortgage servicing practices may also be eligible to receive payments through a national $59.3 million fund. ####  ##### HSBC also needs to undertake certain corrective actions. ####  ##### For instance, it must not foreclose on homeowners being considered for a loan modification and must give those people a chance to appeal denials. ####  ##### HSBC must also install an independent monitor to review compliance with the settlement, which will be entered into a federal court in Washington, D.C. ####  ##### ""There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes lenders who engage in abusive business practices,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. ####  ##### His office said New York had about 136,000 borrowers who may be eligible to reap the financial benefits from Friday's settlement. HSBC serviced the loans of these borrowers, who later lost their homes between 2008 and 2012. #### "
"Small captive owners face specific rules to prevent IRS scrutiny","Risk Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, P/C Legislation & Regulation"," ##### BOCA RATON, Fla. — Legislation passed in 2015 that changed the requirements for how small captives are allowed to be structured will create lots of work for managers and lawyers into the next year, a captive expert predicts. ####  ##### The Protecting America From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, signed into law in December, changed section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code by increasing the maximum in premiums for small captive insurers to $2.2 million and adding a requirement to meet one of two diversification tests. All changes go into effect in 2017. ####  ##### The diversification tests came about after “voluminous captive audits,” were held and for the first time ever the IRS linked 831(b) captives with tax shelters, labeling captives as part of the “Dirty Dozen,” said David Snowball, Salt Lake City-based director of captive insurance for Utah, while speaking Tuesday at the 2016 World Captive Forum in Boca Raton, Florida. However, “just because the IRS is investigating doesn't mean anyone did anything wrong,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Snowball explained the diversification tests in examples of captive structures that would and would not meet one of the two tests. “The first diversification test is for when you have multiple insurers,” he said. “Not one of them can pay more than 20% of the premium from any one policy holder.” ####  ##### As an example, if a captive is structured where 12 corporations insured with a group captive that is owned by 12 unrelated people, each of them is going to pay 8.33% of the premium. This captive meets the diversity test and can elect section 831(b), he said. ####  ##### If one of the 12 people in the captive owned three corporations while the other 11 people in the captive each owned one corporation, then the one person owning three corporations would pay more than 20% of the premiums and the captive would not qualify to elect 831(b), he said. ####  ##### “Test 2 is for when related family members share ownership of the captive. Here, any one family member can't own more of the captive than they own in the operating company,” Mr. Snowball said. ####  ##### So if a father owned 70% of a business and 70% of a captive and the son owned 30% of that business and 30% of that captive, then the captive is eligible to make an election under section 831(b), he said. ####  ##### But if the son, instead of owning 30% of the captive owned 100%, then the captive is not eligible for the 831(b) election. ####  ##### Mr. Snowball estimates there are close to 5,000 small captives that can take advantage of the 831(b) election. They can also take advantage of the tax benefit and the insurance benefit of being a small captive, he said. ####  ##### “This has nothing to do with the definition of insurance; it only tells you who gets to be elected (for 831b), and if you do not, then you will be taxed under 831(a), which is how other insurance companies are taxed,” Mr. Snowball said. #### "

"Privacy vs. security at heart of Apple iPhone decrypt order","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, Regulation, Risk Management, Terrorism, Political Risk, Claims Disputes, Emerging Risks, General liability, Technology"," ##### (Reuters) — A court order demanding that Apple Inc. help the U.S. government unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is shaping up as a crucial test case of how far the government can go in forcing technology companies to help security and intelligence investigations. ####  ##### Law enforcement agencies have for years faced off against tech firms and privacy advocates over their ability to monitor digital communications, and the government to date has largely lost the battle. ####  ##### But the specific circumstances of the San Bernardino case, a young married couple who sympathized with Islamic State militants and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting rampage at a holiday party, could give government officials the legal precedent they need to reverse the tide. ####  ##### A federal judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide ""reasonable technical assistance"" to investigators seeking to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the shootings. ####  ##### The government argues that the iPhone is a crucial piece of evidence. But civil liberties groups warn that forcing companies to crack their own encryption endangers the technical integrity of the Internet and threatens not just the privacy of customers but potentially that of citizens of any country. ####  ##### On Wednesday, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates came out strongly on the side of law enforcement, raising the possibility of another legislative effort to require tech companies to put ""backdoors"" in their products. ####  ##### White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Department of Justice was asking Apple for access to just one device, a central part of the government's argument, which Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said was ""simply not true."" ####  ##### ""They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,"" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing. ####  ##### The Department of Justice stressed in a statement on Wednesday that its request was ""narrowly tailored,"" and chided Apple. ""It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil."" ####  ##### Most technology security experts, including many who have served in government, have said technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes. ####  ##### ""The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,"" Cook said in a statement on Tuesday. ""But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices."" ####  ##### Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai endorsed Cook's stance in tweets on Wednesday. ####  ##### ""We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders,"" he wrote. ""But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent."" ####  ##### Legal Fight ####  ##### Representatives of several tech companies did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling. Not surprisingly, however, trade groups that count thousands of software companies, smartphone makers and network security firms as members decried the government's position, while law enforcement groups backed the Justice Department. ####  ##### The industry was ""committed to working with law enforcement to keep Americans safe,"" the Software & Information Industry Association said, but in the Apple case, ""the government's position is overbroad and unwise."" ####  ##### The Computing Technology Industry Association said if the order was carried out, ""it could give the FBI the power to call for some sort of back end to encryption whenever they see fit."" ####  ##### If the federal judge, Magistrate Sheri Pym, rejects Apple's arguments, the Cupertino, California-based company can appeal her order to the district court, and then up the chain to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### The 9th Circuit is known to be pro-privacy. ""The government ultimately will have an uphill fight,"" said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises companies on cyber security issues. ####  ##### Farook was assigned the phone by the county health department for which he worked, prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday. The health department had ""given its consent"" to authorities to search the device and to Apple to assist investigators in that search, the document said. ####  ##### San Bernardino County's top prosecutor, District Attorney Mike Ramos, said Apple's refusal to unlock the phone was a slap in the face to the victims of the shooting and their families. ####  ##### ""They'd like to know details like any of us in America would like to know. Were there other threats? Were there other individuals involved?"" Ramos said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### 'Master Key' ####  ##### Dan Guido, an expert in hacking operating systems, said that to unlock the phone, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would need to install an update to Apple's iOS operating system so investigators could circumvent the security protections, including one that wipes data if an incorrect password is entered too many times. ####  ##### He said only Apple could provide that software because the phones will only install updates that are digitally signed with a secret cryptographic key. ####  ##### ""That key is one of the most valuable pieces of data the entire company owns,"" he said. ""Someone with that key can change all the data on all the iPhones."" ####  ##### The notion of providing that key is anathema to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online rights group. ""Once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well,"" the foundation said in a statement. ####  ##### Lance James, an expert in forensics who is chief scientist with cyber intelligence company Flashpoint, said Apple could respond to the order without providing crypto keys or specialized tools that could be used to unlock other phones. ####  ##### Apple technicians could create software that would unlock the phone, allowing the company to create a backup file with all of its contents that they could provide to law enforcement, James said. ####  ##### American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Alex Abdo said the government's request risked a ""dangerous"" precedent.

"Hospital pays ransom in bitcoins to restore computer systems","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, Technology"," ##### A Los Angeles hospital has agreed to pay the equivalent of $17,000 in bitcoins to restore control of its computer systems, in a “ransomware” incident. ####  ##### Allen Stefanek, president and CEO of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a private 434-bed facility, said in a statement Wednesday that on Feb. 5, the hospital staff noticed problems accessing the hospital's computer network, and an investigation by its information technology department determined it had been subject to a malware attack. ####  ##### “The malware locked access to certain computer systems and prevented us from sharing communications electronically,” said the statement. ####  ##### According to news reports, doctors at the hospital were forced to rely on telephones and fax machines to relay patient information, and communications between physicians and staff were bogged down by paper records and difficulty deciphering doctors' handwriting. There were also reports that ambulances had been diverted from the hospital. ####  ##### The hospital received a ransom demand of 40 bitcoins, which is the equivalent of about $17,000, to obtain the decryption key to unlock the system, and paid it. ####  ##### “The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. In the best interest of restoring normal operations we did this,” said Mr. Stefanek's statement. ####  ##### He said the hospital has restored its electronic medical record system as of Monday. “All clinical operations are utilizing the (electronic medical record) system,” said the statement. “All systems currently in use were cleared of the malware and thoroughly tested. We continue to work with our team of experts to understand more about this event.” ####  ##### The statement said also: “Patient care has not been compromised in any way. Further, we have no evidence at this time that any patient or employee information was subject to unauthorized access.” ####  ##### A hospital spokeswoman had no further comment. ####  ##### In October, Cisco Systems Inc. said it had managed to disrupt the spread of one of the most pernicious systems for infecting Internet users with malicious software such as ransomware. ####  ##### A Singapore-based chief security officer for Microsoft Asia, a unit of Microsoft Corp., predicted in December 2014 that while at that point ransomware had largely been confined to Australia, it would appear elsewhere as well. #### "
"Aon alleges construction group poaching by Alliant ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Aon, Construction, General liability"," ##### A federal judge in Chicago has issued a temporary restraining order forbidding Alliant Insurance Services Inc. from soliciting Aon construction services group employees and clients. ####  ##### The ruling is the latest in disputes between Aon and Alliant about alleged poaching. ####  ##### In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Aon alleged that former executive Michael Heffernan resigned abruptly from Aon; immediately joined Newport Beach, California-based Alliant; and that he helped hire away 26 of the 31 employees at Aon's San Jose, California, office. ####  ##### Alliant announced earlier this month that Mr. Heffernan  had joined it as vice president of its construction services group in San Jose. ####  ##### In her Feb. 10 ruling in Aon P.L.C. v. Michael Heffernan et al., U.S. District Court Judge Andrea R. Wood approved the temporary restraining order, saying Aon had “demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, starting with the choice of which state's law should apply.” ####  ##### Although Alliant argued the case should be heard in California, “plaintiffs have presented a sufficient legal and factual argument in favor of Illinois law to support the likelihood of success on the merits of their claims,” Judge Wood ruled. ####  ##### The order states also that Aon has presented evidence that it maintains a proprietary database of customer information,and that while Mr. Heffernan did not typically use it, “he accessed it for an extended period” when he began to discuss future employment with Alliant. ####  ##### Aon's suit accuses Mr. Heffernan of breach of noncompete agreements and breach of his fiduciary duties. Aside from barring Alliant from soliciting any employee or client of Aon's, the judge also ordered Mr. Heffernan and others not to disclose any of Aon's information and return information from its proprietary database to Aon. ####  ##### An Alliant spokesman could not be reached for comment. ####  ##### A status hearing has been set for Feb. 22 in the case. ####  ##### In another  poaching dispute between Aon and Alliant, a New York appellate court in 2013  forbade Alliant Senior Managing Director Peter Arkley, formerly CEO of Aon's construction operations, from soliciting business from any former Aon client for the two years prior to June 13, 2011. #### "

L.L.C. effective this May, while his brother David, formerly an executive vice president, left Willis Re in August 2015. ####  ##### In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Willis Towers Watson accuses the Hearns of breach of contract, unjust enrichment and conversion for retention awards they were given during their time with Willis Re. ####  ##### Willis alleges that, according to their respective employment contracts that paid Peter Hearn an award of  $1.75 million each year in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and David Hearn $525,000 to $675,000 a year during that period, they agreed to repay the performance awards should they leave Willis before the end of their contracts. ####  ##### Willis Towers Watson alleges the men have thus far refused to repay their portions of the awards. ####  ##### “Willis Towers Watson is currently pursuing legal redress for breach of contract. We will always defend our rights robustly and will pursue cases vigorously where we believe action is necessary to vindicate the company's rights,” a Willis Towers Watson spokeswoman said Tuesday in an email to Business Insurance. ####  ##### Willis Towers Watson is seeking approximately $2.8 million in damages from Peter Hearn and approximately $800,000 from David Hearn. ####  ##### Guy Carpenter, a Marsh & McLennan Cos.

"Feds try to clarify joint employer status","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, General liability"," ##### The Department of Labor's wage and hour division and the National Labor Relations Board have weighed in on the issue of joint employment and employers' potential liability under federal law. ####  ##### The Labor Department's Jan. 20 guidance, “Joint Employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act and Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act,” says that joint employment can be either “horizontal” or “vertical.” ####  ##### Horizontal employment “should be considered when an employee is employed by two (or more) technically separate but related or overlapping employers,” such as separate restaurants that share economic ties, says the guidance. ####  ##### Vertical joint employment situations happen when the “employee of the intermediary employer is also employed by another employer,” which would include staffing agencies, for instance. ####  ##### Determining whether an employee has more than one employer is important in determining employer rights and obligations under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the agricultural worker act, says the guidance. ####  ##### Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board last year held in Browning-Ferris of California Inc. that a company need have only indirect control of a worker and does not need to exercise that control to be considered a joint employer. ####  ##### The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also made rulings on the issue. ####  ##### For instance, in EEOC v. Skanska USA Building Inc., which later was settled in January 2015 for $95,000, the agency successfully argued before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati that the joint employer concept could be applied to New York-based Skanska in a case involving a subcontractor. #### "
"Underwriters get ready for crewless ships","Risk Management","Risk Management, Marine"," ##### Autonomous ships are being explored by the cargo industry, giving marine insurers about five years to determine the costs of covering a crewless ship for risks that can occur at sea. ####  ##### And the lack of historical data typical of any new technology is complicating the process of underwriting the risks of unmanned ships. ####  ##### “As insurers, we need to get data,” said Andrew Kinsey, a former ship's captain and now a New York-based senior marine consultant at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty S.E. ####  ##### “We need a method to safely and effectively implement unmanned vessels and get the data we need,” Mr. Kinsey said. He suggested a convoy scenario, where several unmanned vessels would be chaperoned by a manned vessel, “riding herd, like a sheepdog,” he said. ####  ##### An autonomous vessel would be best suited to replace dry-bulk carriers that operate in intercontinental trade, according to three-year research project Maritime Unmanned Navigation through Intelligence Networks, as these ships travel slowly, transporting cargo such as timber or steel in long, uninterrupted ocean voyages. ####  ##### “The insurance industry has been at the forefront of most pioneering projects now covering drones, satellite launches, satellites in orbit, test flights, remotely controlled underwater vehicles and a number of other automated products,” Sean Woollerson, London-based senior partner at JLT Specialty Ltd., said in an email. “But a vessel being operated remotely from onshore will bring unique challenges in the developing of a fully automated complex key component for the supply chain.” ####  ##### Those challenges include pirates, a fire at sea and the time involved to reach the ship if a computer malfunctions. ####  ##### Alan Jervis, founder of Marine, Transportation and Energy Insurance Experts, a consultant to the worldwide insurance, risk management, shipping and transportation industries based in Toronto, points out that a ship is different than other vehicles that may operate autonomously. For one, a cargo ship will be isolated on the ocean. “One of the duties of the crew is to ensure the cargo is inspected, that it doesn't leak or break through and cause a fire,” Mr. Jervis said. ####  ##### Shipping services provider Clarkson P.L.C. puts the number of cargo ships operating now at 9,600. Though none are unmanned, crewless smaller vessels are expected to be in use in three to five years, with larger merchant ships, those carrying oil and heavier cargo, arriving in 10 to 15 years, according to the Royal Institute of Naval Architects, a London-based professional organization whose members work in the design, construction, maintenance and operation of marine vessels and structures. ####  ##### Europe is prime territory for their use, facing issues such as increased cargo volume and environmental requirements and a decline in the number of sailors. So the Europe Commission funded the three-year MUNIN research project to investigate the possibilities of unmanned ships. ####  ##### MUNIN, completed in August 2015, used 10 years of global manned ship data to compare risks of manned ships to those of unmanned ships and projected that an unmanned ship would have one-tenth of the risk of a manned ship in foundering and collision, in which human error often plays a role. The analysis also predicted a savings of $7 million over a 25-year period per ship in fuel use and crew supplies and salaries. ####  ##### “This is less about pros and cons of a crew and more about how insurers can analyze risk,” Tom Hoad, London-based head of innovation at Tokio Marine Kiln Group Ltd., said in an email. ####  ##### “Undoubtedly one of the benefits is that better informatics means that insurers might be in a better position to calculate risk,” Mr. Hoad said of the advanced modeling tools risk managers use to determine risk. “Perhaps one of the downsides, though, is the question of what new risk emerges from not having a crew.” ####  ##### To Mr. Jervis, liability and a credible backup plan if something goes wrong at sea would be paramount to cover the millions of dollars of cargo generally on ships. “There wouldn't be anyone there if there was a breakdown of the computer systems,” Mr. Jervis said. “You could have a train break down in the city of Chicago and a crew could come in minutes, but the Atlantic can be a one-week voyage and the Pacific two to three weeks.” ####  ##### When it comes to drone technology in any line of transportation, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. “Insurers have to look at every risk on a case-by-case basis and decide what the individual threats are,” Mr. Hoad said. ####  ##### Typically insurers calculate risk by comparing the known volatility of a similar class to the new one, he said. For example, light aircraft gave the industry more data about unmanned aerial vehicles. ####  ##### But vessels have unique risks, such as pirates. Although the Royal Institute of Naval Architects considers pirates to be “virtually a nonissue for fully unmanned ships,” it cites the lack of crew to take hostage and the ease of creating control systems that cannot be operated by nonauthorized personnel. “Pirates would need an ocean-going tug to steal the ship or cargo,” the organization said in a January statement. ####  ##### With 23 years in the Merchant Marines, including 13 as captain of five vessels, Mr. Kinsey disputes that, saying an unmanned vessel at sea would be at higher risk of piracy. ####  ##### Speaking from experience with pirates, he said: “I believe that a human presence on board with active piracy measures in place is an effective deterrent to a pirate boarding.” #### "
"Risk managers missing out on big data opportunities","Risk Management","Risk Management, Technology, Risk Management Insurance Panel"," ##### The market may still not be ready for all the sophisticated functionalities that technology companies have to offer risk managers, a Business Insurance survey concludes. ####  ##### According to Business Insurance's Risk Management Insights Panel, which comprises risk managers in industries that include construction, transportation, real estate and health care, 97% are the final decision-makers or actively participate in their organization's insurance purchases. ####  ##### The online survey, which drew 184 responses, found that 65% of respondents are light to moderate users of risk management information systems. Twenty-eight percent say they do not use RMIS at their company at all. ####  ##### Risk management professionals also are not jumping on the big data bandwagon, as only 5% of survey respondents said they currently use big data in their modeling efforts. ####  ##### About one-fifth of the total still rely on spreadsheets. ####  ##### Amid cyber breaches, geopolitical problems around the world and financial market turmoil, 69% do feel that risk management today is a higher priority in their organization than it was two years ago. ####  ##### The top five risks about which their organizations are most concerned are operational, regulatory, legal, data/cyber and reputational risks, according to the survey. ####  ##### For the 72% of risk managers that do have RMIS, managing and monitoring workers compensation claims is the top thing that today's technology allows that was not available in the past. ####  ##### Managing risk and insurance, producing detailed internal reports, capturing and analyzing risk data and improving risk analysis round out the top five uses of RMIS by today's risk managers. That is nearly the same as Business Insurance's previous risk manager survey in 2014. ####  ##### But when it comes to challenges the risk managers expect to face in the next 12 to 24 months, collecting and analyzing data is not the biggest issue. ####  ##### Members of the Risk Management Insights Panel say their three biggest concerns in the next two years are getting business units to collaborate on risk management initiatives, developing a risk culture within the organization and aligning their tolerance of risk with the company's overall business strategy. ####  ##### Improving risk measurement, forecasting and modeling is No. 4 among their future concerns, while No. 5 is making risk management a key priority for executive leadership. ####  ##### As far as RMIS and other technology, risk managers' top desire is that it be able to forecast risks, followed by relating risks and processes, conducting risk and other business analysis, quantifying risks and risk assessments. ####  ##### That means risk technology companies may want to increase the sophistication and functionality of their offerings, but also put equal emphasis on making their systems easier to use, considering the time lag in risk management's adoption of new technology. ####  ##### That could help with companies' generally flat spending on new tech tools. ####  ##### Sixty-five percent of the respondents said there has been no increase in technology investment in the past year. Still, the 33% that did increase technology spending in the past year said it increased by 10% to more than 50%. ####  ##### The average spending on new technology in the past year was $129,000, but 70% said their company spent less than $100,000 on risk management software. ####  ##### No one RMIS provider dominates the market. ####  ##### One-third of the risk managers said they did not receive any training when new technology was adopted, but the survey was of senior executives with an average age of 53.2, who may not use the technology every day. ####  ##### The Jan. 12-27 survey has a 95% confidence level. #### "
"Preparing for the inevitable","Risk Management","Risk Management, Technology"," ##### Difficulty in forecasting rapidly changing risks, notably cyber liability and reputation risk, are driving risk managers to seek more from their risk management information systems. ####  ##### RMIS once focused on basic tasks such as claims and insurance policy management. Observers say today's risk managers want to increase their predictive analytic capabilities, but also worry about the accuracy of such forecasts. ####  ##### “There are basically two schools of thought within the risk management community,” said John Phelps, director of business risk solutions at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida in Jacksonville and a past president of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. ####  ##### One consists of traditional risk managers who are looking for claims management capabilities, policy management and archiving abilities, he said. The other school of thought involves risk managers who focus primarily on enterprise risk management and are not involved in risk financing, he said. ####  ##### “Predictive analytics is by far the hottest topic” in RMIS today, said Paul Marushka, president of Chicago-based Marsh ClearSight L.L.C., previously CS Stars L.L.C. until it was rebranded last year. “The research we've seen is that 66% of the risk managers say they do not have the analytics they need to manage their risk effectively, and 86% say their ability to forecast risks will become more difficult in the next three years.” ####  ##### Mr. Marushka said risks continue to evolve and are getting harder to identify, citing cyber risk as an example. ####  ##### “It takes over 80 weeks for shareholder value to recover after a reputational crisis,” Mr. Marushka said. “The ability of risk managers to model that out so they can give a perspective holistically across their organizations is a top priority.” ####  ##### “We see an acceleration, with risk managers talking about uninsurable risks,” said Bob Morrell, CEO of Kennesaw, Georgia-based Riskonnect Inc. ####  ##### “The nature of risk management is evolving dramatically, from a relatively steady state to more of a rapid-response environment,” said Stephen Rhee, Chicago-based CEO of Ventiv Technology Inc. He said that risk managers must be prepared to deal with developments that can arise at any moment. ####  ##### “Cyber risk is different than just about any other class of risk facing a business today, in that there is somebody actively trying to do harm to your organization every day,” he said. “For every organization, it's not a matter of if, but when, in terms of when it will face a cyber attack.” ####  ##### Mr. Rhee said an RMIS system is “critical to help risk managers prepare for and deal with this inevitability.” ####  ##### According to Mr. Rhee, the effective quantification of risk exposures, both tangible and intangible, is probably the most difficult component of cyber risk assessment. “Use of a RMIS system in the quantification helps standardize both definition and values of all classes of exposed assets,” he said. ####  ##### According to Ventiv, other risks that could require a rapid response include weather impact, product failure and brand reputation. ####  ##### “We've tailored offerings that are specific around cyber risks, but also handle the broadest impact of what those risks entail,” said Riskonnect's Mr. Morrell. ####  ##### “When you look at what RMIS has done, it's been a matter of let's help the risk management department make better decisions,” Mr. Morrell said. “That's important, but there's a lot more to risk management than that. The complexity of the uninsurable side of risk just keeps increasing. If you use a spreadsheet to manage it, it just falls apart.” ####  ##### Rather than subscribing to one benchmark model or one built-in predictive model, risk managers “are coming to the same conclusion that insurance underwriters have subscribed to for many years: overlaying multiple data points drives better results,” said Aaron Shapiro, New York-based executive vice president of Chicago-based Origami Risk L.L.C. ####  ##### He said that on its own, each of these analytics is somewhere between a compass and a GPS. ####  ##### RMIS “won't tell you to … settle your claim for exactly $20,000',” he said, but “they will give you something better than, 'Head northwest,'” Mr. Shapiro said. ####  ##### “Our clients are now looking to subscribe to multiple sources and overlay the analytics and their own private data” such as claims, policies, exposures and the like, he said. ####  ##### “They can expect to see RMIS offer more and more flexible tools to automatically combine these data sets. The result will be more informed decisions and the ability to drive the best results via rules-based automation,” Mr. Shapiro said. ####  ##### “What do I see the rising risk professionals doing? They're using apps for everything” on their smartphones, said Darius Delon, chair of the RIMS Canada Council and associate vice president of risk management at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta. ####  ##### “The integration of a worthwhile app that's on your phone that allows your common staff members that have the app to actually record the incident” would be a welcome addition to RMIS, he said. For a university, an incident could range from water damage to property to a campus commotion, he said. “We have some stuff that's cloud-based, but you have to log into the system … you're already away from the incident. It would have to be so simple that everybody could do it.” ####  ##### “If you don't capture the incident, you don't manage the claim” that arises from it, Mr. Delon said. #### "

"AIG faces up to past losses, future challenges as break-up pressure mounts","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, AIG, Financial Results"," ##### Poor commercial property/casualty insurance results helped push American International Group Inc. to a net loss of $1.84 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015 from a net gain of $655 million during the same period a year earlier, the New York-based insurer said Thursday. ####  ##### At the same time, AIG conceded to pressure from activist shareholder Carl Icahn and added board seats for his allies. ####  ##### “Commercial Insurance reported a pre-tax operating loss of $2.1 billion compared to pre-tax operating income of $1.2 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by the previously announced $3.0 billion charge for adverse prior year loss reserve development in property casualty and lower net investment income in property casualty and institutional markets,” said an AIG statement announcing its results. Catastrophe-related losses also jumped to $213 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million during the corresponding period in 2014. ####  ##### Commercial insurance's combined ratio in the fourth quarter deteriorated to 161.5% from 103.4% posted during the fourth quarter of 2014. Net written commercial insurance premiums declined 1.9% to $4.60 billion. ####  ##### For 2015 as a whole, net income dropped 70.8% to $2.20 billion. Net written commercial premiums dropped 2.8% to $20.44 million and the combined ratio deteriorated to 115.0% from 100.2%. ####  ##### The results came as AIG has faced pressure from investor Carl Icahn and others to split into three companies — life, property/casualty and mortgage insurance — to increase shareholder value and to get AIG off the list of systemically important financial institutions. AIG is one of three insurers — MetLife Inc. and Prudential Insurance Co. being the others — designated as SIFIs and thus subject to increased federal oversight. MetLife is currently challenging the designation in court, where proceedings began this week. ####  ##### AIG announced recently that it would put up to 19.9% of its mortgage insurance business on the market in an initial public offering later this year, with an eye to selling off the entire business. ####  ##### Along with its earnings announcement, AIG said Thursday that it was expanding its board of directors to 16 members from 14. The two new members it will nominate are John Paulson, president of Paulson & Co., and Samuel Merksamer, a managing director of Icahn Capital L.P. ####  ##### Mr. Icahn posted a statement on his website noting the agreement with AIG under which the two new board members would be nominated, adding that he declined to go on the board because of his “involvement with so many other companies at this time.” ####  ##### “We welcome John Paulson's addition to the board and believe his involvement will be additive, especially in that we both have stated the same goals for AIG,” Mr. Icahn wrote. “We commend the board for adopting a number of our recommendations over the last few months. We continue to believe that smaller and simpler is better and look forward to working collaboratively with the board and management to help catalyze a turnaround in core (property/casualty) operations, a more transparent operating structure, and the ultimate shedding of the SIFI designation. We believe that AIG stockholders will benefit from our agreement.” ####  ##### During an earnings call Friday, AIG President and CEO Peter Hancock said he was “pleased we have reached a solution” that avoids a “distracting” proxy fight at the AIG's annual meeting later this year. ####  ##### He said that AIG has already taken steps to become a more “streamlined” company. These included a reduction in the ranks of senior management by more than 20% announced late last year and the announced sale of part of its stake in Chinese insurer PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd. Last month, AIG also announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its broker-dealer AIG Advisor Group for an undisclosed sum. ####  ##### “We stand by our plan” to cut costs and to improve the company's performance, said Mr. Hancock Friday. ####  ##### “The company's operational plan is a move in the right direction — and looks to us much like they are re-focusing on 'shrinking to greatness' in property/casualty,” said Josh Stirling, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. L.L.C. in New York in a note. “Though we have been more a critic of management than most, after two years in the wilderness, management's recent plan addresses many of our concerns.” ####  ##### Mr. Stirling also viewed the addition of the new board members as a positive step. ####  ##### “Adding activists to the board will — at a minimum — ensure leadership's focus and commitment on shareholder value, and provide continued pressure to deliver,” he wrote. “But more importantly, letting the activists behind the curtain will allow them to engage with the full board — and a full set of nonpublic financials — to both challenge management's plan, as well as explore other strategic alternatives — like more aggressively selling assets, and pursuing an explicit plan to de-SIFI.” #### "

Hensarling said. ####  ##### He said the committee’s consideration of the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act — H.R. 2901 — is a priority for his panel. The measure would give states the right to regulate private flood insurers in an effort to encourage the development of a private flood insurance market and lessen dependence on the NFIP. ####  ##### “I’ll do everything I can do to open up the program,” Rep. Hensarling said, adding there are “huge segments” of the flood insurance market that could be opened up to the private market. ####  ##### Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his own remarks to summit attendees, called cyber threats “the white elephant in the room.” He said that the Obama administration has no policy to prevent cyber attacks such as the one on the Office of Personnel Management in June 2015, that compromised personal information on millions of people. “There will be more” attacks, he said. Sen. McCain said that the Russians are the best at carrying out cyber attacks against U.S. interests, with the Chinese ranking second. ####  ##### The summit drew about 150 attendees, which set a record. #### "

Underwriting profit for the other primary insurer group increased 31.6% to $824 million compared with a year earlier. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway said in its annual report that the results reflect rising claim costs at GEICO and lower earnings from reinsurers, which were partially offset by increased earnings from other primary insurance operations. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway's overall net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31.8% to $5.48 billion, bolstered by improved results in its railroad business. For the year as a whole, Berkshire Hathaway's net income increased 21.2% to $24.08 billion. ####  ##### Managing Director Meyer Shields and Assistant Vice President Christopher Campbell at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in Baltimore said in a report they anticipate that Gen Re and Berkshire Hathaway's premium volumes and margins “to generally decline in 2016 and beyond, reflecting enduring reinsurance price competition and some fallout from Berkshire's increasing pursuit of primary premium volume at the likely expense of some former cedents.” ####  ##### Results for the primary group, said the analysts, “reflected strong, but slowing growth within Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance,” which is attributable to “the persistently favorable claims environment. ####  ##### “Sustained impressive underwriting profitability despite (the business') presumed rapid growth is unusual and suggests to us that Berkshire is winning unusually profitable business,” Messrs. Shields and Campbell said in the analysis. ####  ##### The report said also Berkshire Hathaway Specialty, which has hit $1 billion in annual premiums, “has created something of a virtuous cycle for itself. We attribute a lot of its success to particularly profitable business won from (New York-based American International Group Inc.). ####  ##### “As much of (the unit's) senior management came from AIG, a lot of AIG's remaining commercial business is unprofitable, and its withdrawal from particularly unprofitable products should provide more opportunities for (the unit) to sift through (likely at higher, or much higher, rates.)” said the report. ####  ##### Cliff Gallant, an analyst at Nomura Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said in an investor note that reinsurance pricing “remains under pressure, particularly in the property catastrophe lines, and the company continues to withdraw capacity as reflected in declining premium volume. ####  ##### “In a period of low loss activity, however, underwriting results were strong, with Gen Re reporting an 87.6% combined ratio and (Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group) reported a 90.8%,” Mr. Gallant said. #### "
"Catastrophe bonds attract investors despite concerns over lack of information","Risk Management","Insurance-linked Securities"," ##### NEW YORK — Investors and advisers expressed optimism for continued growth and support of the insurance-linked securities market even as they discussed the need for greater transparency and disclosure. ####  ##### “We should all be optimistic about prospects for the coming year,” said Bill Dubinsky, head of insurance linked securities for Willis Capital Markets & Advisory in New York. ####  ##### One advantage insurance-linked securities offer institutional investors is that such securities are not correlated with the broader equity and debt markets and thus offer investment diversification. ####  ##### “For most investors, they are really attracted to the asset class for the diversification benefit,” said Todor Todorov, senior investment consultant — hedge fund research, for Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. in New York. ####  ##### “I think it surprised people in terms of its uncorrelated nature, again, especially the new investors,” said Jonathan Malawer, managing director and senior investment analyst for K2 Advisors L.L.C. in New York, adding that 2015 was “such a challenging period for financial markets.” ####  ##### “Investors continue to grow assets under management notwithstanding the softer market,” said Mr. Dubinsky on the sidelines of the 16th annual Insurance & Risk-Linked Securities Conference sponsored by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association last week in New York, where Mr. Dubinsky was co-chairman of this year’s conference. ####  ##### “Total nonlife ILS capital reached $70 billion at year-end 2015, and net new capital continues to flow into the space,” said Mr. Dubinsky. ####  ##### Mr. Malawer said he believes the ILS market has staying power. “I think investors are in it for the long-term for sure,” he said. ####  ##### “We came to this market with a long-term view,” said Dan Bergman, head of investment research and insurance-linked securities, Third Swedish National Pension Fund, Stockholm, Sweden. ####  ##### Diversification was part of the draw, he said. ####  ##### “We came to this market for diversification,” said Mr. Bergman, adding “but not only for that,” emphasizing that returns were equally as important and portfolios are adjusted as such. ####  ##### “We’ve now worked in this market space for 10 years, and we don’t plan on leaving, but we do move allocations up and down,” said Mr. Bergman. ####  ##### As the market grows and expands, it encounters new demands and challenges, high among them concerns over disclosures of losses to catastrophe bonds. ####  ##### “As the 144A market has expanded with many more catastrophe bonds with indemnity triggers, there’s been a greater need for real-time disclosure to investors with regard to losses,” said Michael Groll, a partner in the corporate insurance and regulatory group of Willkie Farr & Gallagher L.L.P. in New York, referring to one leading ILS format under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. ####  ##### His views were echoed by John DeCaro, founding principal and portfolio manager with Elementum Advisors L.L.C. in Chicago. ####  ##### “As an investor, we are desirous of as much information as possible,” said Mr. DeCaro. ####  ##### There was confidence, however, that this would happen. ####  ##### “Our view is that over time disclosures will increase,” said Ben Rubin, executive vice president, capital markets for Axis Re U.S. in New York. ####  ##### Although catastrophe bond issuance declined to $6.9 billion in 2015 from $8.0 billion in 2014, the sector is still showing promising signs of growth, according to insurance industry reports. ####  ##### Both Aon Benfield Securities and Swiss Re Ltd. say in reports issued Jan. 21 and Jan. 22, respectively, that 2016 catastrophe bond issuance could reach $7 billion. ####  ##### Meanwhile, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory, a Willis Towers Watson unit, notes in a report issued Jan. 19 that the 2014 total was bolstered by the largest single catastrophe bond ever issued, the $1.5 billion Everglades Re Ltd. from Citizens Property Insurance Corp., a bond providing coverage for Florida windstorms that was upsized more than once due to strong demand. ####  ##### “Looking at the headline catastrophe bond figure, a decline in issuance appears to be the case. However, this general picture fails to account for the huge $1.5 billion transaction completed in 2014 — Citizens’ Everglades Re — which skews any prior-year comparison,” said Mr. Dubinsky in a statement accompanying the Willis report. ####  ##### The Aon report, “Insurance-Linked Securities Year-End 2015 Update,” also noted that 2015 saw a record level of catastrophe bond maturities at $6.8 billion. ####  ##### The Swiss Re report, “Insurance Linked Securities Market Update, Volume XXIV, January 2016,” notes that this trend will continue with close to $4 billion worth of scheduled maturities in the first half of 2016. ####  ##### Growth in the ILS sector in 2015 could also be seen by an important expansion in geography and covered perils as the first catastrophe bond was launched in China. ####  ##### The third quarter saw four transactions including Panda Re Ltd., the first China-exposed catastrophe bond, which provides $50 million of earthquake coverage for China Property and Casualty Reinsurance Co. ####  ##### The fourth quarter saw six transactions including Kilimanjaro Re Ltd. which provided a total of $625 million of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico hurricane and earthquake coverage for Everest Reinsurance Co. #### "
"FAA starts rule-making process for public drone flights","Risk Management","Enterprise Risk Management, Regulation, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Technology, Aviation"," ##### (Reuters) — The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday said it would develop drone regulations allowing some unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to fly over people, an authorization eagerly sought by a range of industries including real estate and agriculture. ####  ##### The U.S. aviation regulatory agency, under pressure from Congress and industry to accommodate commercial drones, said it established a rule-making committee that would recommend a new regulatory framework by April 1. ####  ##### Authorization to fly over people would be vital to the kind of package delivery services envisioned by Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. But the new committee will focus on smaller UAVs that are used for aerial photography in real estate, agriculture and surveying. ####  ##### The drones to be examined would include micro UAVs that weigh no more than 4.4 pounds (2 kg). But larger ones could also be included if their design, shape or slow speed posed little or no risk to people on the ground or to manned aircraft, the FAA said. ####  ##### Commercial drone operations are illegal in the United States without specific FAA permission. The agency is expected to release final regulations by late June that would allow flights by commercial drones weighing up to 55 pounds (24.95 kg). ####  ##### An FAA spokeswoman said the new committee's work was part of a separate effort. ####  ##### ""We recognize the significant industry interest in expanding commercial access to the National Airspace System. The short deadline reinforces our commitment to a flexible regulatory approach,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. ####  ##### Lobbyists predicted the process would take years to produce an actual rule. ####  ##### The announcement came as lawmakers in Congress consider legislation that would greatly reduce restrictions on micro drones. A six-year FAA reauthorization bill, which could be weeks away from a vote in the House of Representatives, would exempt small drones from requirements including the need for an operator to acquire a pilot's license. ####  ##### The FAA said the committee will develop recommendations for performance-based standards for drones that can be operated safely over people and determine how drone makers can comply with the requirements. ####  ##### The agency will draft a rule-making proposal after reviewing the committee's report. #### "
"RSA Insurance ramps up cost-cutting, return targets as 2015 profit soars","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Zurich, United Kingdom, Financial Results"," ##### (Reuters) — British insurer RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. on Thursday ratcheted up its return targets and cost-cutting plans following an abandoned takeover bid last year from Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. as it reported a 43% rise in operating profit for 2015. ####  ##### Shares in the company, best known in Britain for its More Than brand, soared more than 7%, leading the FTSE 100 index higher. ####  ##### Stephen Hester, brought in from Royal Bank of Scotland P.L.C. to turn the company around two years ago, previously called the aborted £5.6 billion ($8.07 billion) takeover attempt by Zurich a distraction. ####  ##### Mr. Hester told a media call the group had received no other approaches after the Zurich bid fell away, and would have to rely on self-help for growth. ####  ##### ""It's a tough and competitive environment, interest rates won't give us any help,"" Mr. Hester said. ""We had a bit of a dance with Zurich in the summer. Relative to six months ago, (RSA) is stronger and better."" ####  ##### RSA said it was targeting the upper half of its medium-term performance goal of 12% to 15% underlying return on tangible equity by 2017, ""with further improvement to come thereafter."" ####  ##### It said it expected to make cost savings of £250 million ($360.1 million) by 2016, a year ahead of schedule, and was targeting more than £350 million ($504.2 million) in gross annualized savings by 2018. ####  ##### Operating profit of £523 million ($753.4 million) was well above analysts' consensus of £481 million ($692.9 million) in a company-supplied forecast. ####  ##### RSA had a combined ratio of 96.0%, against a forecast 97.1%, despite floods in Britain in December that cost it £76 million ($109.5 million) in losses. A ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit. ####  ##### The firm published a solvency capital ratio of 143% under new European Solvency II capital rules prior to the completion of the sale of its Latin American business, and set a target ratio of 130% to 160%. ####  ##### A solvency ratio of 100% means an insurer has set aside enough capital to meet underwriting, investment and operational risks. #### "

"EEOC proposes federal agency employment targets for the disabled ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, Disability"," ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking Tuesday that reaffirms the government's commitment to achieve a 12% representation employment rate for individuals with disabilities, and a 2% representation rate for individuals with “targeted/severe” disabilities for its employees. ####  ##### The proposed rule, which will be officially published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, does not affect private employers, the EEOC said. Members of the public have until April 25 to comment on the proposal. ####  ##### In addition to setting the numerical goals, and requiring enhanced efforts to hire individuals with disabilities, the proposed rule would require agencies to provide “personal assistance services” to employees who, because of their disability, require help with services such as eating and using the restroom while at work, the agency said. ####  ##### Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires federal agencies to create affirmative action plans for the employment of people with disabilities and to submit those plans to the EEOC, the agency said. ####  ##### “Although federal agencies have improved their efforts to hire and retain individuals with disabilities, they remain underrepresented in the federal workforce,” says the EEOC in a background information on the rulemaking. ####  ##### “The federal government has a special responsibility to lead by example in serving as a model employer for people with disabilities in the workforce,” said EEOC Chair Jenny Yang in the statement. “This proposal offers concrete steps and accountability mechanisms to promote employment and advancement opportunities for people with disabilities, including individuals with targeted or severe disabilities.” ####  ##### In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20130828/NEWS07/130829816 finalized a proposed rule under which federal contractors and subcontractors would be required to set a hiring goal of having 7% of their workforce in each job group be people with disabilities. #### "
"Restaurant to pay $450,000 in sexual harassment case","Risk Management","Employment Practices"," ##### A Lexington, Kentucky-based restaurant franchisee has agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in connection with alleged sexual harassment at its Memphis, Tennessee, restaurant. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement Friday that Mint Julep Restaurant Operations L.L.C., an independent restaurant company and franchisee of Irving, Texas-based casual dining chain Cheddars Casual Café, will pay $450,000 to 15 individuals to settle the EEOC lawsuit. ####  ##### The EEOC said Mint Julep, which operates 42 Cheddar Café restaurants, permitted sexual conversations and jokes and allowed a general manager and bar manager to subject several female employees to sexual harassment at the Memphis restaurant. ####  ##### The EEOC said also that the restaurant managers made requests for sexual favors and explicit sexual comments, subjected female employees to unwelcome touching, and did not respond to complaints “in a prompt and appropriate manner.” ####  ##### The EEOC charged the company with sexual harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition to the monetary relief, settlement terms include mandatory anti-harassment training and maintenance of workplace cameras, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “Having and disseminating an anti-harassment policy does not satisfy federal prohibitions against sexual harassment,” said regional attorney Faye Williams of EEOC's Memphis District Office, which serves Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Mississippi, in a statement. “Employers must also enforce it. When an employer allows its managers to abuse its female employees in these ways and allows a sexually hostile work environment to persist, it is obviously not enforcing its anti-harassment policy. An unenforced policy is tantamount to having no policy at all.” ####  ##### Court papers say the settlement does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing by Mint Julep. ####  ##### Its attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### Last year, the EEOC reached a $160,000 settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit against Red Lobster Restaurants L.L.C., in which a manager was charged with sexually harassing three female employees. #### "

She's a regular lecturer at conferences and other events around the world. She sits on the boards of two public companies and mentors young lawyers. ####  ##### She says she'll keep going as long as she enjoys the work. ####  ##### “I would say that I think my generation is realizing that life doesn't end at 65 like it did a generation ago,” she said. “You can continue to do what you love, as long as you are healthy, and to me, this is where I want to be. I can't see myself on a beach unless it's vacation.” ####  ##### Her experience spans decades and includes work as outside and insurance counsel, working closely with boards of directors, general counsel and in-house legal teams to help clients design and implement effective governance and compliance programs. She also advises boards and executives on crisis management. ####  ##### No longer in the insurance industry per se—she worked at AIG for three years — Ms. Kelly says her work is not unlike what she did in the legal department of one of the country's largest insurance companies. ####  ##### She joined DLA Piper in 2010 as a partner and then, in 2013, was named a co-managing partner of DLA Piper Americas, the first women to hold that position. Besides that, she co-chairs the Global Governance and Compliance practice and is a member of the firm's Global Board and Executive Committee. ####  ##### “I deal with people all the time, I work with clients all the time and I do a lot of work internally with my partners,” she said. “When I was at AIG, I ran a large legal department and I interacted a lot with members of the C-suite. When you are dealing with people in whatever capacity, there are a lot of similarities.” ####  ##### Ms. Kelly's departure from AIG made headlines; she didn't accept a pay cut under the AIG bailout orchestrated by President Barack Obama's administration at the height of the financial crisis. The move would have halved her salary; instead she left the embattled company with a severance reported by Reuters as $2.8 million. ####  ##### “I look fondly at my time at AIG because I was there at the height of the crisis,” she said. “There is nothing better than a good crisis for a lawyer.” ####  ##### Before AIG she was general counsel for several major companies and is credited with helping MCI/WorldCom MCI Inc. (formed by the merger of MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.) out of bankruptcy before the telecommunications giant was bought by Verizon Communications Inc. in 2006. In 1999 Ms. Kelly was recruited by Sears Roebuck and Co. as a senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary to help the large Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer manage compliance and credit woes. ####  ##### She uses her experience to not only help clients but also to mentor a number of women lawyers. She is also a member of DLA Piper's Leadership Alliance for Women, an initiative that works to hire, retain and advance female lawyers. ####  ##### As a mother, Ms. Kelly said she likes to encourage women. A story well-known among her colleagues, she was in labor with her twin boys when she took a conference call — dedication that kept her on the track to partner at the Washington D.C. law firm now known as Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr L.L.P. ####  ##### Today her 26-year-old sons work for hedge funds in New York. ####  ##### Among her best advice is to take risks but to listen to your instincts. ####  ##### “The one thing you have to be is true to your moral compass,” she said. “You have to listen to that little voice when something looks like it is not right, it probably isn't. You owe it to yourself to look into it. It's part instinct, part judgment.” ####  ##### Watch for the next profile in our ""Where are they now..."" series next month.

"FAA taps experts to write rules for flying drones over people","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Regulation, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, Aviation"," ##### A task force of manufacturers, aviation industry associations and others who have a vested interest in small unmanned aircraft systems are meeting to determine an acceptable risk level when drones fly above people. ####  ##### The Federal Aviation Administration said Feb. 24 that the aviation rulemaking committee, comprising 26 entities including AT&T Technologies, Intel Corp. and GoogleX, has until the end of the month to come up with recommendations for safely operating “certain” unmanned aircraft systems when flying over people or under a covered structure. ####  ##### Last year the FAA was thinking of creating a new class of “micro” drones, any UAS less than 4.4 pounds and made out of materials that “break, distort or yield on impact,” to minimize damage if it crashed and struck a person or object. The intention was to allow micro drones to fly over people. ####  ##### However, the FAA decided not to have weight as the defining factor. ####  ##### Instead, a safe operation category will base UAS rules on performance criteria such as speed. ####  ##### “Based on the comments about a 'micro' classification submitted as part of the small UAS proposed rule, the FAA will pursue a flexible, performance-based regulatory framework that addresses potential hazards instead of a classification defined primarily by weight and speed,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in the statement. ####  ##### Some of the considerations in making the performance-based choices are current and past research on human injury thresholds, hazard and risk assessment methodologies and “acceptable levels of risk” for bystanders not involved in operating the drone, the statement said. ####  ##### The committee has also been asked to figure out how manufacturers can prove a UAS meets the performance-based safety requirements and find ways for the FAA to verify that the UAS comply. ####  ##### On Dec. 21, the FAA began requiring the registration of all UAS weighing more than 0.55 pounds. Civil penalties for not registering a drone include a fine up to $27,500. Criminal penalties could mean fines of up to $250,000 and up to three years in prison. ####  ##### Nearly 300,000 owners registered their drones within the first 30 days after the FAA's online registration went live. That system is only for hobbyists, but the agency is working to open it to commercial operators by March 21. #### "
"VW faces Allianz suit over share drop; jobs under threat after scandal","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, Allianz, Germany, Auto liability, Gallery"," ##### (Reuters) — German insurer Allianz S.E. plans to sue Volkswagen A.G. over the sharp drop in its shares as a result of the carmaker's diesel emissions scandal, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. ####  ##### If successful, the lawsuit would add to financial pressures on Volkswagen that its chief executive said on Tuesday would be “substantial and painful.” ####  ##### At the same time, the company's labor leader warned that the extent of possible job cuts at VW would depend “decisively” on the level of U.S. fines for its cheating of emissions tests. ####  ##### “Should the future viability of Volkswagen be endangered by an unprecedented financial penalty, this will have dramatic social consequences,” works council chairman Bernd Osterloh told more than 20,000 workers at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. ####  ##### The “Dieselgate” scandal has forced out the previous CEO, tarnished one of Germany's most renowned corporate brands and driven down VW's share price by 31% since it emerged last September. ####  ##### According to Thomson Reuters data, Allianz Global Investors holds 0.06 percent of VW preference shares and just 10,000 ordinary shares, so will have lost some €8.6 million ($9.5 million) on its stake. ####  ##### The source said the Allianz lawsuit would happen “within this month.” Allianz said in a statement it had not yet filed an actoin against VW but was weighing a suit. ####  ##### The action will add to VW's litigation risks in Germany, where the carmaker already faces dozens of private lawsuits. ####  ##### But it is dwarfed by the potential costs in the United States, where the Justice Department has sued VW for up to $46 billion for breaching U.S. environmental laws. ####  ##### More than 500 lawsuits have been filed against the company in the United States, and there is still no fix for nearly 600,000 cars affected there. ####  ##### Risk to jobs ####  ##### Mr. Osterloh, who also sits on VW's 20-member supervisory board, called on the U.S. authorities to consider the risk of possible job cuts in deciding on penalties. “We very much hope that the U.S. authorities also have an eye for this social and employment-political dimension,” he said. ####  ##### Europe's largest automaker employs over 600,000 people at around 120 factories worldwide, including 270,000 in Germany. Its U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, employs about 2,200 people. ####  ##### Speaking at the Wolfsburg meeting, CEO Matthias Mueller said the scandal would inflict “substantial and painful” financial damage on the carmaker, without elaborating. ####  ##### Volkswagen last year set aside €6.7 billion ($7.39 billion) to cover the expected costs of recalling about 11 million diesel vehicles globally. It has postponed the release of its 2015 results by more than a month until April 28 to better assess the financial implications of the crisis. ####  ##### Outside the United States, France has opened a formal investigation into suspected “aggravated fraud” by VW, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Tuesday. ####  ##### “The software manipulations and its consequences will keep us busy for a long time,” Mr. Mueller said, adding that it would take years to determine the full extent of the financial impact. ####  ##### The state of Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, expects more “unpleasant news” to emerge over the months ahead but remains confident that the company has the financial strength to cope. ####  ##### “We will this year probably every now and then be confronted with unpleasant news related to 'Dieselgate',” Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, told the Wolfsburg meeting. ####  ##### “The damage will, on balance, not be minor, that much can already be said today, but Volkswagen luckily has a strong economic base,” Mr. Weil, also a member of the supervisory board, said. ####  ##### The Western German state, which holds 20% of VW's common shares, has “no reason” to alter its commitment to the carmaker despite the crisis, said Mr. Weil, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrat coalition partners. ####  ##### Separately, German prosecutors said on Tuesday they have widened their investigation into the emissions scandal and are now targeting 11 more employees. ####  ##### Klaus Ziehe from the state prosecutor's office in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, which is leading the German case against VW, said 17 people were now being investigated, up from six previously. ####  ##### “The number of suspects has risen, although none are from the management board,” Mr. Ziehe said. #### "

Mateski's lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests. ####  ##### Mateski alleged that Raytheon, his employer from 1997 to 2006, mismanaged its subcontract to develop the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor for the NPOESS, on which Northrop Grumman Corp held the main contract. ####  ##### Friedland said it would be unfair to the government and whistleblowers to impose a ""public disclosure bar"" against False Claims Act lawsuits such as Mateski's that identified ""specific instances of fraud,"" where public documents such as the GAO report merely described ""problems"" or even ""generalized fraud."" ####  ##### Monday's decision overturned U.S. District Judge Otis Wright's February 2013 dismissal of the lawsuit, and returned the case to his Los Angeles courtroom. ####  ##### False Claims Act cases let whistleblowers pursue claims on behalf of the government and share in recoveries. The United States in 2012 decided not to help Mateski pursue his case. ####  ##### The case is U.S. ex rel Mateski v. Raytheon Co, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-55341. #### "

"Ransomware attack on Apple's Macs reportedly limited","Risk Management","Risk Management, Technology"," ##### BOSTON (Reuters) — The first known ransomware targeted at Apple Inc.'s Mac computers was downloaded only about 6,500 times, according to a representative for the Transmission project, whose software was used to launch the attack. ####  ##### Transmission representative John Clay told Reuters via email that the ransomware was added to disk-image of its software after the project's server was compromised in a cyber attack. ####  ##### ""We're not commenting on the avenue of attack, other than to say that it was our main server that was compromised,"" he said. ""The normal disk image (was) replaced by the compromised one."" ####  ##### He added that ""security on the server has since been increased"" and that the group was in ""frequent contact"" with Apple as well as Palo Alto Networks Inc., which discovered the ransomware. ####  ##### The attack over the weekend was the first ransomware to breach Macs. ####  ##### Ransomware, one of the fastest-growing types of cyber threats, encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key to retrieve their data. ####  ##### Security experts estimate that ransoms total hundreds of millions of dollars a year from such cyber criminals, who typically target users of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system. ####  ##### Palo Alto Threat Intelligence Director Ryan Olson said the ""KeRanger"" malware, which appeared Friday, was the first functioning ransomware attacking Apple's Mac computers. ####  ##### ""This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom,"" Mr. Olson said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### Hackers infected Macs through the tainted program known as Transmission, which is used to transfer data through the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network, Palo Alto said on a blog posted on Sunday afternoon. ####  ##### When users downloaded version 2.90 of Transmission, which was released Friday, their Macs were infected with the ransomware, the blog said. ####  ##### An Apple representative said the company had taken steps over the weekend to prevent further infections by revoking a digital certificate that enabled the rogue software to install on Macs. The representative declined to provide other details. ####  ##### Transmission responded by removing the malicious version of its software from its website, www.transmissionbt.com. On Sunday it released a version that its website said automatically removes the ransomware from infected Macs. ####  ##### The website advised Transmission users to immediately install the new update, version 2.92, if they suspected they might be infected. ####  ##### Palo Alto said on its blog that KeRanger is programmed to stay quiet for three days after infecting a computer, then connect to the attacker's server and start encrypting files so they cannot be accessed. ####  ##### After encryption is completed, KeRanger demands a ransom of 1 bitcoin, or about $400, the blog said. ####  ##### Mr. Olson, the Palo Alto threat intelligence director, said that the victims whose machines were compromised but not cleaned up could start losing access to data on Monday, which is three days after the virus was loaded onto Transmission's site. #### "

"Zurich slashes pay for top management after poor 2015","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Zurich, Switzerland"," ##### (Reuters) — Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. cut 2015 pay for its top management by more than half after they failed to meet major performance targets, the Swiss insurer said in its annual report published Friday. ####  ##### Total 2015 pay for the 13 members of Zurich's top management team was $22.6 million, a big drop from the $55.4 million received by 12 executives in 2014. ####  ##### Zurich's shares fell 17% last year, the stock's worst performance since 2008, in response to a sluggish performance in its flagship general insurance business and back-to-back quarterly profit warnings. In contrast, the European insurance sector index rose 14%. ####  ##### Zurich said in its annual report that the key metric in connection with the managers' pay was net income attributable to shareholders, which fell 53% in 2015. ####  ##### Former Chief Executive Martin Senn, who left the company suddenly in December, was paid 2.5 million Swiss francs ($2.52 million) in 2015, less than a third of the 8.5 million francs ($8.57 million) he got in 2014. ####  ##### Mr. Senn had come under pressure following a failed takeover bid for Britain's RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. and a weak performance from Zurich's main business. ####  ##### Last month, Zurich appointed Generali CEO Mario Greco to replace Mr. Senn. Mr. Greco is set to take up his new job on Monday. #### "

Rather than perform a nail avulsion, in most of these instances Mantoura had merely provided her patients with routine foot care including clipping the patients’ toenails,” Connecticut U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly said in a statement. ####  ##### A nail avulsion is a surgical procedure to treat an ingrown toenail. Dr. Mantoura performed little more than pedicures. ####  ##### She was paid $206,000 from the false claims she submitted to Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance companies, Greenwich Time reports. ####  ##### Dr. Mantoura has been ordered to pay $618,000 in fines and restitution. She will not be allowed to submit federal health care claims, but she won’t serve any jail time.

"Former Chesapeake CEO charged with bid rigging ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Aubrey McClendon, former chief executive officer of Chesapeake Energy Corp and a legend in the U.S. energy industry, was charged on Tuesday with conspiring to rig bids to buy oil and natural gas leases in Oklahoma, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### The indictment follows a nearly four-year federal antitrust probe that began after a 2012 Reuters investigation found that Chesapeake had discussed with a rival how to suppress land lease prices in Michigan during a shale-drilling boom. Although the Michigan case was subsequently closed, investigators uncovered evidence of alleged bid-rigging in Oklahoma. ####  ##### In addition to the federal probe, the Michigan attorney general brought criminal charges against Chesapeake, which the company settled in 2015 by agreeing to pay $25 million into a compensation fund for land owners. ####  ##### The Justice Department indictment paves the way for what may be one of the highest-profile criminal antitrust cases against a well-known U.S. CEO in decades, and could thrust McClendon, a controversial figure whose aggressive leasing tactics are legendary in the energy industry, into the highest-stakes legal battle of a decades-long career. ####  ##### Oklahoma-based McClendon is a shale drilling evangelist who was once among the highest paid U.S. CEOs. He co-founded Chesapeake with fellow Oklahoma oilman Tom Ward in 1989. In 2013, McClendon stepped down from the helm of Chesapeake amid a liquidity crunch and corporate governance concerns. Ward left Chesapeake in 2006 and founded competitor SandRidge Energy Inc the same year. ####  ##### McClendon, who is now with American Energy Partners (AEP), was charged with one count of conspiracy to rig bids, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### ""The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,"" McClendon said in statement. ""I have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the Sherman Act became law to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold."" ####  ##### Chesapeake itself is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, the company said. ####  ##### ""Chesapeake has been actively cooperating for some time with a criminal antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice regarding past land leasing practices,"" said Chesapeake Energy spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. ""Chesapeake does not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines relating to this matter."" ####  ##### Chesapeake shares declined 3.6% in after-hours trading to $2.66. ####  ##### The seven-page indictment alleges that McClendon set up a conspiracy of two energy companies which agreed not to bid against each other in purchasing oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma from 2007 to 2012. The indictment did not name either company. ####  ##### The indictment comes at a time when energy executives across America are already facing considerable distress. Oil and gas companies like Chesapeake, SandRidge, and McClendon's new venture AEP, have struggled as the price of oil plummeted by 70% since late 2014. ####  ##### Both Chesapeake and SandRidge, once storied firms in Oklahoma's oil industry, have recently engaged restructuring experts as they scramble to pay off billions in debt and avoid potential bankruptcy. Chesapeake's stock price has tumbled more than 80% in the last year. SandRidge was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in January, and closed Tuesday at 4 cents per share. ####  ##### Much of the companies' debt was accrued in the period from 2007 through 2012 when McClendon was allegedly engaged in an antitrust conspiracy, a time when Chesapeake was snapping up millions of acres of land leases nationwide to expand its shale drilling. ####  ##### McClendon has also been embroiled in a lawsuit with Chesapeake which alleged that he took sensitive company data from his former company to build his new business. ####  ##### The Justice Department said that McClendon's indictment was the first case in an ongoing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anti-competitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry. ####  ##### ""His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions,"" said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer, head of Justice Department's Antitrust Division. ####  ##### Chesapeake, SandRidge, and McClendon had previously disclosed in securities filings that they were being investigated by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. #### "
"Work hours lawsuit could signal more health care litigation","Risk Management","Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability"," ##### More employers can expect litigation comparable to the lawsuit filed by a former restaurant worker, whose lawsuit, where she claimed her employer cut her hours to part-time to avoid Affordable Care Act costs, has successfully survived a motion to dismiss. ####  ##### To protect themselves against potential lawsuits, employers should carefully monitor any communications to workers on workforce reductions to avoid any suggestion they are being made to save money under the ACA, legal experts suggest. ####  ##### Last month, a U.S. District judge refused to dismiss a putative class action lawsuit filed in May 2015 by Maria De Lourdes Parra Marin in Maria De Lourdes Parra Marin v. Dave & Buster's Inc. et al. ####  ##### Ms. Marin had charged that, in response to the ACA's enactment, managers at a New York restaurant operated by Dallas-based Dave & Buster's told workers that to avoid costs totaling as much as $2 million it would reduce its full-time workers to 40 from more than 100, according to the Feb. 9 ruling by the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ####  ##### She said she was then reduced from full- to part-time status, causing a reduction in pay to a range of $150 to $375 per week from $450 to $600 per week, along with a loss of eligibility for medical and vision benefits, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Marin then filed suit, charging discrimination under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein denied Dave & Buster's motion to dismiss the case in his ruling. ####  ##### “Plaintiff has put forward factual allegations supporting her claim that the employer had the specific intent to interfere with her right to health insurance,” the ruling said. “The reduction in plaintiff's hours affected her employment, her pay, and the benefits she had and to which she would be entitled.” ####  ##### Experts say while they believe this may be the first such ruling in litigation filed over the issue of cutting back hours because of the ACA, more can be expected. ####  ##### They also point out the case itself is still in its very early stages. “This was just a motion to dismiss. The court didn't get into a determination of whether there was evidence” the employer had violated the ACA by intentionally manipulating hours and employees to avoid coverage, said Marc D. Katz, a partner with Andrews Kurth L.L.P. in Dallas. All the ruling said was that if, theoretically, the worker could prove what she claimed, there was a violation, he said. ####  ##### “There's definitely the potential for more” litigation on this issue, said David L. Barron, a member of law firm Cozen O'Connor in Houston. ####  ##### Even though the law has been around since 2010, it is only now “we're getting into the full swing” of its implementation, said Stephen J. Evans, an associate with Armstrong Teasdale L.L.P. in St. Louis. There has not been a lot of litigation in this area of ERISA, “and the ability to get attorney's fees and form a class action might make it an attractive area for a lawsuit,” he said. ####  ##### The New York ruling “certainly makes these types of lawsuits more attractive to plaintiffs' attorneys,” said Daniel T. Sulton, a shareholder with Ogletree, Deakins Smoak & Stewart P.C. in Greenville, South Carolina. ####  ##### “It's discouraging news to employers, who have always had legitimate reasons for business restructuring,” he said. ####  ##### Experts advise employers to be cautious about what they tell their workers. “The big picture is, before you make changes, or react to the ACA or any other law, that you would consult with your legal counsel and your consultant and make sure to manage any communications that are put out to employees,” so that you are not conveying the message that any changes are based on the cost of benefits, Mr. Evans said. ####  ##### If there is a cutback in hours, “It's probably not wise to have supervisors openly blaming it on (the ACA), or saying anything like that,” Mr. Barron said. ####  ##### However, “This should not prevent an employer from moving someone from a benefit-eligible position to a non-benefit eligible position, so long as the rationale behind it is not on a discriminatory basis, or there's an intent to interfere with someone's benefits,” Mr. Sulton said. ####  ##### Employers, though, should have “clear documentation” as to their legitimate business rationale for the job restructuring, Mr. Sulton said. #### "

The Ryanair plane's captain decided to make an unscheduled landing in Berlin's Schönefeld Airport 30 minutes after takeoff, to avoid the risk of the party members inflicting harm to other passengers, news reports said. ####  ##### German police escorted six of the drunken dozen from Southampton, England off the plane after the pilot made the Berlin stop, putting an end to the stag party — which by then had mostly downgraded to an in the aisle drunken fist fight between two of the groomsmen. The groom-to-be was one of the six escorted off by police, and the remainder of the party continued on to their destination without him. ####  ##### The group did not comply with cabin crew instructions and posed a security threat by reportedly refusing to stay in their seats while engaging in “horseplay.” One had allegedly stripped naked in front of the 170 passengers, German federal police said in a statement. ####  ##### The men, ages 25-28, that were removed from their party were charged with misdemeanors from air security law violations and facing fines up to $27,000, according to German police. The airline can also sue them. ####  ##### Banning drunk people from boarding planes, capping the number of drinks that can be served and keeping a blacklist of unruly passengers have all been taken into consideration by U.K. ministers, news reports said. ####  ##### Since their release, no reports have been made on the level of hangover experienced in the aftermath. #### "
"A few bad apples may be harming captives' reputation","Risk Management","Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability"," ##### The health of the captive insurance market has been good overall, but one captive manager is concerned that the behaviors of some members could damage the industry's reputation. ####  ##### In a Feb. 10 webinar presented by Strategic Risk Solutions that reviewed the past year for captives and gave projections for 2016, it was said that many captives are overcapitalized and doing quite well, according to Brady Young, president and CEO of captive manager Strategic Risk Solutions Inc. in Concord, Massachusetts. ####  ##### But he said some owners are in captives that should never have been formed in the first place, and these few could be seeing trouble ahead. ####  ##### “There has been too much aggressive selling. While these captives are solvent, the owners have been exposed to tax risks, and a lot of that is coming home to roost,” he said during the webinar for existing and prospective captive owners. ####  ##### The captive manager reported captive industry growth was strong at 4.8% for 2015, but much lower than the 8.6% for 2014, partly because of IRS scrutiny and the newly minted 831(b) election that changes the way small captives can be structured, he said. ####  ##### Mr. Young was also concerned about the large risks going into captives for cyber exposures. ####  ##### “Carriers are writing all this cyber liability insurance for really cheap premiums and chasing the market,” he said, “and at some point the losses are going to come.” ####  ##### He said he is concerned about the health of the industry when people do things that put the whole industry in a negative spotlight. ####  ##### “I am hoping there is going to be a shakeout, and the stupid things that are getting done are stopped, and the people who shouldn't be in the business, leave the business,” he said. “Then those who are trying to do things the right way can continue to have opportunities in the future.” ####  ##### As the soft market continues with no event, it places market pressure on captives as well, he said. ####  ##### “There just hasn't been big problems in most industries; things that happened 10 or 20 years ago seem like the Stone Ages,” he said, “and I think there will be some pressure on mature captives to stay around.” ####  ##### He said “it's been so long since we've had a hard market where anyone has felt any pain or volatility” that it is difficult to remember the purpose of a captive. ####  ##### “At some point the market may harden, and people are going to have to use their captive or come up with another solution because the risk is not getting smaller, it's getting bigger,” he said. ####  ##### Cell closures were reported in the webinar to be over 75% higher in 2015 than 2014, but the reasons for the closures varied. Some small captives were closed because of concerns from IRS investigations, some were parent company acquisitions, and some were chalked up to soft market conditions. ####  ##### Redomestication also caused some of the closures, but this led to new captives cropping up in the organization's home state with the prediction that as long as the home state has captive laws and “receptive regulators,” that trend will continue into 2016. #### "

The number of transactions was relatively unchanged at 183, however. ####  ##### Among property/casualty insurers the aggregate value of M&A deals increased to $39.6 billion in 2015 from $6.7 billion in 2014, driven by several large transactions, including Ace Ltd. and Chubb Corp.'s deal, according to the executive summary of the report, “Global Insurer Mergers & Acquisitions in 2015, The Big Bang.” ####  ##### “Key themes in the year included the desirability of specialty and Lloyd's targets, large acquisitions by Japanese and Chinese buyers, reinsurance consolidation, and combinations in sectors facing strong external challenges, such as crop insurance and medical professional liability,” said the study. ####  ##### The report predicts continued M&A activity. “The recurring themes of consolidation, product and geographic diversification suggest that more insurers will seek partners to keep up with large competitors,” the report says. ####  ##### In the health insurance and managed care sector, the $100.8 billion of aggregate transaction volume, which accounted for more than half of the year's $195 billion in global activity, compared with just $33 millionof disclosed deal value in 2014, said the report. The number of transactions also increased to 22 in 2015 from 13 in 2014. ####  ##### The transactions were stimulated by implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the report. “Growth in government-subsidized programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, accompanied by the retreat of traditional employer-based plans in favor of high-deductible plans and exchanges, generated pressure to acquire Medicaid and Medicare providers and build scale to generate efficiencies,” according to the report. ####  ##### In 2016, “with so many of the largest insurers having entered into transactions in 2015, it is likely that activity in 2016 will involve combinations among second-tier players,” the study says. #### "

"Fired Hilton hotel clerk's age and reverse discrimination case reinstated","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court ruling in a reverse discrimination case and reinstated a racial and age discrimination lawsuit filed by a hotel's terminated white front desk clerk who was in her 60s. ####  ##### Valeri Kay Kilgore began working as a front-desk agent for Hilton Garden Inc., a unit of McLean, Virginia-based Hilton Worldwide, in 2011, according to Thursday's ruling by the 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals in Atlanta in Valarie Kay Kilgore v. Trussville Development L.L.C. d.b.a. Hilton Garden Inc. ####  ##### In February 2012, the front desk manager, who was her supervisor, asked Ms. Kilgore to train two new part-time front desk agents who were young and African-American females with no front-desk experience, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore was told the new hires were to work at a sister property, but they remained at Ms. Kilgore's hotel Trussville, Alabama, and her hours were reduced because of the new hires. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore alleged that a number of discriminatory comments were made to her, including the hotel's general manager telling her, “You are old, Katie. Where's your sense of humor. Can't you remember what that is? You did hear me, right?” The front desk manager was black, while the general manager was white, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore was terminated by the hotel in June 2012, allegedly for rude and discourteous behavior towards guests. She filed suit in U.S. District Court in Birmingham Alabama in March 2013, charging race and age discrimination, and the court granted Hilton summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore appealed the ruling, and a three-judge appellate court unanimously reinstated the case. Ms. Kilgore “presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of both age and race discrimination, creating an inference of unlawful discrimination,” said the ruling, citing that the two African-American hires remained at the hotel after she was fired, and the comments that were allegedly made to Ms. Kilgore. The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings. ####  ##### In 2014, a federal appeals court upheld an $82,000 award to a white attorney who claimed he was the victim of discrimination by a black-majority hospital board that replaced him as the board attorney with a black attorney. #### "
"Loading up on cyber risk could be a negative for insurers' ratings","Risk Management","P/C Insurers"," ##### Uncertainties surrounding insurers' coverage of cyber risks now outweigh the benefits of their potential earnings growth from a ratings perspective, Fitch Ratings Inc. said in a report Monday. ####  ##### “At this stage, Fitch would view aggressive growth in stand-alone cyber coverage, or movement to high portfolio concentration in cyber, as a negative to the ratings,” according to the New York-based rating agency's report, “Global Cyber Insurance Market Update, Expanding Threats Amplify Underwriting Opportunity, Loss Potential.” ####  ##### “We believe the underwriting, pricing and reserving uncertainties currently outweigh the potential earnings growth benefits” of providing cyber insurance, according to Fitch. “Controlled growth as part of a diversified portfolio, coupled with continually enhanced underwriting standards, would generally be neutral to ratings.” ####  ##### The report said that while cyber coverage “represents a rare bright spot of positive premium rate movement” for the commercial insurance market, insurers “likely already have a considerable amount of cyber exposure embedded in existing commercial, property and liability policies. As such, an underwriter could have significant accumulations of cyber exposure before potentially adding to risk aggregations through writing stand-alone cyber policies. Practices for including cyber exclusions, sublimits and policy endorsements into existing policies are an evolving area of cyber risk management.” ####  ##### In addition, insurers “lack a meaningful volume of data on losses and exposures for cyber-related claims, which creates challenges in pricing risk and establishing pricing terms,” Fitch said in the report. ####  ##### Policyholders need advanced technical expertise and services for defense, and remediation processes following breaches, which leads to questions “whether any long-term role for insurers in cyber risk management will be usurped by more sophisticated firms or Internet providers,” although insurers are gaining more technical expertise, the rating agency said. #### "
"Lord & Taylor dressed down for Instagram promotion","Risk Management","Off Beat"," ##### A paisley print dress with an asymmetrical hemline that was described by one fashion website as having a “whimsical design perfect for summer” has gotten retailer Lord & Taylor L.L.C. into hot water with the Federal Trade Commission. ####  ##### The FTC charged last week that in March 2015, the New York-based retailer placed an article in a fashion magazine promoting the dress, which is part of its private label Design Lab collection, in an online fashion publication, Nylon, without disclosing that it was a paid promotion. ####  ##### Furthermore, Lord & Taylor also gave the dress, which originally sold for $88, free to 50 fashion “influencers,” and paid them between $1,000 and $4,000 each to post a photo of themselves wearing it on Instagram or another social media site. ####  ##### Lord & Taylor contractually obligated them to use the “@LordandTaylor” Instagram user designation and the hashtag “#DesignLab” in the caption of the photo they posted. ####  ##### The company also pre-approved each proposed post, but did not require the influencers to disclose they had compensated them to post the photo, and none of them did. The influencers’ posts reached 11.4 million individual Instagram users over just two days, according to the FTC. ####  ##### Under terms of the proposed settlement, which does not involve a fine, Lord & Taylor is prohibited from misrepresenting that paid ads are from an independent source, and is required to insure that its influencers clearly disclose when they have been compensated in exchange for their endorsement. ####  ##### Meanwhile, the dress quickly sold out, said the FTC. At this point, anyway, the 2015 dress is “so last year.” #### "

"Ruling may trigger more overtime suits","Risk Management","Employment Practices, General liability"," ##### The U .S. Supreme Court's ruling that statistical evidence can be used to determine overtime wages points up the need for employers to keep records of how long it takes employees to change their work clothes. ####  ##### Some say the high court's 6-2 ruling last month in Tyson Foods Inc. v. Peg Bouaphakeo et al., over whether workers should be paid for overtime spent donning and doffing their work clothes in a pork processing plant, is narrowly written, but others say its impact could extend well beyond wage-and-hour claims. ####  ##### Observers also say the high court did not address the critical issue of whether a class could be certified if it included workers who were not injured — in this case, those who did not work overtime while changing their work clothes — and therefore had no legal right to any damages. ####  ##### The 3,344 workers in the case were employees of the kill, cut and retrim departments of the Storm Lake, Iowa, pork processing plant operated by Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson. ####  ##### The workers filed suit in Sioux City, Iowa, federal court in 2007 alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law. ####  ##### The district court certified the litigation as a class action in 2008. ####  ##### During the trial, evidence included a study including 744 videotaped observations by an industrial relations expert, Kenneth Mericle, who concluded that it took about 18 minutes a day for the cut and retrim departments to change cloths and 21.25 minutes for the kill department. A jury in September 2011 awarded the workers $2.9 million in overtime benefits. ####  ##### An August 2014 ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis upheld the lower court, as did the Supreme Court. ####  ##### In its ruling for the workers, the Supreme Court majority said that because the employer failed to keep proper records, “the representative evidence here was a permissible means” of showing the hours that had been worked. ####  ##### The ruling, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, also cautioned, however, that the “fairness and utility of statistical methods in context other than those presented here will depend on facts and circumstances particular to those cases.” ####  ##### In a dissent, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who was joined by Associate Justice Samuel Alito, said the majority had redefined class action requirements and devised an “unsound special evidentiary rule for cases” under the FLSA. ####  ##### While it is good the court has given some direction to plaintiffs and employers on the admissibility of statistical evidence, “we are going to see an uptick in litigation here” because plaintiffs can use it to sustain class proceedings, said Christopher R. Kazanowski, a partner at Honigman, Miller, Schwartz & Cohn L.L.P. in Detroit. ####  ##### Fine-tuning legal language ####  ##### The case could also affect class actions beyond wage-and-hour claims “because the court used pretty broad language to say they will not permit a categorical rejection of all statistical evidence,” he said. ####  ##### “Until we have opinions from other federal courts fleshing out the ruling, we're going to see additional litigation by plaintiff class action attorneys trying to broaden that narrow window and exception” in the ruling, said Kenneth L. Racowski, counsel at Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney P.C. in Philadelphia. ####  ##### “It's going to be easier for plaintiffs' lawyers to do less discovery, do less work” and provide evidence through expert witnesses, rather than having to spend a lot of time fighting over getting evidence admitted in wage-and-hour cases, said defense attorney Rebecca L. Torrey, a partner at Manatt Phelps & Phillips L.L.P. in Los Angeles. ####  ##### Others, however, believe the ruling's impact will be more limited. ####  ##### The decision “basically ratified the way that many of these cases are litigated now,” said Eric R. Magnus, a principal in Jackson Lewis P.C.'s Atlanta office. ####  ##### “I suspect the court had trouble punishing the employees because the employer didn't keep the kind of records they were supposed to have kept,” said P. Russell Perdew, a partner at Locke Lord L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### The ruling does point to the need for firms to keep track of their workers' overtime, experts say. It imposes a record-keeping burden on employers that might not have been a factor before, Mr. Racowski said. #### "

The suit came as Willis sought to sell the division and other operations to Miller Insurance Services L.L.P. ####  ##### “A provision of approximately £22 million will be charged as part of second-quarter results as a consequence of the settlement, relating to the settlement itself and associated costs, and is incremental to any previously raised litigation provisions,” said JLT in a statement posted on its website. “This charge will be treated as an exceptional item and included in net litigation costs, as it is unrelated to the underlying business and trading performance of the group.” ####  ##### JLT added that the terms of the settlement are “final and confidential, and the matter is now closed.” JLT declined further comment through an outside spokeswoman. ####  ##### Willis did not reply immediately regarding the settlement. ####  ##### JLT is also currently being sued for alleged poaching by Aon P.L.C. In a suit filed in February in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, Aon accused current JLT Specialty Insurance Services Inc. CEO Michael Rice and six others of violating their agreements not to compete against Aon for two years after leaving the company. ####  ##### The suit also accused JLT Specialty Insurance Services Inc. and JLT Re (North America) Inc. of inducing the former Aon employees to violate their noncompete agreements and a “coordinated effort” with “certain other former Aon and current JLT employees” to engage in “multiple raids on Aon's officers, employees and clients” since August 2014. #### "

"Designation of MetLife as SIFI 'arbitrary and capricious': Federal judge","Risk Management","P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, MetLife"," ##### The Financial Stability Oversight Council ignored its own standards and made an “arbitrary and capricious” decision when it designated MetLife Inc. as a systemically important financial institution, according to a ruling by a federal judge. ####  ##### In an opinion issued late last month but not unsealed until Thursday, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer in the District of Columbia rescinded MetLife's designation as a SIFI, saying the FSOC's determination was “fatally flawed.” ####  ##### Two other insurers — American International Group Inc. and Prudential Insurance Co. — also have been designated as SIFIs subject to heightened reporting and stress test requirements, but MetLife was the only one to challenge the designation in court. ####  ##### SIFIs also are subject to “enhanced supervision” and “prudential standards,” but the Federal Reserve has yet to announce what that supervision and standards will be. ####  ##### “The Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined that 'material financial distress' at MetLife Inc. could 'pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States,'” Judge Collyer wrote, adding that the phrases stem from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which created FSOC, and were defined by FSOC in formal guidance issued years before MetLife's designation. ####  ##### “During the designation process, two of FSOC's definitions were ignored or, at least, abandoned,” Judge Collyer wrote. “Although an agency can change its statutory interpretation when it explains why, FSOC insists that it changed nothing. But clearly it did so. FSOC reversed itself on whether MetLife's vulnerability to financial distress would be considered and on what it means to threaten the financial stability of the United States.” ####  ##### She said FSOC also focused exclusively on the presumed benefits of its designation and ignored the potential costs. ####  ##### “While MetLife advances many other arguments against its designation, FSOC's unacknowledged departure from its guidance and express refusal to consider cost(s) require the court to rescind the final determination” that MetLife be designated a SIFI. ####  ##### Judge Collyer said she did not rule on MetLife's other arguments. ####  ##### “Having found fundamental violations of established administrative law, the court does not reach those arguments. For the reasons explained above, this court finds that the final determination was arbitrary and capricious,” Judge Collyer wrote. ####  ##### “I strongly disagree with the court's ruling,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who chairs the FSOC, in a statement issued Thursday. “This decision leaves one of the largest and most highly interconnected financial companies in the world subject to even less oversight than before the financial crisis.” ####  ##### “FSOC's authority to designate nonbank financial companies is a critical tool to address potential threats to financial stability, and it has made our financial system safer and more resilient,” said Mr. Lew. “We intend to continue defending vigorously the process and the integrity of FSOC's work, and I am confident that we will prevail.” #### "

"Judge cuts $18 million verdict for N.Y. financier's ex-employee","Risk Management","Risk Management, D&O, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — A federal judge on Thursday reduced by more than two-thirds the maximum sum a Swedish woman can recover after having prevailed in a jury trial against a New York financier she accused of sexual harassment and defamation. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said he would grant New York Global Group CEO Benjamin Wey a new damages trial unless his former employee, Hanna Bouveng, agreed by April 10 to have her damages award cut to $5.65 million from $18 million. ####  ##### In a 111-page decision, Judge Gardephe also upheld the jury’s finding of liability in the lawsuit, which accused Mr. Wey of coercing Ms. Bouveng into having sex, refusing his further advances and defaming her in a series of blog posts. ####  ##### “Based on the evidence at trial, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Wey’s sexual advances toward plaintiff were unwelcome, and that he knew they were unwelcome,” Judge Gardephe wrote. ####  ##### Mr. Wey’s lawyer had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Ms. Bouveng did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### In a Twitter post after the ruling, Mr. Wey declared “victory,” reiterating his claims that the lawsuit amounted to “extortion.” ####  ##### Mr. Wey was separately indicted in September on federal securities fraud charges for engineering Chinese “reverse mergers” and then manipulating stock prices to earn tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits. He has pleaded not guilty. ####  ##### The Bouveng trial garnered lurid tabloid headlines by pitting the young woman against a Wall Street financier about 20 years her senior. ####  ##### At trial, lawyers for Ms. Bouveng contended that Mr. Wey had engaged in a relentless campaign of harassment after hiring her in 2013 when she was 24, buying her gifts and demanding sexual favors in return. ####  ##### Ms. Bouveng’s lawyers said Mr. Wey’s actions led to sexual encounters before she rejected his further attempts, and that Mr. Wey fired her after discovering another man in her apartment, which he was helping to finance, in April 2014. ####  ##### After she filed her civil lawsuit, Mr. Wey wrote several disparaging articles in an online publication, TheBlot, controlled by FNL Media, a New York Global Group subsidiary. Both companies were also defendants. ####  ##### Mr. Wey’s lawyer, Glenn Colton, contended at trial that his client and Ms. Bouveng never had sex, and that Ms. Bouveng attempted to extort Mr. Wey after she was fired for substandard work. #### "

"Risk managers recall first time buying cyber cover","Risk Management","Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Technology"," ##### The road to obtaining cyber insurance for the first time can be a long and arduous one, risk managers say. ####  ##### “It was a daunting, overwhelming process,” said Donna Stone, Houston-based director of insurance risk management at GDF Suez Energy North America Inc. ####  ##### “It took us a long time to get out of denial” and realize the need for a policy, she said. ####  ##### The Paris-based energy firm initially was concerned about operational risk, but then came the realization that it also had personal employee data such as driving and health records. ####  ##### In all, she said during the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s annual conference in San Diego, it was a two-year process to determine the need for cyber cover. ####  ##### She said the attitude of the company's board of directors was, “We don't know what we're buying, but we're too afraid not to buy, so let's do that.” ####  ##### The policy was renewed this year, which required the participation human resources, regulatory compliance and communications arms of GDF Suez Energy, she said. ####  ##### “We're still learning as we go,” Ms. Stone said. ####  ##### “It's a long process the first time” said Timothy J. Flaherty, manager of insurance risk management at Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Inc. One challenge, he said, is that insurers' offerings are different and “it's very time consuming” to compare them. ####  ##### Risk managers must conduct a gap analysis and work with their brokers he said. When it comes to the first time of getting cyber coverage, “underwriters want to understand how you're protecting yourself,” which cannot be accomplished by sending an email or flash drive, he said. ####  ##### This information is “kind of the crown jewels,” he said. In Alcoa's case, the company's chief security officer personally handed over the required information to its broker. ####  ##### “Make sure you know exactly who's getting the information and track that. Keep the spreadsheet on who has it,” Mr. Flaherty recommended. ####  ##### Obviously, senior management needs to be involved, which he said is “critical, especially when it comes to limits and retentions” decisions. #### "

"Q&A: Barry Dillard of Walt Disney World Resort","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### Barry Dillard serves on the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s board and is the director of claims management for the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. There, Mr. Dillard, who is a member of RIMS' Central Florida chapter, leads a team of cast members who manage all aspects of the company's claims management program, including compliance operations, workers compensation and general disability claims. Mr. Dillard also teaches business management courses as an associate professor at the University of Phoenix. He received a bachelor of science in marketing from Hampton University and a master of business administration from Webster University. Mr. Dillard recently spoke with Business Insurance Senior Editor Mark A. Hofmann about his professional life and his service with RIMS. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: How did you get into claims management? ####  ##### A: It wasn't my intention. I was graduating with a degree in marketing and fully intended to go into marketing, but an Aetna property/casualty representative came to my university. I introduced myself and, before I knew it, I ended up a claim representative for Aetna Casualty & Surety in Dallas. ####  ##### Q: What are the most challenging and rewarding aspects of your job at Disney? ####  ##### A: When I think of the most challenging things, they are the things that keep me working here as well. It's the scale and scope of our business. We have theme parks, water parks, resort hotels, and we have more buses than the local transit authority. And all of this is on a property about the size of the city of San Francisco. ####  ##### When I think about the rewarding part, it's that our teams do a great job taking care of our cast members and guests when they file a claim. It's rewarding having the privilege of leading these teams as they make a difference in people's lives. ####  ##### Q: What have you learned from your students during your stints as an educator? ####  ##### A: I teach mostly undergrad business management students who are adult learners. They bring their experiences to the classroom and give me different perspectives. And I do learn a lot from them — you can't teach and not learn. ####  ##### Q: What can the claims management and risk management professions do to draw more young people into the field? ####  ##### A: It's really just exposure. It's talking with universities to get more degree programs and courses added to curriculums and creating more internship opportunities. It's also exposing students earlier. At the high school level, students know what lawyers do and they know what other professions do, but they really don't know that much about what insurance professionals do. ####  ##### Q: As a RIMS board member, what do you see as the major issues facing the organization? ####  ##### A: One that strikes a chord with me is for us to continue to innovate. Organizations that stay static don't stay around. Our members' roles are constantly evolving, and our organization needs to lead the way for our members and the industry. ####  ##### Q: What are you looking forward to at this year's conference in San Diego? ####  ##### A: The conference has a lot to offer, particularly its educational opportunities. It's the one time of the year our partners, insurers, brokers and vendors are all in one place. #### "
"Using social media to keep eye on fraud","Risk Management","P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Workers Comp Coverage"," ##### Looking through social media is an emerging and vital surveillance strategy for insurance companies wishing to investigate potential fraud, said a speaker at a session on advanced strategies in surveillance at the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s conference Tuesday in San Diego. ####  ##### “It's fundamental we investigate social media,” said Steve Cassell, Lake Mary, Florida-based president and CEO of Command Investigations L.L.C. “It can't be overlooked or ignored.” ####  ##### With 80% of people age 18 to 49 using such Internet sites as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to keep in touch with friends and family, the chances of a claimant using social media is high enough to warrant a thorough look when trying to ascertain whether the claim is legitimate, according to Mr. Cassell. ####  ##### “Just think about how many of your claimants fit” in the ages and demographics, said Mr. Cassell, who provided statistics from the Washington-based Pew Research Center of who's on social media. ####  ##### “There's so much available at our fingertips,” added Andy Olwert, Sarasota, Florida-based president of SUNZ Insurance Co., who presented alongside Mr. Cassell. ####  ##### Mr. Olwert said he wants to see more insurers and other organizations investigate claims using information that is publicly available, because the savings can be profound. ####  ##### Take the case of the football player presented at Tuesday's session. In side-by-side videos, Mr. Cassell showed a legal video deposition of a man placed on no-work status after being diagnosed with “neck sprain, right shoulder pain and back sprain,” according to Mr. Cassell's slides. The man, questioned by an attorney not pictured in the video was asked to rate his pain on a scale of 1 to 10. “It gets up to a 10,” the man said, in a low and confident tone, pointing to his shoulder and neck. ####  ##### Beside the window featuring the man's deposition was silent video, recorded by an investigator, of the man playing football just days after his alleged injury. The side-by-side presentation of what the man said and what he did on his free time and posted on social media ignited chuckles from the audience. ####  ##### Mr. Cassell, whose company worked on the case, said the insurance adjuster spotted some red flags in his initial deposition and called for a social media investigation, which revealed that had been playing with an adult football league. The investigator found the team's practice and game schedule and subsequently recorded the man tackling, running, catching and more. According to Mr. Cassell the insurer facing the man's claim spent $235 on a social media investigation and $4,000 on real-time surveillance. The company saved an estimated $87,000 and averted a potential permanent total disability claim, he said. The man is now facing criminal charges. ####  ##### Mr. Cassell urged attendees to enlist the help of a vendor with the experience to use a social media approach. ####  ##### Mr. Olwert said the challenge lies in the nature of the insurance industry itself, and that the solution is to involve every department in the end result — the savings. #### "
"Holding company sets out to focus on smaller, independent MGAs","Risk Management",""," ##### A group of investors has launched a managing general agent-focused holding company Doxa Insurance Holdings L.L.C. ####  ##### Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Doxa is a company built to partner with and acquire small to medium, independently owned and operated managing general agents that focus on specialty commercial property and casualty niches, Doxa said in a Tuesday statement. ####  ##### Lead investor Matthew Sackett is the former senior vice president of national sales for Fort Wayne-based K&K Insurance Group Inc. and former president and CEO of Fort Wayne-based Leisure Sports Specialists L.L.C., according to the statement. ####  ##### “Medium and small MGAs are often overlooked by firms that are actively acquiring within the insurance industry. The 'bigger is better' mindset prevails,” Mr. Sackett, CEO of Doxa Insurance Holdings said in the statement. “From our experience, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge, passion, and creativity within what the industry refers to as a small MGA.” #### "

Prior to joining AIG in 2012, he held a variety of roles at what now is Marsh L.L.C., most recently as U.S. property placement leader, Endurance said in a statement. ####  ##### Global Risk Solutions, launched earlier this year, targets large-account risk management clients. ####  ##### The new platform, headed by Global Risk Solutions CEO Michael Chang, has put its initial focus on the real estate and hospitality, financial institutions and professional services industries. ####  ##### Mr. Nardiello's “deep property product knowledge and extensive experience in our target industry classes, both as an underwriter and a broker, will differentiate us in these key markets,” Mr. Chang said in the statement. #### "
"Latest Gallagher purchase adds retail broker with construction expertise ","Risk Management","Agents & Brokers, Risk Management, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Mergers & Acquisitions, Construction"," ##### Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. said it has acquired a Waite Park, Minnesota, retail insurance broker known for its construction expertise. ####  ##### Itasca, Illinois-based Gallagher said Monday that it has purchased Charles Allen Agency Inc. for an undisclosed sum. ####  ##### Founded in 2010, Charles Allen provides commercial surety bonding and insurance services — including property, general liability and workers compensation coverage — in the Midwest and specializes in construction industry coverage. ####  ##### Charles Allen CEO Mark Gresser and his associates will continue to operate from their current location under the direction of Michael Pesch, head of Gallagher's Midwest region retail property/casualty operation, Gallagher said in a statement. ####  ##### “Their construction expertise and Minnesota presence will be a wonderful complement to our Midwest region,” J. Patrick Gallagher Jr., Gallagher's president and CEO, said in the statement. ####  ##### “We are excited about becoming part of the Gallagher organization,” Mr. Gresser said in an interview, while declining to go into detail. ####  ##### No decision has been made about the Charles Allen brand, a Gallagher spokeswoman said in an email. ####  ##### The purchase is the latest for the acquisitive Gallagher. Last week, the brokerage said it acquired Oklahoma City-based Capitol Benefits Group, an employee benefits insurance broker that provides employee benefits insurance products and consulting services to small and middle-market businesses and individual clients in the U.S. ####  ##### Gallagher is the world's fourth-largest broker, according to the latest Business Insurance ranking. #### "
"Arbitration clause ruling against employer could breed new level of caution ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### A federal judge's ruling that invalidated an employee arbitration agreement because it was ambiguous is likely to spur employers to design such agreements more carefully, an expert says. ####  ##### U.S.-based mortgage loan officers of Madrid-based Banco Santander S.A. filed suit against the bank and its affiliates last June alleging the bank failed to pay them and more than 1,000 other workers minimum wages and overtime under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act and New Jersey's wage-and-hour law ####  ##### The loan officers alleged that on weekdays they worked on mortgage files from home before their workday started; that their lunch breaks were frequently interrupted to handle customer services issues; and spent additional time working after the bank closed during the week and on weekends. They allege they were never compensated for the extra hours worked. ####  ##### In Donna Ranieri et al. v. Banco Santander S.A. et al., the bank filed a motion to compel individualized arbitration and to dismiss the lawsuit based on agreements the mortgage loan officers had signed. ####  ##### The bank argued that the employees were obligated to arbitrate the issues under an employment letter and mortgage development officer agreement the employees were required to sign. ####  ##### The signatures, though, were directly under a boldfaced sentence that said, “I certify, by my signature below, that I have received a copy of the mortgage sales commission plan, which has been provided to me.” ####  ##### But the employees' signature alone did not necessarily bind them to the agreements, U.S. District Court Judge Madeline Cox Arleo ruled last week in a Newark, New Jersey, hearing. ####  ##### “Typically, a party's signature on an agreement objectively manifests assent to agree to the entire contract,” the judge ruled. “But the (mortgage development officer) agreement's ambiguous language makes this case atypical because the purpose of the signature can be construed in more than one way.” ####  ##### Pointing out the signature was just above the line referring to the commission plan, the judge said: “On one hand, plaintiffs' signatures could memorialize only that they received the plan; on the other hand, the signatures could represent their assent to agree to the terms of the (mortgage development officer) agreement, as well as confirmation that they received the plan. ####  ##### “Defendants do not cite to, nor is the court aware of, any cases where a signature served to bind a party under such ambiguous circumstances,” the judge ruled in rejecting the bank's bid to have the claims arbitrated individually and returning the case for additional action. ####  ##### Reacting to the ruling, Harris S. Freier, a partner at law firm Genova Burns L.L.C. in Newark, it is significant “because federal courts have recently been very pro-arbitration and have been mandated to be so by the Supreme Court.” ####  ##### Mr. Freier said the rulings include the Supreme Court's December 2015 decision in DirecTV Inc. v. Amy Imburgia et al., in which the high court held that a California state court's refusal to enforce an arbitration clause in a contract between El Segundo, California-based DirecTV and its customers conflicted with the Federal Arbitration Act. ####  ##### “It is very rare” for a federal court to rule an arbitration clause in an employment agreement is invalid, although there has been some “pushback” in state courts, Mr. Freier said. On the other hand, the National Labor Relations Board has issued rulings that contend these agreements are an unfair labor practice because they prevent employees from engaging in concerted activity. ####  ##### “One of the ways employers have tried to get around the NLRB's rulings is to be very careful with the language” of their arbitration  clauses. This ruling will encourage them to be even more careful, “with a particular focus on what's right above the signature line,” he said. #### "
"Q&A: Cindy Steele, RIMS San Diego Chapter","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### Cindy Steele is the president of the San Diego Chapter of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. and director of risk management for San Diego-based ConAm Management Corp., which provides property management services in the United States. Ms. Steele spoke recently with Business Insurance Staff Reporter Donna Mahoney about the risks and opportunities specific to the Southern California area. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: What are some of the risks that are unique to companies in the San Diego area? ####  ##### A: We have a lot of tourism traffic; visitors are drawn here for SeaWorld or Legoland. There are also many people coming here for conferences. This makes risk managers concerned about the issues that tourism brings to a community such as the threat of pandemics. San Diego has the busiest single-runway airport (over 20 million passengers last year) and the fourth-largest port in California; both cruise ships and air traffic play a large role in creating the transient traffic, which heightens the exposure of a pandemic on the community and impacting the business profile. The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services ranks the threat of pandemics as one of the top risks for San Diego. ####  ##### Q: What role is the San Diego RIMS chapter playing in this year's RIMS conference? ####  ##### A: This year, our chapter vetted some of the RIMS speakers from our region. There were a lot of speakers who came through our chapter who were interested in speaking. We are also the recipient of a chapter achievement award at the conference in acknowledgment of the planning that we do for our chapter throughout the year. We are also hosting a small reception at the conference to welcome the workers that helped put the conference together. We don't have a large role, but we will make sure that the conference team has all the resources it will need. We also helped organized an after-the-conference airport tour for attendees of the conference, who will get a tour behind the scenes of the San Diego airport. We are expecting about 50 people at that tour. ####  ##### Q: Is there anything that the San Diego RIMS chapter does that you think is unique? ####  ##### A: The military is very prominent here, and we love that fact. We just got a brand new combat ship, the USS Coronado, that will be making San Diego its new home. The chapter supports the United Services Organizations. We have the largest USO in the country; it is a dedicated facility that makes the traveling needs of the armed forces a little easier and gives them a place to go.Our RIMS chapter supports the Waves of Appreciation organization that every year gives the chapter members the opportunity to say thank you to the men and women of the military on their way home or to a deployment.Chapter members have the opportunity to volunteer twice a year to this effort, first to assemble thousands of bags full of snacks for traveling servicemen and -women who often can't afford to pay the costly prices of airport food, secondly to distribute the bags that were packed previously. Last year, we helped to distribute about 3,000 backpacks full of snacks to soldiers at Christmas time. There are other businesses that do this with us as well — it's not just us — it's many businesses and organizations from the community that join in. #### "
"Goodell Award winner not content to rest on his laurels","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### Though he received what's considered a lifetime achievement award, Christopher E. Mandel, a former Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. president, told an audience of several hundred who stood to applaud his success that he's “far from done” in the industry. ####  ##### “We're going to keep going,” he said Monday after receiving the Harry and Dorothy Goodell Award at RIMS' annual awards luncheon at its conference in San Diego. ####  ##### The award, named for RIMS' first president, honors individuals who have furthered the goal of the society and the risk management discipline and is considered the organization's top honor. ####  ##### Mr. Mandel, Nashville, Tennessee-based senior vice president of strategic solutions for Sedgwick Claims Management Inc. and Business Insurance's 2004 Risk Manager of the Year®, told the group he was humbled by the award and went on to thank those who he said helped him. ####  ##### He also bestowed words of wisdom to the group: “Be willing to take risks. You can't achieve without that. (And) always do the right thing.” ####  ##### He was one of nearly a dozen professionals honored at the awards luncheon. ####  ##### RIMS President Julie Pemberton helped present the awards. ####  ##### “Their contributions have advanced our society and industry,” she told attendees. “They are examples of what can be accomplished when you go beyond.” ####  ##### The Ron Judd Heart of RIMS Award, which honors individuals who keep their chapters vibrant and relevant, was given to Robin Joines, senior vice president of risk management for Sedgwick and an active member of RIMS' Memphis Chapter. ####  ##### The Cristy Award, which acknowledges the person who receives the highest marks on the three exams required for the Associate of Risk Management designation, was presented to David Engel, director of risk management for AT&T Inc. ####  ##### New this year, the RIMS Ambassadors Group award recognizes individuals for their continued service with RIMS, going above and beyond to help strengthen and support the society's strategic initiatives. Its first inductees are Darius Delon, South Alberta Chapter member and associate vice president of risk services at Mount Royal University, and Daniel McGarvey, Western Carolina Chapter member and managing director at Marsh L.L.C. ####  ##### The RIMS Rising Star Award, which honors risk management professionals younger than 35 or who have seven or fewer years of professional experience in the industry, was given to Alumine Bellone, director of risk and insurance for Broward Health, and Kathleen Crowe, account specialist for Aon Risk Solutions, both honored for exceptional initiative, volunteerism, professional development, achievement and leadership potential. #### "
"Transgender issues test organizations' adaptability","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management"," ##### The “bathroom issue” is becoming a major one with respect to transgender employees, said a speaker at a session on developing a strategy for transgender employees at the Risk & Insurance Management Society's Inc.'s annual conference Monday in San Diego. ####  ##### In North Carolina, “when I go through the airport, I'm supposed to use the men's room. That ain't going to happen, and it's a problem,” said Victoria E. Nolan, risk and benefits manager at Hillsboro, Oregon-based Clean Water Services, who underwent the transition to a transgender female in 2011. She was referring to recent legislation approved in North Carolina that bars transgenders from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their birth gender. ####  ##### During the session, Ms. Nolan and Liani J. Reeves, an attorney at Bullard Law in Portland, Oregon, discussed how this and other issues applied to the workplace. Among the suggestions offered was the use of gender-neutral restrooms. ####  ##### Ms. Reeves discussed how the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Justice and Occupational Safety and Health Administration have all issued policies banning discrimination against transgender individuals.Signs of possible discrimination, she said, include refusing to use a preferred name or revise records to accommodate the new name, and requiring use of single-sex restroom facilities. ####  ##### “The key here is are you treating a transgender employee differently?” she said. ####  ##### Employers should review their policies to be sure there is nothing ambiguous or confusing, said Ms. Reeves. ####  ##### Employers should be prepared for this issue, said Ms. Nolan. “The time to have the conversation is before your first transgender employee arrives,” she said. ####  ##### Ms. Nolan said some of the issues employers should address include changing the person's name, coverage under health plans, communications within the organization, security clearances in dealing with matters such as budgets, restroom and dressing room use, appearance rules, dress code rules, expectations of employee conduct, manager and employee training and notifying and communicating with clients and customers. ####  ##### Ms. Nolan said having the first transgender in the workplace can make some employees very uncomfortable.“What I did was say I'd use restrooms further away” that were hardly ever used, while fellow workers became used to the situation, she said. “It only took a couple of weeks.” ####  ##### Ms. Reeves said obtaining senior management support is crucial. The CEO, she said, “sets the tone of the organization. If your senior management can send a strong message of support … that is going to be key.” Direct supervisors, however, also “need to be on board.” #### "
"Risk management hinges on perspectives and observations","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### Having the right perspective, collaborating with the right partners and being able to pick up on telltale signs of deception are critical tools for risk managers. ####  ##### The opening general session at the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s conference in San Diego Monday featured three keynote speakers delivering TED-style motivational speeches on these topics. It was a departure from the traditional single speaker format at a conference that usually marks the beginning of the formal program. The conference had kicked off with an opening reception on Sunday in the Gaslamp district, which was marked by a fireworks mishap. ####  ##### Vinh Giang, magician and motivational speaker, demonstrated how to perform a successful magic trick by changing the perspective of the audience and discussed collaborating with his partners to launch the Encyclopedia of Magic, an online program that instructs 65,000 students all over the world. ####  ##### “Magic is just a problem you can't solve,” he said. “Perspective is power, and collaboration is power. There is not one problem you cannot solve if you find the right perspective. Seek each other's perspective.” ####  ##### Scott Klososky, entrepreneur, author and consultant, introduced RIMS attendees to the world of 3-D printing, instructing them on the unique language involved such as the formal term “additive manufacturing,” which refers to the use of 3-D printing to manufacture objects from a digital file. He predicted that consumer-level 3-D printing of products such as toothbrushes will be coming soon thanks to technological advancements. ####  ##### “Twenty, 30 years from now, Amazon will seem like the Dark Ages,” Mr. Klososky said. But he noted that these advancements also introduce a new element of risk. “When we start experimenting with things we've never done before … that's where we learn hard lessons, that's where the risks come in,” Mr. Klososky said, citing the loss of intellectual property and product performance as key risks in the 3-D printing sphere. ####  ##### A key risk is the potential for a company to be put at a competitive disadvantage if a competitor embraces the technology first, he said. ####  ##### “You don't have a choice,” he said. “In some parts of the economy, you've got to learn how to do additive manufacturing. If you're too slow, you will lose market share.” ####  ##### Even developments in seemingly unrelated areas have potential implications for 3-D printing, he said. For example, self-driving cars, designed to prevent accidents, have increased the emphasis on the use of 3-D printing to create organs for transplant purposes, Mr. Klososky said. ####  ##### “Do you know what the organ donor people are scared to death of?” he said. “The No. 1 source of donated organs is car accidents. They get 75% of donor organs from car accidents. If you take away all the car accidents, there won't be donor organs anymore.” ####  ##### Pamela Meyer, entrepreneur, fraud examiner and author, discussed “liespotting” — the ability to see and understand clues that a person is lying, such as verbal dodges that include distancing language, specific denials and inappropriate tenses. ####  ##### “It's about knowing when there are red flags and when to drill down and ask harder questions,” she said. ####  ##### If risk managers suspect a person is being deceptive, they should ask themselves this question: “did they just go into convince mode?” Ms. Meyer said. ####  ##### “Step back,” she said. “Have they suddenly gone from being on your side and cooperating with you and providing you with information to all of a sudden try to convince. When they do that, what you want to do is let it rip. Let someone talk.” ####  ##### The fireworks malfunction occurred at about 7 p.m. Pacific Time at the RIMS' Meet 'n the Street outdoor event, which closed a block in San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter neighborhood so RIMS attendees could mingle in the street and restaurants. The fireworks display sent sparks into the crowd and smoke billowing through the street. ####  ##### A few injuries were reported though the extent was unclear, with many attendees taking cover in the restaurants on the block. ####  ##### Spokespeople for the San Diego fire and police departments could not be immediately reached for comment. RIMS officials were not available for comment Monday. #### "

"Keeping a grip on cyber risk, regulation increasingly challenging","Risk Management",""," ##### Forecasting critical risks is becoming increasingly more difficult, according to the 13th annual “Excellence in Risk Management” report released Monday by Marsh L.L.C. and the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. ####  ##### When asked how difficult forecasting critical risks is compared to three years ago, 32% of respondents in “Emerging Risks: Anticipating Threats and Opportunities Around the Corner” said it was more difficult, and 4% said that it was significantly more difficult, while 36% said it was the same, 26% said it was easier and 2% said it was significantly easier. ####  ##### But when asked whether predicting critical risks would be easier or more difficult three years from now, 40% said it would be more difficult, 8% said it would be significantly more difficult, while only 26% said it would be the same, 21% said it would be easier and 5% said it would be significantly easier. ####  ##### When asked which areas from which they thought the next critical risks for their organization would emerge, 61% of the respondents said cyber attacks, 58% said regulation and 40% said talent availability. When asked in what time frame the next critical risks would impact their organizations, 79% said that cyber attacks were already a significant concern. 71% said regulations already presented a significant concern and 53% said talent availability was already a significant concern. ####  ##### Growing interconnectedness “creates an environment where keeping up with evolving issues becomes more difficult,” the report said. ####  ##### “Therefore success in risk management now often comes to organizations that develop a multidimensional approach to identifying and managing complex risks. These organizations are able to not only see the risk around the corner but to understand that it may interact in not-so-predictable ways with existing risks.” ####  ##### The report is based on more than 700 responses to an online survey and a series of focus groups with leading risk executives conducted by Marsh and RIMS in January and February of this year. #### "

These are core to RIMS' mission, and experiencing it at the conference is energizing. These are my goals as it relates to my organization as well. Having the opportunity to engage my professional network of risk managers, underwriters, brokers and other vendors is invaluable. ####  ##### Q: What do you hope that the 200-plus students attending the conference will learn about the risk management discipline? ####  ##### A: I hope they will experience just how passionate our members are about risk management — and that you can have fun in your career. I also hope they learn the value of networking. I always encourage students to collect as many business cards as possible and engage those they meet on LinkedIn after the conference. Most risk leaders I know are more than willing to mentor and share experiences with students and Rising Risk Professionals. ####  ##### Q: What advice would you offer first-time attendees of the RIMS conference? ####  ##### A: Try not to get too overwhelmed. There is so much to see, do, learn and experience. While there's no way you can do it all, try to take advantage of all the conference has to offer. Attending the first-timers' orientation will also help you navigate the conference. ####  ##### Q: Finish this sentence: I will consider RIMS 2016 to be a success if… ####  ##### A: I go home tired! It will mean I've experienced much. #### "

"EEOC can subpoena employer of undocumented worker ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the authority to subpoena an employer in a discrimination complaint filed by an undocumented worker, despite the unanswered question of whether the agency ultimately has jurisdiction in the case, says an appeals court in reversing a lower court ruling. ####  ##### Elmer Escalante, an undocumented worker who was hired as a vacuumer at an Edgewater, Maryland carwash operated by Millersville, Maryland-based Maritime Autowash Inc. in May, 2012, filed a complaint against his employer with the EEOC in February 2014, charging discrimination on the basis of national origin and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in connection with its treatment of Hispanics, according to Monday’s ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Maritime Autowash Inc. ####  ##### The EEOC issued a subpoena in the case, then sought the approval of the U.S. District Court in Baltimore to enforce it when Maritime did not respond. The District Court held that because Mr. Escalante was an undocumented worker, he did not have standing to sue Maritime, and “thus left no viable basis for his EEOC complaint,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The trial court erred in refusing to authorize this “very preliminary step,” said a unanimous three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit. ####  ##### “Courts may uphold the agency’s subpoena authority without the need to pass on its view of Title VII’s coverage of undocumented workers,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The EEOC’s investigation of Mr. Escalante’s charges is “at least plausibly and arguably related to the authority that Congress conferred upon the commission,” said the ruling. “This is not a case where the agency went rogue or jumped the tracks and sought to investigate something unrelated to its statutory charge.” ####  ##### “The particular issue that Maritime presses — whether and to what extent Title VII covers undocumented aliens — is a novel and complex problem especially ill-suited to a premature and absolute pronouncement,” said the court, in remanding the case with instructions that the EEOC’s subpoena be enforced. #### "

"Reading of the Riot Act limits Sony claims in U.K.","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers, United Kingdom, General liability"," ##### Property owners and their insurers cannot claim compensation for consequential loss under the U.K.'s Riot Act, according to a recent court ruling. ####  ##### A decision by the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom's highest court, last week overturned a landmark appeal court decision that allowed Sony DADC, a Salzburg, Austria-based unit of Sony Corp., and its insurers to recover compensation from the police for consequential losses after a Sony distribution center was damaged during riots in London in 2011. ####  ##### In the case of The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime v. Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. (Europe) Ltd. & others, the Supreme Court ruled that consequential losses — such as loss of profit and loss of rental income — suffered by Sony, the freehold owner of a warehouse, and customers whose stock was destroyed are not covered by the U.K. Riot (Damages) Act 1886. ####  ##### The case concerns an incident on Aug. 8, 2011, amid a spate of riots that swept London and other areas of the United Kingdom after a controversial police shooting. ####  ##### A gang of youths broke into the Sony distribution center in Enfield, London, and stole goods and started a fire which destroyed a warehouse, stock and equipment. ####  ##### In May 2014, the Court of Appeal in London ruled that Sony's insurers could recover consequential losses from the police under the act. ####  ##### In the wake of that decision, and the large number of claims received after the 2011 riots, the government drafted an updated version of the act, the Riot Compensation Bill, which currently is being considered by Parliament. ####  ##### In its decision published Wednesday, the Supreme Court said it did not believe the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 was intended to extend compensation beyond physical damage to property. ####  ##### Chris Owen, head of disputes at Bristol, England-based law firm TLT L.L.P., which represented The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime — the Metropolitan Police — said that many claims for consequential loss were dependant on the outcome of the case. ####  ##### “The law was unclear in this area and largely written for a different era,” he said in a statement. ####  ##### “The Supreme Court ruling (…) has clarified that the compensation payable by the Metropolitan Police is limited to the costs of repairing the damage done to property during the 2011 London riots,” he said. ####  ##### “The Supreme Court judgment delivered by Lord Hodge in this case means that MSIEu will not be entitled to recover our outlay in respect of the consequential loss claim,” said a spokesman for Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Europe. ####  ##### “While disappointing, given the broader context of the substantial recovery already made regarding the material damage, overall this has been a successful outcome for MSIEu,” he added. #### "
"Facts drove award in lesbian firefighter's bias case but precedent far from clear","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### The jury weighed the facts, according to labor law experts, and awarded $800,000 to a lesbian former firefighter in Providence, Rhode Island, in a sexual orientation bias suit, in line with typical seven-figure awards in discrimination cases. ####  ##### But, far from a slam-dunk, it took four years to bring the suit to trial and appeals are pending, the experts point out, which sends a less clear message to workers in similar situations. ####  ##### Former firefighter Lori Franchina sued in U.S. District Court in Providence in 2012 alleging “intense, constant and prolific mistreatment” because she is a lesbian, resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court records. ####  ##### Ms. Franchina, who joined the fire department in 2002, alleged she was subjected to years of insults about her sexual orientation, given an obscene-sounding nickname, faced insubordination and disrespect and was physically assaulted by another firefighter. She alleged the harassment endangered her safety and that of victims she was helping, but her repeated complaints were ignored. ####  ##### Last week, she was  awarded more than $800,000 in damages by a federal jury for gender, sexual orientation and disability discrimination, as well as retaliation she suffered from male colleagues and city and union officials who failed to respond to her complaint. ####  ##### “The facts drive these cases,” said Gerald L. Maatman Jr., a partner at Seyfarth Shaw L.L.P. in Chicago, “and here was a situation where the jury thought that facts in front of them demonstrated that a person's rights were violated. Most risk managers, most (human resources) professionals working in America these days recognize that and have extensive policies and practices prohibiting discrimination and indicating to employees that if they have a problem to let HR know so the issue can be investigated and remediated where necessary.” ####  ##### A spokeswoman for the Providence Mayor's Office said in an email that the city intends to appeal the ruling, adding that it “remains committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination.” ####  ##### Marcia McCormick, director of the William C. Wefel Center for Employment Law, at the St. Louis University School of Law, said in an email that she does not believe “the verdict shows any major changes in workplace lawsuits.” ####  ##### “This case was simply the application of clear law to a pretty terrible situation,” Ms. McCormick wrote. “It may show others in similar situations that winning a discrimination case is possible, but considering that this case took four years to reach a verdict, and the department plans to appeal, which will add at least another year delay and could change the outcome, that message may not be very strong.” ####  ##### Neither Mr. Maatman nor Ms. McCormick expressed surprise at the size of the award. ####  ##### “Employment discrimination tends in certain situations to spike to seven figure awards,” Mr. Maatman said. “The facts of the case generally drive the results in terms of sizes of verdicts.” #### "

"Uber drivers remain independent contractors as lawsuit settles","Risk Management","Employment Practices, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Uber Technologies Inc. has agreed to pay up to $100 million to settle a class action lawsuit that resolves a major challenge to its business model by allowing the ride-hailing service to keep its California and Massachusetts drivers as independent contractors. ####  ##### The lawsuit had claimed that Uber drivers are employees and thus entitled to reimbursement of expenses. ####  ##### The case against Uber had been closely watched in Silicon Valley, as other companies in the on-demand tech economy share Uber's reliance on independent contractors. The class action had been scheduled for a trial in San Francisco federal court in June. ####  ##### ""We realize that some will be disappointed not to see this case go to trial,"" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for drivers. ####  ##### However, Ms. Liss-Riordan said the plaintiff drivers faced significant risks of losing if the case moved forward, particularly because a federal appeals court had recently agreed to review an order allowing Uber drivers to sue as a group. ####  ##### Nothing about the settlement prevents a future court, or U.S. labor authorities, from deeming Uber drivers as employees, she said in a statement. ####  ##### Driver deactivation ####  ##### Out of the $100 million proposed payment, $84 million is guaranteed to drivers. Uber could also pay an additional $16 million, but only if the company's valuation grows by 150% above its December 2015 financing round within a year after any initial public offering. ####  ##### Uber was valued at $62.5 billion in that December funding round. ####  ##### Uber agreed to some changes in its business practices, including the institution of a policy for deactivation of drivers, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in a blog post about the settlement. Some drivers had long complained that Uber arbitrarily terminated users from its platform. ####  ##### Uber is ""pleased"" that the deal ""recognizes that drivers should remain as independent contractors, not employees,"" Mr. Kalanick said in the post. ####  ##### The company also agreed to help create a drivers' association in both states. Ms. Liss-Riordan said that while such groups are not officially a union, they can act like a union in bringing grievances to management's attention. ####  ##### The settlement is similar to a separate agreement announced with Lyft Inc. drivers earlier this year, though the Uber agreement is much larger given that Uber has many more drivers. ####  ##### Over 450,000 U.S. drivers currently use the app each month, Mr. Kalanick said in the blog post. ####  ##### The Uber deal must be approved by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco. #### "

"Court sides with policyholders in complex litigation over asbestos claims ","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, Liberty Mutual, Claims Disputes, General liability"," ##### Policyholders scored a victory from New York's highest court, which has ruled in an asbestos case that the “all sums” method should be used to determine how much insurers owe them for their coverage. ####  ##### The unanimous Monday ruling also holds that policyholders can access their excess coverage after exhausting their underlying coverage by a method they favor. ####  ##### The Delaware Supreme Court asked the New York Court of Appeals to address the issue in the complex insurance dispute. ####  ##### The case stemmed from Cedar Falls, Iowa-based Viking Pump Inc. and Warren, Michigan-based Warren Pumps L.L.C. acquiring pump manufacturing businesses from Northbrook, Illinois-based Houdaille Industries Inc. in the 1980s, according to In the Matter of Viking Pump Inc. and Warren Pumps L.L.C. Insurance Appeals. ####  ##### The acquisitions later subjected Viking and Warren to significant potential liability in connection with asbestos exposure claims, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Houdaille had extensive multilayer insurance coverage from 1972 to 1985 that included coverage for these claims, according to the ruling. ####  ##### This included primary coverage totaling about $17.5 million with Boston-based Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. through successive annual polices, as well as additional layers of excess insurance through annual policies issued by various insurers totaling more than $400 million, including defendant insurers in the case. ####  ##### As the Liberty Mutual coverage neared exhaustion, litigation arose as to whether Viking and Warren were entitled to coverage under the additional excess policies that were issued by other insurers, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Eventually, the case reached the Delaware Supreme Court, which asked the New York court in 2015 to determine which allocation method should be used under New York law. ####  ##### Allocation methods ####  ##### Two basic types of allocation approaches are used in long-tail claims, including those in asbestos cases: the “all sums” and the “pro rata” methods. ####  ##### Under the all-sums approach, favored by policyholders, they can collect under any policy that is in effect during the period that the damage occurred up to the limits of that policy, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Experts say the all-sums approach means policyholders are not limited to a single year to claim coverage. ####  ##### Under the pro-rata allocation that the excess insurers proposed, an insurer's liability would be limited to the amounts incurred by the insured during the policy period. ####  ##### Experts say the pro-rata approach limits insurers' payments to the fraction of property damage that occurred only during their policy period. ####  ##### Courts have ruled both ways on this issue, the New York Court of Appeals said in its ruling. The court concluded that based on policy language the “all sums allocation is appropriate” in this case. ####  ##### The court also ruled the “vertical exhaustion” of the insurance coverage is appropriate in this case rather than “horizontal exhaustion.” ####  ##### Under horizontal exhaustion, all triggered primary and umbrella excess layers must be exhausted before tapping excess insurance. ####  ##### Under vertical exhaustion, the policyholders can access each excess policy immediately once the underlying policies' limits are depleted, even if other lower-level policies during different policy periods remain unexhausted. ####  ##### “In our view, vertical exhaustion is more consistent than horizontal exhaustion” under the policy language, the court ruled in siding with policyholders. #### "
"Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $55 million in talc-powder trial","Risk Management","Risk Management, D&O, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Johnson & Johnson was ordered by a U.S. jury on Monday to pay $55 million to a woman who said that using the company's talc-powder products for feminine hygiene caused her to develop ovarian cancer. ####  ##### The verdict, which J&J plans to appeal, was the second straight trial loss for the company, which is facing about 1,200 lawsuits accusing it of not adequately warning consumers about its talc-based products' cancer risks. ####  ##### Following a three-week trial in Missouri state court, jurors deliberated for about a day before returning a verdict for Gloria Ristesund. She was awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages. ####  ##### A J&J spokeswoman said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc. The company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety, she said. ####  ##### Ms. Ristesund said she used J&J's talc-based powder products — which include the well-known Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder — on her genitals for decades. According to her lawyers, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a hysterectomy and related surgeries. Her cancer is now in remission. ####  ##### Jere Beasley, whose firm represents Ms. Ristesund, said his client was gratified with the verdict. The jury's decision should “end the litigation” and compel J&J to settle the remaining cases, he said. ####  ##### The verdict followed a $72 million jury award from the same court in February to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene. ####  ##### That verdict, which J&J is appealing, sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits among plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as consumers familiar with J&J's powder products. But scientists have told Reuters the evidence of a real danger is inconclusive. ####  ##### Plaintiffs in talc litigation, which is concentrated in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, have accused J&J of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer. J&J has said it acted properly in developing and marketing the products. ####  ##### The only other case to be tried involving talc powder and ovarian cancer resulted in a mixed verdict in South Dakota federal court in 2013. While those jurors found J&J was negligent, they awarded no damages to the plaintiff, whose cancer was in remission at the time of the trial. #### "
"Video privacy suit over USA Today mobile app reinstated","Risk Management","Risk Management, General liability, Technology"," ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated putative class action litigation filed by a plaintiff who charged that a Gannett Inc. unit allegedly violated the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 by passing on personal information to a marketing firm. ####  ##### Gannett Satellite Information Network Inc. a unit of McLean, Virginia-based Gannett Inc., which publishes USA Today, also offers a proprietary software application “USA Today Mobile App” that allows users to access the newspaper's content, including video, on mobile devices, according to last week's ruling by the 1st U.S. District Court of Appeals in Boston in Alexander Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc., d/b/a/ USA Today. ####  ##### Each time the user views a video on the app, Gannet sends to San Jose, California-based Adobe Systems Inc., a software company that provides data analytics and online marketing services to its clients, the title of the video viewed, the GPS coordinates of the device at the time it was viewed and certain identifiers associated with the user's device, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Adobe takes this and other information it culls from a variety of sources to create profiles that may include  the user's name and address, age and income, “household structure” and online navigation and transaction history. ####  ##### Mr. Yershov downloaded and installed the app on his Android mobile device in late 2013. “At no time did he consent, agree or otherwise permit Gannett to disclose any information about him to third parties, nor did Gannett provide him with the opportunity to prevent such disclosures,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### “Nevertheless, each time Yershov watched a video clip on the app, Gannett disclosed to Adobe the title of the viewed video, Yershov's unique Android ID and the GPS coordinates of Yershov's device at the time the video was viewed,” said the April 29 ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Yershov sued Gannett in U.S. District Court in Boston, charging violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988. The lower court found that while the information Gannett disclosed concerning Mr. Yershov was “personally identifiable information” under the act, he was not a “renter, purchaser or subscriber” to Gannett's video content and was therefore not protected under the act. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the appeals court, which included retired associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter, unanimously overturned the ruling, and held Mr. Yershov could be considered a subscriber under the act. ####  ##### Mr. Yershov “plausibly pleads a case that the (act's) prohibition on disclosure applies,” said the ruling. The facts Mr. Yershov alleges “together with reasonable inferences drawn from those facts, plausibly describe a relationship between Yershov and Gannett, combined with a disclosure by Gannett, that ran afoul,” of the act, said the appeals court, in reversing the lower court ruling and remanding it for further proceedings. ####  ##### In 2015, Google Inc. and Viacom Inc. won the  dismissal of a nationwide privacy lawsuit filed under the Video Privacy Protection Act that accused them of illegally tracking the Internet activity of boys and girls who visited the website of cable TV channel Nickelodeon to send them targeted advertising. #### "

"U.K. banks ordered to review cyber security after SWIFT heist","Risk Management","Risk Management, Middle East/Africa, United Kingdom, Emerging Risks, Technology"," ##### (Reuters) — The Bank of England ordered U.K. banks to detail steps taken to secure computers connected to the SWIFT bank messaging network about two months after a still-unidentified group used the system to steal $81 million from Bank Bangladesh, according to three people familiar with the effort. ####  ##### The central bank sent the request to update cyber security measures to all banks it regulates in mid-to-late April, according to these people, who were not authorized to discuss the confidential communications. ####  ##### The previously unreported action marks the earliest known case of a central bank in a major economy to order its member banks to conduct a formal security review in response to the Bangladesh theft, which has shaken the global system for transferring money among both commercial and central banks. ####  ##### The Bank of England, one of the G10 central banks that oversee Brussels-based SWIFT, said it had no immediate comment. ####  ##### The FBI, authorities in Dhaka and private forensic experts are investigating the February cyber heist in Bangladesh where thieves raided a central bank account kept at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stealing $81 million. They installed malware inside the bank’s Dhaka headquarters that hid traces of their attack in a bid to delay discovery so they could access the funds, according to police and private security firms. ####  ##### The Bank of England told banks to conduct a “compliance check” to confirm whether they are following security practices recommended by SWIFT, which the firm recently reissued to members in the wake of the February heist, one of the people said. ####  ##### SWIFT declined to comment. The group has previously declined to release those guidelines, which were issued in private communications. ####  ##### The checks called for by the Bank of England include conducting what are known as user entitlement reviews, which ensure that only authorized staff have access to SWIFT applications and the service’s messaging gateway, that person said. ####  ##### Banks were also told to review computer logs for digital evidence known as “indicators of compromise,” including IP addresses and email addresses linked to recent attacks. ####  ##### Those indicators include technical details included in reports from several private cyber security firms, including Britain’s BAE Systems P.L.C. ####  ##### The communication from the Bank of England asked banks to respond by early May and provide details about plans for installing a security update to SWIFT Alliance Access software, according to the person. The messaging group last month released the update and asked members to install by May 16 ####  ##### Meanwhile, Sweden’s Riksbank on Wednesday called on all users of the central bank’s RIX payments system for large transaction to follow the SWIFT recommendations, a central bank spokesman told Reuters. ####  ##### Earlier this week, Singapore’s central bank asked banks to maintain a high level of security for their critical IT systems following recent cyber attacks using the SWIFT financial messaging system. ####  ##### In the Philippines, a senior central bank official said on Tuesday that regulators were crafting regulations to help banks and other financial institutions fend off cyber heists and minimize damage after any systems breach. #### "
"More football concussion lawsuits filed against NCAA","Risk Management","Risk Management, General liability"," ##### A Houston-based law firm said Wednesday it had filed six concussion claims against the NCAA and several Division I universities and athletic conferences. ####  ##### Raizner Slania L.L.P. said in a statement Wednesday that it had filed the lawsuits in various courts around the country seeking compensation on behalf of classes of former athletes from Penn State University, Auburn University, the University of Oregon, University of Georgia, University of Utah, and Vanderbilt University. ####  ##### Chicago attorney Jay Edelson of Edelson P.C., who is leading this latest effort to sue the NCAA, said 40 to 50 class-action lawsuits will eventually get filed on behalf of tens of thousands of ex-football players, according to media reports. ####  ##### A complaint was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. The filing lists Raizner, Mr. Edelson and three other attorneys as representing lawsuit plaintiffs. ####  ##### The plaintiffs charge that the defendants, including the NCAA, Penn State, the PAC-12 Conference, the Southeastern Conference, Vanderbilt University, and the Western Athletic Conference, breached their duties to student-athletes by concealing the dangers of concussions and failing to implement appropriate safety protocols. ####  ##### The filed complaint charges that until 2010, the NCAA and the SEC “kept their players and the public in the dark about an epidemic that was slowly killing their athletes.” ####  ##### “Over time,” the complaint said, “the repetitive and violent impacts to players' heads led to repeated concussions that severely increased their risks of long term brain injuries, including memory loss, dementia, depression, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ('CTE'), Parkinson's disease, and other related symptoms. Meaning, long after they played their last game, they are left with a series of neurological events that could slowly strangle and choke their brains.” ####  ##### The plaintiff in this particular case, Joseph Miller, played football from 1996 to 1998 at Auburn as a linebacker. ####  ##### “During hitting drills and regular practice scrimmages,” the complaint said, “Miller would hit so hard that he would see stars or black out, lose balance, and try to shake it off. These incidents happened two to three times per week during football practice and football season. Miller graduated from Auburn in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Over time, Miller began to experience the consequences of these blows. He began to lose memory and struggle with depression, anxiety and other diagnosed disorders.” ####  ##### Mr. Miller, the complaint said, “now suffers from deficits in cognitive functioning, reduced processing speed, decline in attention and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, and mood swings, among other issues.” ####  ##### The plaintiffs charge that the NCAA and the other defendants ignored the medical risks to college football players; aggravated and enhanced medical risks to college football players; failed to educate college football players about the link between traumatic brain injuries in amateur football and chronic neurological damage, illnesses, and decline; failed to implement or enforce any system that would reasonably have mitigated, prevented, or addressed these injuries that college football players suffered; and failed to timely implement “return to play” guidelines for student-athletes who sustain concussions. ####  ##### Even when defendants began to make changes, the law firm said, their policies remained flawed, “to the lifelong detriment of thousands of 18 to 22 year olds.” These deficient policies were implemented far too late for the putative class of college football players, the firm said, who suffered reasonably foreseeable harm as a result of the NCAA's actions, and those of its member institutions and conferences. ####  ##### “While (the lawsuit) is a major step for collegiate athletes who have been forced to deal with the lifelong impacts of concussions, we remain disappointed that the NCAA has at every turn sought to avoid accountability toward generations of players who entrusted their well-being to this organization,” Jeff Raizner, partner at Raizner Slania, said in a statement. “We fully expect to file a number of additional lawsuits in the coming weeks and months.” ####  ##### The NCAA did not respond to an email seeking comment by the time this story was posted. The NCAA is finalizing a $75 million settlement from a different lawsuit related to concussions. ####  ##### Last month a federal appeals court approved a class action settlement that may cost the National Football League $1 billion. The settlement, which is expected to cover more than 20,000 retired football players over the course of 65 years, releases all concussion-related claims against the NFL, according to the ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. #### "

"N.Y. brokers must pay $1.9 million for insider trading","Risk Management","Risk Management, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — Two former New York stockbrokers must pay $1.9 million for trading on confidential tips about an IBM Corp. acquisition, a federal judge ruled on Monday. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan ordered ex-Euro Pacific Capital Inc. brokers Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant to pay $546,458 and $1.34 million, respectively, after a federal jury found them liable in February on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges. ####  ##### Judge Rakoff ruled that a civil penalty was appropriate given the jury’s verdict. He rejected arguments by Mr. Durant that he should be forced to pay only $53,000, saying to accept his arguments would grant him “a significant undeserved windfall.” ####  ##### But Judge Rakoff declined to adopt even steeper penalties sought by the SEC, which asked to have Mr. Payton pay $1.03 million and Mr. Durant pay $2.57 million, citing their “challenging financial circumstances.” ####  ##### Lawyers for Messrs. Payton and Durant did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both men, who previously faced criminal charges only to have those dropped last year, are expected to appeal. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. ####  ##### The SEC alleged that in 2009, an attorney at IBM Corp.’s law firm told his friend, Royal Bank of Scotland Group P.L.C. analyst Trent Martin, that he was working on IBM’s $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. ####  ##### While the lawyer expected Mr. Martin not to tell anyone, Mr. Martin bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a Euro Pacific employee, the SEC said. ####  ##### Mr. Conradt then told four Euro Pacific colleagues, including Messrs. Payton and Durant, who made hundreds of thousands of dollars trading before the deal’s announcement, the SEC said. ####  ##### Federal prosecutors initially brought criminal charges over the case against five people, four of whom including Mr. Payton but not Mr. Durant pleaded guilty. ####  ##### But after a December 2014 appellate ruling limited the scope of U.S. insider trading laws, a federal judge threw out the guilty pleas and prosecutors dropped the case. The SEC, facing a lower burden of proof, chose to move forward in its case. #### "

He believes his company wanted him to quit voluntarily to limit severance payments he would have been entitled to, but he decided to stay on due to a sluggish economy. ####  ##### Despite earning a handsome salary for doing nothing, he described the four-year period as “hell” and “a nightmare” and said it caused multiple health issues, including ulcers and depression. He was ultimately fired after sustaining injuries from a car crash that forced him to go on seven-month sick leave, with his employer saying these absences interrupted work processes. ####  ##### Mr. Desnard believes the company should be held responsible for mental and other health damages and for his missing out on a promotion. A verdict in the case is expected July 27. ####  ##### However, a lawyer for Interparfum said there was no proof the company tried to bore him into quitting and accused Mr. Desnard of shifting gears to the boredom allegations after previously claiming to be suffering from burnout. ####  ##### If not for fragrance allergies, plenty of folks might have offered to switch jobs with Mr. Desnard. #### "

"Shipowner's piracy claim against war risk insurers dismissed ","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, European Union, Risk Management, China, United Kingdom, Claims Disputes, Marine"," ##### A judge in the High Court in London has thrown out a claim by a shipowner against a group of 10 war risk underwriters over the total constructive loss of a vessel that the owner claimed was boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden who then detonated a bomb on board. ####  ##### In the case of Suez Fortune Investments Ltd. & Piraeus Bank A.E. v Talbot Underwriting Ltd., Mr. Justice Julian Flaux ruled that reasons given by the shipowner for its refusal to hand over an electronic archive to lawyers were a “fabrication.” ####  ##### Even if the shipowner's story were true, the judge said, after the court had granted an extension to them for handing over the archive, he was “firmly of the view that there could not be a fair trial as between the owners and the insurers unless there was full and proper compliance by the owners with their disclosure obligations, including handing over the archive.” ####  ##### The case concerned the loss of the motor tanker Brillante Virtuoso, which was owned by Suez Investments and mortgaged by Piraeus Bank. ####  ##### The vessel suffered an explosion near its engine room while stopped in the Gulf of Aden on July 5, 2011. ####  ##### The owner claimed that the vessel was boarded by pirates who, when the vessel's engine, which had stopped, could not be restarted, detonated an explosive device in its purifier room. ####  ##### After a salvage effort, the ship was sold for scrap, and the owner instigated a claim against its war risk underwriters claiming the vessel was a total constructive loss. ####  ##### The underwriters resisted that claim, and court proceedings began in the commercial court in London in 2012. ####  ##### The parties agreed that the issue of quantum of claim should be tried before liability and, on Nov. 8, 2013, Mr. Justice Flaux ordered a split trial. ####  ##### In a judgment handed down on Jan. 15, 2015, Mr. Justice Flaux ruled that the vessel was a total constructive loss. ####  ##### The insurers contended that in the matter of liability for the loss, the shipowner was not entitled to claim under its policy because by delaying transit through the Gulf of Aden and/or calling at a port of place within the Gulf of Aden, it had breached Talbot's Gulf of Aden warranty, which stated that “when transiting, vessels/craft shall not call at any port or place or delay their passage in the transfer of cargo, stores, personnel or the like,” according to court papers. ####  ##### The insurers also claimed that the owner and manager of the vessel had breached the policy by failing to apply best practices to deter piracy. ####  ##### In March 2015, Norton Rose Fulbright L.L.P. in London, the law firm representing the insurers, served a defense and counterclaim to the owner and bank's lawyers, Hill Dickinson L.L.P. and Clyde & Co. L.L.P., alleging that the vessel had been lost “as a result of willful misconduct on the part of the owners,” the court papers show. ####  ##### In May 2015, the judge ordered the shipowner to disclose certain documents, which had been transferred to a USB flash drive, to the insurers' lawyers. ####  ##### The owners and their lawyers subsequently made several applications for an extension of the time needed for them to disclose the electronic archive held on that flash drive. ####  ##### A letter sent by Hill Dickinson in December 2015 set out the shipowner's reasons for its unwillingness to relinquish the flash drive, including that the drive contained information about an unrelated case, confidential information including telephone records and bank details about third parties, and information about the shipowner's health, among other things. ####  ##### The shipowner then applied for a further extension of time, until Feb. 29, 2016, contending that a lawyer for World Wide Worldwide Green Tankers Ltd., which previously had managed the vessel, would not hand over the flash drive for various reasons. ####  ##### In the meantime, the insurers alleged that the owner of the vessel had conspired with the charterers of the vessel to issue false bills of lading in order to deceive Chinese authorities into charging a lower import duty. ####  ##### A date for a hearing was set for March, but in a statement made on Feb. 2, the ship's ultimate owner, Marios Iliopoulos, claimed he could not travel to London from Greece for health reasons. ####  ##### He also was arrested by City of London Police for conspiracy to commit fraud — in an unrelated matter — and released on bail after several hours of questioning on April 12. ####  ##### The judge said in his Tuesday ruling that he had ignored those events in evaluating Mr. Iliopoulos' evidence in this case. ####  ##### Despite a claim by Hill Dickinson that the case could be heard without the electronic archive, on May 10 the judge threw the case out. #### "

"RIMS sounds alarm on latest OSHA injury-reporting rules ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Workers Comp Coverage, Disability"," ##### The new electronic recordkeeping rule issued by OSHA has drawn concern from the risk management community, the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. said Thursday. ####  ##### Inaccurate safety ratings, reporting redundancies and cyber exposures will result from the new rule on electronic record-keeping of workplace injuries released by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration that takes effect Jan. 1, 2017, the agency said in a statement. ####  ##### OSHA’s new rule requiring the publishing of employee injuries can increase litigation against an organization and can also be used against an organization by industry competitors, RIMS said in the release. ####  ##### The organization is also concerned about the ambiguity of the cause of a workplace injury potentially creating misconceptions about an organization’s workplace safety, the statement said. ####  ##### RIMS also listed OSHA’s web-based reporting application as an issue because of its additional cyber exposures. ####  ##### Because of the new rules, employers may also stop tracking minor incidents to lower incident rates, RIMS said in the statement. ####  ##### “Organizations practicing effective risk management track not only injuries resulting in loss of work, but also those injuries which may only require simply first aid treatment,” RIMS said in an official comment letter addressed to OSHA in 2014. “This practice allows an organization to track potential loss trends in order to avoid potentially larger issues. Should employers be required to publicly share this information, they would most likely stop trending these minor incidents in order to appear as if their incident rate is lower and more comparable to other companies,” the letter said. ####  ##### RIMS plans to continue to work with OSHA as it develops the final electronic reporting process, the statement said. #### "

"Battery bunny dispute re-energized","Risk Management","Off Beat"," ##### In the words of the marketing slogan, a trademark dispute between Energizer Holdings Inc. and Duracell Inc. over a pink bunny mascot “just keeps going and going.” ####  ##### According to Reuters, in the U.S. District Court in St. Louis last week, Judge Carol Jackson ruled that Duracell must face claims that its bunny mascot confuses customers and harms Energizer, which has used a bunny mascot on its packaging since 1989. ####  ##### Energizer's pink rabbit originally was a parody of a bunny used in Duracell advertisements. The Duracell bunny still is used in Europe and Australia but is not part of Duracell's branding in the United States. ####  ##### In 1992, Duracell and Energizer struck an agreement limiting Duracell's usage of the bunny in marketing in the United States and Canada. ####  ##### Duracell claimed that Energizer's lawsuit was a “thinly veiled” attempt to renegotiate that agreement, and said that it should not be liable if distributors of its batteries lawfully send bunny-branded packages to the United States. ####  ##### The judge, however, said that those assertions were not a proper basis for dismissing Energizer's suit. ####  ##### And so, much like the claims both manufacturers make about their batteries, there's still life in this dispute. #### "
"Zurich prevails in bid to deny business interruption coverage","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers, Zurich"," ##### Zurich American Insurance Co. is not obligated to pay $70 million in business interruption losses to a medical imaging firm in connection with the shutdown of a Canadian nuclear plant because of an exclusion in its all-risk property policy, a federal appeals court said Wednesday in affirming a lower court ruling. ####  ##### North Billerica, Massachusetts-based Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc., is a specialty pharmaceutical company that manufactures and distributes diagnostic medical imaging products, according to court papers in Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc. v. Zurich American Insurance Co. ####  ##### A key component in one of its products, the TechneLite Generator, is the molybdenum-99 isotope, which it indirectly obtains from the nuclear reactor at Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada, that is operated by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. ####  ##### Schaumburg, Illinois-based Zurich had issued an all-risk property insurance policy to Lantheus that was in effect from Jan. 8, 2009, through Jan. 8, 2010. ####  ##### The policy included coverage for “contingent business income loss,” including a $70 million sublimit in connection with the Chalk River reactor, according to court papers. Exclusions for losses not covered included one for corrosion. ####  ##### In May 2009, a breach led to the reactor's shutdown for 15 months. As a result, Lantheus had to cut back on production of it generators, and lost revenue and incurred extra expense in obtaining an alternate supply of Moly-99. ####  ##### Zurich denied the company's claim for coverage on the basis that the business interruption had occurred because of corrosion at the reactor, and therefore fell under its policy's exclusion. ####  ##### The company filed suit in U.S. District Court in New York, which ruled in Zurich's favor in April 2015. Lantheus appealed the ruling, and a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the lower court ruling. ####  ##### “The District Court's analysis is thorough and sound,” said the 2nd Circuit ruling. “There is no question of material fact” that the shutdown falls under the exclusion, “even accepting Lantheus' proposed version of events,” said the panel in affirming the lower court ruling. #### "

"'Too cute' yoga instructor can't make case in sex bias suit ","Risk Management","Off Beat"," ##### Being “too cute” doesn't make it as grounds for a gender discrimination lawsuit, says a New York judge, in dismissing case filed by a yoga instructor who was allegedly the unhappy target of a jealous wife. ####  ##### Dilek Edwards had been hired as a yoga and massage therapist by Charles V. Nicolai, co-owner of Wall Street Chiropractic and Wellness in New York, in April 2012, according to the May 11 ruling by the New York Supreme Court in Dilek Edwards v. Charles V.

But, unfortunately for Ms. Edwards, cuteness cannot be the basis of a gender discrimination charge, according to Judge Shlomo S. Hagler's ruling. ####  ##### “Even were this court to consider plaintiff's new theory of 'appearance-based discrimination,' this Court is constrained under the law to make a determination that defendants' behavior, no matter how abhorrent, fails to constitute gender discrimination,” said Judge Hagler, in dismissing the case. #### "

"Supreme Court attorneys' fees ruling hits home with EEOC suits","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Regulation, Claims Disputes, Claims Management, General liability"," ##### A U.S. Supreme Court ruling that holds a defendant does not need to win a case based on its merits to be considered the “prevailing” party and therefore entitled to attorneys' fees, will help employers in challenging EEOC litigation, experts say. ####  ##### The Supreme Court, however, did not issue a final ruling in CRST Van Expedited Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , because the EEOC had presented a new argument for the first time during oral arguments. ####  ##### So, the case was remanded to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis for further proceedings. ####  ##### The complex litigation began in 2007, when the EEOC charged Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based CRST with sexual discrimination and a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 while training 270 women. ####  ##### On the case's long, convoluted path, the U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids dismissed the cases of all but 67 of the women on a variety of grounds.  It then barred the remaining 67 women on the ground that the Commission had not satisfied its presuit requirements before filing the lawsuit. ####  ##### Ultimately, EEOC and CRST agreed that the trucking firm would pay $50,000 to settle the claim by the original plaintiff, Monika Starke. ####  ##### In the course of the extensive litigation, the District Court twice awarded CRST more than $4 million in attorney fees and was twice reversed by the 8th Circuit. ####  ##### In reversing the award the second time, the appeals court said a party can be considered “prevailing” and entitled to attorneys' fees only if there had been a ruling on the merits, which was not the case here. ####  ##### Because of the circuit court split over this issue, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case last year. ####  ##### “The Court now holds that a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant has prevailed,” said the court, in a ruling delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy. ####  ##### The Supreme Court, however, “has not set forth in detail how courts should determine whether a defendant has prevailed.” The question of whether CRST is the prevailing party “represents the central issue in this case.” ####  ##### A favorable judgment on the merits is not necessary for a party to prevail, said the ruling. “Common sense undermines the notion that a defendant cannot 'prevail' unless the relevant disposition is on the merits.” ####  ##### The defendant has “fulfilled its primary objective when the plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court's decision … There is no indication that Congress intended that defendants should be eligible to recover attorneys' fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits.” ####  ##### “Congress must have intended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivolous, unreasonable or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant's favor, whether on the merits or not,” the ruling said. ####  ##### The court, however, did not issue a final ruling on the matter because, it said, the EEOC had introduced a new argument that a defendant must obtain a “preclusive judgment,” or a final judgment no longer subject to appeal, to prevail. ####  ##### “The commission's failure to articulate its preclusion theory before the eleventh hour has resulted in inadequate briefing on the issue,” said the Supreme Court in remanding the case to the 8th Circuit for further proceedings. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement, “We are reviewing the decision, and we look forward to presenting our arguments to the Eighth Circuit.” ####  ##### “It's a victory for employers in the Title VII case … even though the Supreme Court in essence declined to issue a ruling on it and remanded it back to the District Court for further determination,” said Tina R. Syring, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg L.L.P. in Minneapolis, who was not involved in the case. ####  ##### The only reason it was remanded was “new arguments had been presented during oral arguments, and some of it had not been fully briefed,” said Ms. Syring. ####  ##### “This is a clear victory for employers,” said Kevin M. Kraham, a shareholder with Littler Mendelson P.C. in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court “clearly and unequivocally” provided “unambiguous instruction that a defendant should be able to recover atones fees when a court rejects the plaintiff's claim of discrimination, and that a win is a win, regardless of how the win comes about.” ####  ##### “The practical impact here is that employers will have available an additional way to challenge the commission's pre-suit conduct,” Mr. Kraham said. “In other words, if the EEOC were fulfilling its statutory mandate by investigating first, and then conciliating, instead of suing first, and then investigating, we wouldn't find ourselves where we are,” Mr. Kraham said. ####  ##### “Congress wanted to relieve employers of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous lawsuits, and the Supreme Court provided a means to an end for employers to address these types of suits,” he said. ####  ##### Miriam R. Nemetz, a partner with Mayer Brown L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., said however, the ruling will not have “a huge impact as a practical matter. Defendants are only entitled to attorneys fees in a pretty narrow range of cases, so I don't see an explosion of defendants getting awards of attorneys' fees in employment cases.” ####  ##### It is helpful, she added, however, in suggesting the EEOC could be subject to attorneys' fees if it does not satisfy presuit obligations, said Ms. Nemetz. ####  ##### It “is important as part of a constellation of cases establishing what defendants can do or what remedies they may have, if they feel the EEOC has not satisfied its conciliation obligations,” Ms. Nemetz said. #### "
"Supreme Court sides with worker on constructive discharge case ","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability"," ##### The clock starts ticking on how long a worker has to file a complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when he resigns, not when the discriminatory action occurred, said the U.S. Supreme Court in a Monday ruling. ####  ##### Marvin Green, an African-American man who worked for the U.S. Postal Service for 35 years, was passed over for a promotion to the vacant postmaster position in Boulder, Colorado, in 2008, according to the court's 7-1 ruling in Green v. Brennan, Postmaster General. Shortly after, he complained he was denied the promotion because of his race. ####  ##### “Green's relations with his supervisor crumbled following his complaint,” with tension peaking in December 2009 when two of his supervisors accused Mr. Green of intentionally delaying the mail, which is a criminal offense. ####  ##### On Dec. 16, 2009, Mr. Green and the Postal Service reached an agreement under which he agreed to either retire or accept a position at a salary considerably lower than he had had been earning. Mr. Green submitted his resignation on Feb. 9, 2010. ####  ##### On March 22 of that year, 41 days after submitting his resignation but 96 days after signing the settlement agreement, Mr. Greene contacted a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission counselor to report an unlawful constructive discharge. ####  ##### He eventually filed suit against the Postal Service in U.S. District Court in Denver. The Postal Service moved for summary judgment dismissing the case, arguing the 45 days that Mr. Green had as a federal employee to file a complaint started upon the signing of the settlement agreement, not his resignation. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver subsequently affirmed the lower court's ruling. ####  ##### The Supreme Court decided to hear the case because of a circuit split on this issue, according to the ruling, and held that the statute of limitations began with Mr. Green's resignation, not the signing of the settlement agreement. ####  ##### A constructive discharge claim “accrues only after an employee resigns,” said the ruling. “The constructive-discharge doctrine contemplates a situation in which an employer discriminates against an employee to the point that 'working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign,' ” said the court, citing an earlier ruling. ####  ##### “In this respect, a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee,” and the statute of limitations begins with the resignation, just as it does when the worker is fired, said the court, in overturning the appellate court ruling and remanding the case for further proceedings. ####  ##### Justice Clarence Thomas issued a dissenting opinion in the case, stating that the majority ruling “expands the constructive-discharge doctrine.” ####  ##### Brian D.

Citizens Bank, N.A. et al. ####  ##### Ms. Tang said her encounters with Mr. Mackey included a meeting where he discussed how he wished his Thai au pairs wore more revealing swimsuits. ####  ##### Ms. Tang said she received a negative performance review from Mr. Nackley, after he realized she was not responding to his advances. She was terminated in June 2011. ####  ##### Ms. Tang filed charges including sexual harassment against the bank in U.S. District Court in Boston, which granted the bank summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### A unanimous three-judge panel reinstated Ms. Tang's sexual harassment and retaliation claims Thursday. Discussing Mr. Nackley's comments about his Thai au pairs, the ruling said “the defendants note that Tang does not allege that he ever made blatantly sexual comments about them. ####  ##### “But Title VII requires no magic words to convert a verbal exchange into the stuff of sexual harassment … The context in which something is said may be just as important as what is said,” said the court in remanding the case for further proceedings. #### "

"Chubb unit seeks to rescind product liability policy","Risk Management","Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers, Chubb"," ##### A medical robotics firm continues to defend itself against efforts by a Chubb Ltd. unit to rescind its $15 million products liability policy because of an alleged failure to notify the insurer of pending litigation before obtaining the coverage, while an excess insurer has reached a settlement in the case. ####  ##### Chubb unit Illinois Union Insurance Co. contends in a suit originally filed in 2013 that it would not have issued its $15 million products liability policy to Sunnyvale, California-based Intuitive Surgical Inc. had it known the extent of possible litigation against the firm. ####  ##### But another insurer that had participated in the litigation, New York-based Navigators Specialty Insurance Co., which had an excess policy that provided $10 million in claims made coverage over Illinois Union's primary policy, reached a confidential settlement with Intuitive, according to court papers filed last week in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The case is Illinois Union Insurance Co. v. Intuitive Surgical Inc. ####  ##### In the most recent development, the District Court on Friday denied a partial summary judgment motion by Illinois Union to dismiss the case. ####  ##### According to the court papers, Intuitive Surgical' s one product line, the da Vinci Surgical System, has been in use since the early 2000s and had performed more than to 400,000 surgical procedures by 2012. ####  ##### The surgeon using the minimally invasive robotic system sits at a console away from the patient and manipulates robotic arms with a variety of micro-surgical attachments. Intuitive says the system causes less trauma and requires shorter hospital stays than traditional surgery. ####  ##### Illinois Union issued to Intuitive a products liability insurance policy in force from March 2013 through March 2014. The policy provided for $15,000-per-occurrence coverage and aggregate limits, including defense costs, over a $5 million-per-occurrence and aggregate self-insured retention. ####  ##### Illinois Union contends that though Intuitive disclosed 24 open claims when it applied for the insurance, it did not mention 734 “tolling agreements” with claimants. A tolling agreement waives a right to claim that litigation should be dismissed because a statute of limitations had run out. ####  ##### “It is axiomatic that you cannot buy insurance for a burning house,” say court papers submitted by Illinois Union. “Yet, that is exactly what Intuitive attempted to do here. The court should not allow it. ####  ##### “The undisputed facts show that Illinois Union is entitled as matter of law to rescind the products liability policy it issued to Intuitive based on concealment of material facts in the application process for the policy.” ####  ##### In its ruling Friday, Judge Jon S. Tigar said he was denying Illinois Union’s motion for partial summary judgment because there was a “material dispute” regarding concealment of the tolling agreements and whether Illinois Union knew about them before the policy was issued. Alternatively, said Judge Tigar, summary judgment is inappropriate because of underwriters’ “contradictory deposition testimony” in the case. #### "
"Valeant to pay $54 million settlement in drug kickback scheme ","Risk Management","Risk Management"," ##### (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. will pay $54 million to settle civil charges that its Salix unit paid illegal kickbacks to induce doctors to prescribe seven of its products, causing the submission of thousands of fraudulent reimbursement claims to the U.S. government. ####  ##### The accord announced Thursday by the U.S. Department of Justice covers alleged improper activity at the former Salix Pharmaceuticals Inc. from 2009 to 2013, predating its April 2015 acquisition by Valeant for more than $11 billion. ####  ##### Salix admitted and accepted responsibility for routinely paying doctors hundreds or thousands of dollars, or offering perks including lavish meals at restaurants such as Le Bernardin and Nobu, to attend some of its roughly 10,000 ""speaker programs,"" including many with little or no educational value. ####  ##### One doctor from Rochester, New York, allegedly received more than $200,000 for attending numerous events, including some where he was told not to do slide presentations and that dinner was the only gathering planned. ####  ##### ""Receipts from Salix's speaker programs — which were approved by managers — evidence the existence of speaker programs that were quite clearly happy hours,"" the government added. ####  ##### The Justice Department said the kickback scheme worked, as many attendees began prescribing Salix products more often. ####  ##### It said this led to thousands of false payment claims being submitted to Medicare and Medicaid, and two health care programs serving active and retired military personnel. ####  ##### ""Salix found a way to pay doctors money and treated them to fancy meals to push their drugs,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. ####  ##### The drugs and devices covered by the lawsuit are Apriso, Deflux, MoviPrep, OsmoPrep, Relistor, Solesta and Xifaxan. ####  ##### Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said that the company is pleased to settle and that the alleged misconduct ""involved personnel who are no longer with the company."" ####  ##### The payment marks an additional financial strain on Laval, Quebec-based Valeant, whose stock price has fallen more than 90 percent since August amid scrutiny over its business and accounting practices and high debt load. ####  ##### Salix's settlement resolves claims originally brought under the federal False Claims Act in two lawsuits by the physician Steven Peikin and four former Salix employees. ####  ##### Such lawsuits let whistleblowers bring cases on behalf of the U.S. government, and share in any recoveries. The government typically joins cases it considers stronger. ####  ##### According to settlement papers, Salix will pay $46.53 million to the United States and $7.47 million to resolve civil fraud claims by various U.S. states. #### "
"AIG, Travelers units not liable for payment on asbestos claims ","Risk Management","Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, AIG, The Travelers Cos., General liability"," ##### Units of Travelers Cos. Inc. and American International Group Inc. that had provided excess coverage to a now-bankrupt asbestos manufacturer are not obligated under their policies' terms to provide coverage until primary insurers have paid in full under their policies, says a bankruptcy court. ####  ##### New York-based Rapid-American Corp., which started getting sued for asbestos-related personal injury claims in 1974, settled many of the claims by the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2013, but it still had about 275,000 asbestos-related personal injury claims pending against it at the time, according to Tuesday's ruling by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Rapid-American Corp. et al. v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. et al. ####  ##### Beginning in 1998, Rapid-American reached settlements with nearly all of its insurers, but a number of them became insolvent and unable to pay the full limits of their policies, according to the ruling. An amount sufficient to reach the level of excess coverage provided under the policies at issue has not been paid, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Rapid-American plaintiffs in the litigation argue the excess policies at issue provide total limits of $64 million, according to the ruling. They contend it is unnecessary for the primary policies' underlying limits to be exhausted by actual payment before the insurers' excess liability coverage attaches. ####  ##### U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Stuart M. Bernstein, however, agreed with the insurers that this was not the case, based on the insurers' policy language. These policies “unambiguously require actual payment before liability attaches,” said Judge Bernstein in ruling in the insurers' favor on the issue. ####  ##### Decades after it became a major issue, insurers' ultimate asbestos liability remains unknown, according to a report issued in October 2015 by Oldwick, New Jersey-based rating agency A.M. Best Co. Inc. on asbestos and environmental losses. #### "
"Ruling against Greenberg raises stakes in Trump University case","Risk Management","Risk Management, AIG"," ##### (Reuters) — A ruling by New York's highest court in a fraud case against former American International Group Inc. Chief Executive Maurice R. Greenberg could affect the state's case against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his defunct Trump University. ####  ##### The New York Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could seek to recoup millions of dollars in bonus payments to Mr. Greenberg using the legal remedy called disgorgement. ####  ##### Unlike damages, which are used to compensate victims' losses, disgorgement requires a defendant to give back gains obtained from unlawful means. The ruling means that Mr. Schneiderman can go after $5 million he says Trump personally pocketed from the Trump University real-estate seminar venture. ####  ##### ""It doesn't help him,"" Jeffrey Goldman, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the New York case, said on Monday of the Greenberg ruling. But Mr. Goldman said Trump expected to win the case and could also try to limit the amount subject to disgorgement, such as by arguing that most of it was earned outside of New York. ####  ##### According to the state's 2013 lawsuit against Mr. Trump, filed in state court in Manhattan, Trump University was an unlicensed, illegal operation that bilked students of up to $35,000 each between 2005 and 2011. Two proposed class actions in California make similar allegations. ####  ##### Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly raised the Trump University litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated. He has also accused the federal judge overseeing the California lawsuits of being biased against him because of his ethnicity. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. ####  ##### In the Greenberg case, the state accused the former CEO of orchestrating sham transactions at AIG and misleading shareholders about the company's financial health between 2000 and 2005. Mr. Schneiderman is asking that Mr. Greenberg disgorge some $25 million in bonuses during that period, plus interest. ####  ##### Mr. Greenberg has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, David Boies, who represented Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore in the dispute over the 2000 election recount, had argued that disgorgement was not a remedy available to the New York attorney general under either the state's securities fraud law or another fraud statute. The Court of Appeals rejected MR. Boies' arguments. ####  ##### The ability to seek disgorgement may be useful to Mr. Schneiderman because the California cases involving Trump University may be resolved before the New York case. One is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28, just a few weeks after the Nov. 8 election. ####  ##### A settlement or judgment in those cases could undermine Mr. Schneiderman's claim for $40 million in damages because he is suing on behalf of many of the same former Trump University students. But disgorgement claims would not be affected. #### "
"French bank pays rogue trader for termination","Risk Management","Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Legislation & Regulation, Regulation, Risk Management, France, Financial Results, Claims Disputes, General liability"," ##### (Reuters) — A ""rogue trader"" who cost French bank Societe Generale billions of euros in losses won a wrongful dismissal case on Tuesday when a labor court ordered Jerome Kerviel's former employer to pay him €450,000 ($510,000) in compensation. ####  ##### The court, made up of equal numbers of representatives of employers and trade unions, ruled that the bank fired Kerviel without ""real and serious cause"" because it waited too long to dismiss him after becoming aware of his misconduct. ####  ##### SocGen lawyer Arnaud Chaulet branded the ruling ""scandalous"" and said the bank would appeal against a decision he said ran counter to the law. ####  ##### Kerviel, 39, was sentenced to three years in jail after being convicted by a Paris court in October 2010 for breach of trust and fraud in the loss of €4.9 billion in equity derivatives trades that went terribly wrong in 2008. ####  ##### Tuesday's ruling seemed bound to fuel controversy over the role of labor courts after the Socialist government dropped an attempt this year to limit by law the amount of damages they can award for wrongful dismissal. ####  ##### The trader has never denied masking his €50 billion positions, but contends his managers should have been aware of his actions, something the bank has always strenuously denied. ####  ##### France's labor code gives companies two months to sanction misconduct, but the tribunal found that his positions had been known since 2007 whereas Kerviel was dismissed in February 2008, his lawyer David Koubbi said. ####  ##### Koubbi told Reuters the decision ""restores justice and tears apart the story that Societe Generale has presented from the beginning"". ####  ##### The ruling comes as Kerviel faces a separate civil case due to start next week before an appellate court in Versailles about how much he has to pay the bank towards the losses. ####  ##### France's highest court of appeal upheld Kerviel's jail sentence in March 2014, but ruled that he was not liable for 4.9 billion in damages sought by the bank, opening the way for the civil trial to determine a fine. #### "

"Property/casualty insurers applaud Fed's proposed SIFI rules ","Risk Management","P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Regulation, Risk Management, AIG, MetLife"," ##### The property/casualty insurance industry is giving a generally favorable response to the Federal Reserve Bank's possible capital standards for systemically important insurance companies. ####  ##### The Fed issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on Friday, inviting comment on conceptual frameworks for capital standards that could apply to systemically important insurance companies and to insurance companies that own a bank or thrift. ####  ##### The Fed said in a statement that it was considering two approaches. “one approach — called the consolidated approach — that would apply to systemically important insurance companies, and a second approach — called the building block approach — for less complex insurance companies that also own a bank or thrift,” said the statement. ####  ##### “For systemically important insurance companies, the consolidated approach would categorize an entire insurance firm's assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments, apply appropriate risk factors to each segment at the consolidated level, and then set a minimum ratio of required capital,” said the Fed in the statement. ####  ##### The statement noted that the Fed currently supervises two systemically important insurance companies: American International Group, Inc. and Prudential Financial, Inc. A third insurer — MetLife Inc. — successfully challenged its designation as a systemically important financial institution in U.S. District Court, but the federal government is appealing. ####  ##### Property/casualty insurers generally hailed the Fed's move. ####  ##### The Property Casualty Insurers Association of America “applauds this major step forward in developing a group capital approach for domestic insurance holding companies subject to the Fed's supervision,” said Robert Gordon, PCI's Washington-based senior vice president, policy development and research, in a statement. “PCI will analyze the proposed rule and looks forward to continuing to work with the Fed. It is important to get this right, as the Fed's approach to capital standards may set a precedent for the state-based U.S. regulatory system and may also impact the international deliberations.” ####  ##### “Congress has been very engaged in expressing concerns about adoption of international insurance standards and the need to appropriately sequence the development of domestic capital standards that are pro-consumer and pro-competition,” added Mr. Gordon. “PCI will continue to engage with members of Congress who are developing legislation also addressing some of these issues.” ####  ##### “Today's issuance of the ANPR outlining the Federal Reserve's bifurcated approach to group capital for prudentially supervised insurance firms is an important next step in the implementation process of the Dodd-Frank Act,” said Leigh Ann Pusey, president and CEO of the Washington-based American Insurance Association, in a statement issued Friday. “It provided additional clarity on the Federal Reserve's underlying rationale and sets the stage for public input on its intended approach.” ####  ##### “For any additional regulation or standards for American insurers to be effective, it's vital that they be based on the state regulatory system,” said Charles M. Chamness, president and CEO of the Indianapolis-based National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, in a statement. “Relying on risk-based capital standards and allowing the use of statutory accounting principles will provide everything the Fed needs to monitor the solvency of those insurance companies under its jurisdiction not labeled systemically important.” ####  ##### “The frameworks we are considering would address all the risks across an insurance company's regulated and unregulated subsidiaries,” said Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen in the Fed statement. “I believe this proposal is an important step toward capital standards that are both appropriate for our supervised insurance firms and that enhance the resiliency and stability of our financial system.” #### "
"Texas on pace to set record-high insured losses from storms","Risk Management","Catastrophes, Aon Benfield, Catastrophe Modeling"," ##### The deadly storms that hit Texas this week have resulted in over $6 billion in insured losses, an industry analyst said, with the potential for more losses this weekend. ####  ##### Steve Bowen, Chicago-based director of Impact Forecasting, Aon Benfield Group Ltd.'s catastrophe modeling development team, said Thursday that Texas has already set a record for the highest severe convective storm-related insured losses for the year. ####  ##### “The industry in the state is already facing more than $6 billion in payouts from primarily hail-driven events and we have yet to hit the mid-point of the year,” Mr. Bowen said in an email. “It's a pretty staggering total. Most of those losses have occurred since the end of March, which further validates just how active this recent stretch has been for Texas.” ####  ##### Impact Forecasting said that more than 1,000 residents were evacuated and hundreds of water rescues were carried out by overwhelmed emergency services. News report have said that the most recent storm system has killed at least 12 people, including five soldiers stationed at the Fort Hood military base who died Thursday when their vehicle overturned in a flooded creek. ####  ##### Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a disaster for 31 affected counties on June 1. ####  ##### Mr. Bowen, who noted that current data is not available for the last three weeks, said there has not necessarily been an increase in frequency of hail or severe convective storm reports in Texas this year, but there have been particularly intense storms tracking over densely populated and exposed regions of the state. ####  ##### “When you consider how quickly the Texas population has grown in recent years,” he said, “the probability of severe weather impacting a populated area is also on the rise.” ####  ##### Citing U.S. Census Bureau data, the Office of the Texas Comptroller said that between 1980 and 2010, Texas' total population increased by 76.7%, from about 14.2 million to more than 25 million. ####  ##### Despite the losses, Mr. Bowen said the insurance industry is currently well positioned to be able to handle the volume of storm claims. ####  ##### “The last few years on the whole — thanks to a dearth of hurricane landfalls in the United States – has left insurance capital at record high levels,” Mr. Bowen said in his email. “With that said, any time states are faced with economic damages in the billions of dollars, it is going to put a strain on local budgets. Noninsurable damage to things such as infrastructure often adds up quickly.” ####  ##### The Insurance Council of Texas said the Lone Star State has been hammered by severe storms and flooding this year. Hailstorms in Fort Worth and Plano in March resulted in $1.3 billion in insured losses and an April 11 hailstorm in Wylie caused $300 million in insured losses. ####  ##### The council said auto and homeowner losses from last month's hailstorms in San Antonio are mounting as insured losses have reached $1.9 billion. This estimate does not include any commercial losses, such as schools, grocery stores, retail outlets or office buildings, which could push the total insured losses well over $2 billion. ####  ##### “Hail fell somewhere in Texas on 20 days in April and 25 days in the month of May,” Mark Hanna, the council's public relations manager, said in a statement. “Our continuing round of severe thunderstorms has also unleashed a record amount of rainfall that has resulted in major flooding in many parts of the state.” ####  ##### The council said that many insurances have already handled more wind and hail claims for this year than all of last year. ####  ##### The National Weather Service issued a hazardous weather outlook for South Central Texas on Friday, forecasting scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms on Saturday, which are expected to become more isolated to scattered by Sunday. A few storms could briefly become strong with small hail and gusty winds up to 50 MPH. ####  ##### While thunderstorm-related losses have been high in Texas this year, Mr. Bowen said these losses pale when compared with the costs that the state incurred from Hurricane Ike in 2008, which caused nearly $20 billion in damage in Texas alone, with public and private insurers picking up more than $12 billion of the losses. #### "

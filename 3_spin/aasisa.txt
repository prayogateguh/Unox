"BP steps up spill payments protest with ad campaign";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental";" ##### (Reuters) — Britain's BP P.L.C. has stepped up its campaign for a revision of the way compensation for its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill is calculated by placing advertisements in leading newspapers ahead of a July 8 appeal court hearing in the United States. ####  ##### The oil major's advertisements in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post back its attempt to put a lid on payments in the billions of dollars, which the company has said could leave it ""irreparably harmed."" ####  ##### BP has no control over its payments to claimants, having agreed to a compensation formula and framework in a legal settlement covering certain personal and business liabilities. ####  ##### While the company insists that the formula is being misinterpreted, the court-appointed claims administrator disagrees and its process has been upheld by the New Orleans federal court that is dealing with a host of legal issues surrounding the 2010 disaster. ####  ##### BP hopes to have that decision overturned at its July 8 hearing in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ####  ##### ""Trial lawyers and some politicians are attempting to capitalize on this misinterpretation by encouraging the submission of thousands of claims for inflated losses, or losses that do not even exist,"" BP said in its advertisement. ####  ##### ""Whatever you think about BP, we can all agree that it's wrong for anyone to take money they don't deserve. And it's unfair to everyone in the Gulf — commercial fishermen, restaurant and hotel owners, and all the other hard-working people who've filed legitimate claims for real losses."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In a separate development last week, BP sought to use allegations against a member of claims administrator Patrick Juneau's team to back its case for a full review of the claims process. ####  ##### Mr. Juneau placed team member Lionel Sutton on administrative leave and filed a report to the U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans about allegations that Mr. Sutton had referred claimants to other lawyers in exchange for a cut of subsequent compensation. ####  ##### Mr. Juneau later issued a statement anouncing that Mr. Sutton had resigned and that the allegations would be investigated internally. ####  ##### BP described the affair as ""troubling"" and repeated its request for ""a comprehensive and public audit of the settlement program by a reputable national accounting firm."" ####  ##### Mr. Sutton did not respond to phone calls and emails requesting comment, but Associated Press last week quoted him confirming that he had been suspended. ####  ##### Much of BP's argument hinges on an interpretation of accountancy terms that the company says is too loose. One of the key triggers for a so-called business economic loss claim is the ability to show a lower revenue, higher expense, or both, during and/or after the oil spill, compared with other periods. ####  ##### Proof of a connection with the spill itself is not necessary in most cases. ####  ##### BP argues that a loose definition of what constitutes revenue and expenses produces more volatile figures and is allowing businesses to be classed as eligible claimants even though there is no real longer-term impact on profit. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The company's case against the compensation payouts was backed by a group of accountancy professors last month. ####  ##### However, BP has said that the nature of the disputed compensation payments — many small, individual payouts — means that recovering them through further litigation would be next to impossible. ####  ##### In April, BP added $500 million to its estimate of compensation payouts under the settlement based on what it knows so far. Its best guess is for a total of $8.2 billion of business economic loss and other compensation claims, with only $1.7 billion left in the $20 billion pot it set aside for paying these and other costs. ####  ##### BP has a total of $42.2 billion set aside in its accounts for cleanup costs, fines and compensation for the oil spill, which killed 11 men and devastated the Gulf of Mexico coastline. ####  ##### The extra compensation payouts BP is contesting may end up as a relatively small part of the final bill. Other developments, such as being found grossly negligent rather negligent, could increase its liability by much more. #### "

"Nuveen Investments funds sue insurance giant AIG";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, AIG";" ##### A group of Nuveen Investments Inc. funds sued American International Group Inc. Tuesday, alleging that the insurance company committed a subprime mortgage market-related fraud that cost the funds billions of dollars in losses. ####  ##### The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that from March 2006 to September 2008, AIG violated securities laws and engaged in “common law fraud and unjust enrichment” with respect to issuing credit default swaps, which were designed to provide a sort of insurance on collateralized debt obligations that were backed by subprime mortgage bonds and other securities. ####  ##### In September 2008, the federal government extended what eventually became a $182 billion bailout to AIG, saving the company from collapse under the weight of its billions of dollars in losses on the swaps. The value of AIG stock and bonds plummeted with the event. The government has since sold most of the 80% AIG stake it received in the transaction. ####  ##### The Nuveen funds, which had purchased AIG stock and bonds, allege that the company and former top executives committed fraud by making false and misleading statements to investors about the losses that were bearing down on it. ####  ##### AIG and Chicago-based Nuveen declined to comment. ####  ##### Other institutional investors, including investment funds and pension funds, also have sued AIG alleging the same wrongdoing; those cases were consolidated in U.S. District Court in New York, where the plaintiffs are seeking class action status. ####  ##### “Even though AIG was aware of the downward turn of the mortgage market, it did not undertake to hedge the CDS portfolio because doing so would have undercut the profitability of the business,” the lawsuit says. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### By late 2005, AIG stopped writing swaps for CDOs, but by then AIG was already insuring about $80 billion of the securities, most of which were backed by the more risky subprime mortgages, the lawsuit says. ####  ##### “Not only was AIG brought down by 'unconscionable bets' that went terribly wrong, plaintiffs suffered tens of billions of dollars of losses, at the least, based on false and materially misleading statements that AIG, certain of its executives, directors, underwriters and outside auditor made concerning the company's financial results, business operations and condition,” the Nuveen funds said in the lawsuit. ####  ##### The U.S. Justice Department decided not to take action against certain AIG executives involved in the company's swap activities despite a two-year investigation, according to reports in 2010. ####  ##### The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission extended monitoring of the company following the subprime crisis. The monitoring began in connection with the 2006 settlement of separate unrelated fraud charges brought by the New York attorney general. ####  ##### Lynne Marek writes for Crain's Chicago Business, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Demand for insurance-linked securities spurs innovative investment structures";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### Stronger demand for insurance-linked securities is putting pressure on traditional reinsurers, spurring innovation as reinsurers and brokers develop novel investment structures for institutional investors and the hedge fund managers who invest on their behalf. ####  ##### This surge in insurance-linked securities is evident in the increased issuance of catastrophe bonds. According to a Swiss Re Ltd. report released in July, the total value of outstanding catastrophe bonds as of July 1 was $17.1 billion, exceeding the previous full-year record of $17 billion set in 2007 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ####  ##### Unlike the upswing in the catastrophe bond market after Katrina, however, market dynamics now are being driven by investor demand from a variety of new sources, most notably institutional investors and traditional money managers. ####  ##### “Everything is changing in the insurance-linked securities market, from the size of deals to the players involved,” said Tim Faries, a partner in the insurance group at Appleby Global Group Services Ltd., a Hamilton, Bermuda-based financial services firm that advises on insurance-linked securities. ####  ##### “Historically, our market was dominated by single-strategy hedge funds,” said Judith Klugman, head of insurance-linked securities distribution and sales for Swiss Re. “They have been extremely successful and still make up a big percentage of our market, but that is beginning to shift as more generalist money managers take an interest.” ####  ##### The mix of institutional investors investing in catastrophe bonds and other securities linked to insurance now includes more pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “What we've seen is that pension funds have largely been behind the capital that has continued to flow into the market,” said Chicago-based Paul Schultz, CEO of Aon Benfield Securities. ####  ##### Institutional investors increasingly have become enamored with insurance-linked investment strategies because catastrophe bond annual investment returns tend to fall in a range between 7% and 8%, topping ho-hum returns of traditional fixed-income securities in a low interest-rate environment — and they are uncorrelated with financial markets. The biggest investment area for institutions and hedge funds has been catastrophe bonds, by far the largest segment of insurance-linked securities, but there are other investments such as industry loss warrants and sidecars. ####  ##### Increased transparency and education, as well as structural changes, have increased investor and issuer comfort with insurance-linked securities, sources said. ####  ##### For example, a higher percentage of catastrophe bonds now use indemnity triggers, based on the losses suffered by the bond issuer and have gained popularity at the expense of both parametric triggers, which rely on measures such as wind speed to trigger the bond and indexed triggers, based on an industrywide index of losses, Ms. Klugman said. ####  ##### “What we are finding is that as our investors have become more sophisticated, there is a greater acceptance of indemnity triggers,” she said. ####  ##### Two of the most recent institutional investors to jump into insurance-linked securities are: ####  ##### • The $13.2 billion West Virginia Investment Management Board, Charleston, which invested $40 million in Chicago-based Elementum Advisors L.L.C.'s specialist catastrophe reinsurance hedge fund; and ####  ##### • The 23 billion New Zealand dollar ($18 billion) New Zealand Superannuation Fund, Auckland, which committed up to $275 million in London-based Leadenhall Capital Partners L.L.P.'s property catastrophe hedge fund, having previously invested $250 million in 2010 in Elementum's hedge fund. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On a short-term basis, Aon Benfield's Mr. Schultz said demand for catastrophe bonds has experienced ebbs and flows. ####  ##### “In the early part of the year, there was significantly more capital looking to be deployed than transactions coming to market. Since then, we've seen a healthy stream of issuances, and supply and demand is now about the same,” Mr. Schultz said. ####  ##### Aside from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund's outsized $500 million investment, most institutional reinsurance allocations are fairly small, in the $30 million to $50 million range, sources said. ####  ##### Over the long haul, the aggregation of even such small investments has the potential to crowd out the traditional sources of reinsurance market capital, sources said. ####  ##### Currently, only 15% of the total $300 billion property catastrophe reinsurance market now is from nonreinsurance industry sources known in the industry as “alternative capital,” according to an estimate by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research in its “The Search for Creative Destruction” report distributed Aug. 7. However, if pension funds with an estimated $2 trillion of aggregate assets allocated just 50 basis points of their funds to property catastrophe investments, the resulting $100 billion would be more than double the existing amount of alternative capital in the reinsurance industry, according to the report. ####  ##### “The total amount of pension fund assets so dwarfs the size of the whole reinsurance industry. Even a small fraction of those trillions would completely swamp the reinsurance industry,” said Michael Luft, managing director and consultant for insurance-linked securities at investment consultant Rocaton Investment Advisors L.L.C., Norwalk, Conn. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The volume of new capital flowing into their reinsurance space already has altered the supply/ demand dynamic and driven the cost of issuing bonds down relative to traditional reinsurance, said David Foley, global practice leader of actuarial and advanced analytics for Deloitte Consulting L.L.P. ####  ##### “The frictional cost of catastrophe bonds is falling,” Mr. Foley said. “So even from a price standpoint, they are becoming competitive with traditional reinsurance.” ####  ##### This diminishing price differential has prompted differing reactions from reinsurers. ####  ##### “Some traditional reinsurance players are following the adage of 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em' and investing in building teams that are capital markets desks,” Appleby's Mr. Faries said. ####  ##### Conversely, during a July conference call with equity analysts, Evan Greenberg, CEO of Zurich-based insurer and reinsurer Ace Ltd., said his insurance company was being more selective about writing reinsurance as the influx of alternative capital has exerted downward pressure on rates, especially in catastrophe-exposed regions. ####  ##### “You see alternate capital coming in, capital markets in addition to traditional players,” Mr. Greenberg said. “So you've got that pond, with more drinking out of it.” ####  ##### Bill Kenealy is an associate editor at Business Insurance; Christine Williamson is a senior reporter at sister publication Pensions & Investments. #### "
"Kevin Hogan returns to AIG as head of global consumer insurance";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, AIG";" ##### American International Group Inc. has rehired New York-based Kevin Hogan as CEO of its global consumer insurance division. ####  ##### Mr. Hogan, who will become a member of the AIG executive group, had previously worked for AIG from 1984 to 2008, but was most recently CEO of global life insurance for Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., AIG said in a statement Wednesday. ####  ##### Additionally, AIG’s global life insurance business will become part of AIG global consumer insurance, according to the statement. ####  ##### “I’m delighted to welcome Kevin Hogan back to AIG,” Robert H.

"Insurers don't have to pay for Land O'Lakes environmental cleanup: Court";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers, Liberty Mutual, The Travelers Cos.";" ##### Units of Liberty Mutual Holding Co. Inc. and Travelers Cos. Inc. initially breached their duty to Land O'Lakes Inc. for failing to provide defense coverage for an environmental cleanup, but Minnesota's statute of limitation bars the agricultural cooperative from pursuing litigation on the issue, an appellate court ruled Thursday. ####  ##### Midland Cooperatives Inc. owned an oil refinery in Cushing, Okla., from 1943 until 1977, according to the ruling in Land O'Lakes Inc. v. Employers Insurance Co. of Wausau et al. by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. ####  ##### In 1977, the facility was sold to Hudson Oil Refinery Co., which abandoned the refinery in 1982 and went bankrupt in 1984. Arden Hills, Minn.-based Land O' Lakes acquired Midland in 1982, including the now-dormant refinery, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In July 1999, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the refinery as a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. ####  ##### In January 2001, the EPA sent Land O'Lakes a special notice letter informing it that it was considered a “potentially responsible party” under CERCLA and thus potentially liable for cleanup costs at the site. ####  ##### Land O'Lakes responded to the letter by asserting Hudson Oil, not Midland, caused any contamination at the refinery site, but nevertheless notified Wausau, a unit of Boston-based Liberty Mutual and Hartford, Conn.-based Travelers Indemnity Co. of the EPA's claims and sought defense and indemnification. Both insurers denied coverage. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In 2008, the EPA sent Land O'Lakes a second special notice letter inviting it to enter negotiations regarding the continued cleanup activities at the refinery. Land O'Lakes reiterated its denial that Midland had caused any contamination at the site and again asked the insurers for defense and indemnification, which both once again denied coverage. ####  ##### Land O'Lakes did initiate cleanup activities at the site. It filed breach of contract lawsuits against the insurers in 2009. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit upheld a ruling by the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis that Minnesota's six-year statute of limitations began with the EPA's 2001 letter, and therefore the cooperative could not pursue its litigation. ####  ##### Land O'Lakes argued that the 2001 letter was nothing more than an “invitation to participate in an investigation into whether remediation would be necessary at the refinery site. We disagree,” said the ruling. ####  ##### Instead, the 2001 letter “marked the beginning of an adversarial administrative process that ultimately sought to impose liability upon Land O'Lakes for remediation costs associated with the refinery site,” said the unanimous ruling. ####  ##### “We agree with the district court that the insurers breached their duty to defend in 2001” because the EPA's later “was a 'suit' for arguably-covered damages as contemplated under the pertinent (comprehensive general liability) policies” and that the EPA's 2008 letter “was not the commencement of an entirely new enforcement action. We, therefore, hold that 2009's duty-to-defend claims were barred by the Minnesota statute of limitations.” ####  ##### The appellate court also upheld the lower court's ruling that the owned-property exclusion in the policies relieved the insurers from any duty to indemnify Land O'Lakes for the cleanup costs. #### "
"Blackstone to pay $85M to settle lawsuit over IPO";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — Blackstone Group L.P. has agreed to pay $85 million to settle an investor class action lawsuit accusing the private equity giant of not disclosing bad investments before its $4.7 billion initial public offering in 2007. ####  ##### The proposed deal follows more than five years of litigation between investors and Blackstone and helps the world's largest private equity firm avert a rare securities class action trial that was due to begin Sept. 16. ####  ##### The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, also covers claims against individuals including Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone's chief executive. ####  ##### Blackstone spokesman Peter Rose declined to comment. The company continues to deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, court papers state. ####  ##### Lawyers for the plaintiffs said in court papers the settlement represents about 12 percent of the $691.5 million they believed were achievable at trial. ####  ##### Investors contended Blackstone did not properly disclose at the time of offering that its investments in a bond insurer, a semiconductor company and real estate were declining in value. ####  ##### As a result, investors alleged that there was an increased risk Blackstone's potential performance fees would be ""clawed back"" by limited partners. ####  ##### Blackstone offered up 153 million common units at $31 a piece at the time of its June 2007 IPO. By the time plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in October 2008, they were trading at about $7.75 a unit. ####  ##### Shares in Blackstone closed up 25 cents, or 1.17%, at $21.65 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Harold Baer, who must approve the settlement, initially dismissed the case in September 2009. ####  ##### But in February 2011, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York revived the case.

"'Not that pretty' city attorney can pursue sex, age discrimination charges";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A terminated attorney for the city of Evanston, Ill., who was told she was “not that pretty” by one of her supervisors, can pursue sex and age discrimination charges against the city, says a federal judge. ####  ##### Elke Tober-Purze had received excellent performance evaluations and was never disciplined before her termination in August 2010, according to a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge John W. Darrah in Chicago in Elke Tober-Purze v. City of Evanston that was issued Aug. 21 but publicized only this week. ####  ##### “In late 2009, despite her superior experience, Evanston hired W. Grant Farrar as its city attorney, instead of Tober-Purze or many other qualified females,” said the ruling. “Many female employees were terminated during Tobe-Purze's employment with Evanston. Moreover, many of the colleagues terminated during her employment were much older than the attorneys who replaced them. Since Farrar has been city attorney, he has hired male and younger female attorneys to replace Tober-Purze and other older, female attorneys,” says the ruling. ####  ##### In ruling that Ms. Tober-Purze could pursue her sex discrimination charge, the ruling says Ms. Tober-Purze was paid less than her male counterparts and did not receive the promotions they did. ####  ##### “She was also told by her superiors that she was ‘not that pretty’ and one superior told Tober-Purze that the previous attorneys he had hired were ‘smart … good-looking ... just gorgeous … (and wore) tight sweaters ... short skirts,’” said the ruling. She and other female attorneys were also told by a superior that “it’s been all downhill since women got the vote,” the ruling said. ####  ##### The judge also held Ms. Tober-Purze, who is more than 40 years old, could pursue her age discrimination charge as well as a charge that the city had violated the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act for not paying accrued vacation and sick time. The court said she could not pursue her claim for retaliation under the Wage Act because a private cause of action for retaliation did not exist under the statute when she was terminated in 2010. #### "
"Judge rules for Port Authority in asbestos defense involving AIG unit";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, AIG";" ##### A New York Supreme Court judge has granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, holding that an insurer's duty to defend covers an entire underlying action even if only some of the claims fall under the policy. ####  ##### The ruling involves a case brought by American Home Assurance Co. against the Port Authority, Alcoa Inc., Mario & DiBono Plastering Co. Inc., Tishman Speyer Properties L.P., Tishman Speyer Properties Inc. and other Tishman companies. ####  ##### The insurer's suit sought a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the defendants for asbestos-related injury claims stemming from the construction of the original World Trade Center. ####  ##### In its motion, the Port Authority said litigation against it alleged injury at the World Trade Center and non-WTC sites, but that American Home Assurance, a unit of American International Group Inc., had unilaterally begun limiting its defense obligations to the portion of defense costs dealing only with World Trade Center-related claims. ####  ##### American Home opposed the motion. It also argued that the policy had been exhausted, terminating its duty to defend. ####  ##### However, in her Aug. 15 ruling, Judge Eileen Bransten held that under New York state law, the duty to defend “extends to the entire action,” citing precedent that “if various grounds are alleged, some within and some without the coverage of the policy,” the insurer has a duty to defend the action on behalf of the insured. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The judge held that the Port Authority's right to recover the entire amount expended by American Home in defending the action can't be diminished because there might be additional insurers that also have a duty to defend. ####  ##### “The court concludes that American Home's duty to defend extends to the entirety of those WTC asbestos claims asserting claims covered by the policy,” the judge wrote. ####  ##### Regarding American Home's assertion that the policy had been exhausted, the judge ruled that the duty to defend continues even after the policy's indemnity limits are exhausted unless the policy expressly limits the duty to defend. ####  ##### “American Home points to no provision of the policy terminating defense costs upon exhaustion of the liability limit,” the judge wrote. “A policy may expressly limit the duty to defend; however, American Home points to no such limitations here.” ####  ##### In her ruling, the judge also granted the Tishman defendants' motion to dismiss counts against them in the American Home action and denied a motion by Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., which had issued policies to Mario & DiBono Plastering, to intervene in the case. #### "
"Zurich Insurance CFO named Ackermann in suicide note";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Zurich, Switzerland";" ##### (Reuters) — The finance chief of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., Pierre Wauthier, named chairman Josef Ackermann in his suicide note, the company confirmed on Friday as it pledged to investigate whether he had been put under undue strain before his death. ####  ##### The insurer has been thrown into disarray since company veteran Mr. Wauthier was found dead at his family's lakefront home on Monday and the subsequent resignation of former Deutsche Bank A.G. boss Mr. Ackermann three days later. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann, one of Europe's top financiers, quit after Mr. Wauthier's family shared the contents of the letter with senior executives at the firm, a source told Reuters. Mr. Wauthier explicitly blamed Mr. Ackermann in the note for putting him under pressure, said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann has described the allegations as ""unfounded"" but said he would leave to avoid damaging Zurich's reputation. He took over as chairman last year. The insurer said Mr. Ackermann had made a personal decision to leave. ####  ##### Sources said Messrs. Ackermann and Wauthier had clashed ahead of the company's second-quarter results in August over how they were presented. ####  ##### Mr. Wauthier, finance chief since 2011, mentioned the presentation of the results in his suicide note, a company source added. ####  ##### In a conference call with investors, the company said there was no link between Mr. Wauthier's death and Zurich's financial performance. ####  ##### ""We stand by everything we said at the half year,"" Chief Executive Martin Senn said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Acting Chairman Tom de Swaan said the company would investigate the circumstances leading up to Mr. Wauthier's death. ####  ##### ""The board sees it as its prime responsibility to look into the question as to whether there was undue pressure placed on our CFO,"" he said, adding that he was not aware of any inappropriate behavior by Zurich's board members. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann's abrupt departure comes on top of a period of flux among Zurich Insurance's upper echelons. Its life insurance chief, Kevin Hogan, left two weeks ago to join American International Group Inc. as head of consumer insurance, and former general insurance head Mario Greco quit a year ago to lead Italian insurer Generali Group. ####  ##### ""The board is well aware of the need to strengthen the management team, and I consider this to be our top priority,"" said Mr. de Swaan, who was vice chairman under Mr. Ackermann. ""Our focus is on ensuring the continued stability of the company."" ####  ##### The company has set up a telephone hotline for employees shaken by the death of Mr. Wauthier, a married father of two. ####  ##### Shares in the group, the worst performing insurance stock in Europe over the past six months, rose over 1.5% after the conference call, snapping a four-day losing streak, with investors saying Mr. Ackermann's departure would not derail things. ####  ##### ""Ackermann has not been there for a long time. He's not the architect of anything, and this is not a company in a big transition,"" said one Top 20 shareholder. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The investor, who declined to be named, said Mr. Ackermann's openness about why he was resigning was actually reassuring. ####  ##### ""I was quite surprised at the statement and the references to Pierre's family. Normally, you see a holding statement,"" he said. ####  ##### ""What he said was better than if he just walked without saying anything, because then it would look like perhaps there was a hole or that something was wrong with the accounts. Not so much a cover-up but that something might have been found in the company."" ####  ##### The suicide scandal comes at a tough time for the company. Two weeks ago, Zurich reported a 17% slide in first-half net profit and it said low investment returns meant it would miss some targets. ####  ##### The company's shares had fallen close to 11% in the past six months, compared with a near 10% increase in the European insurance index. ####  ##### A former colleague of Mr. Wauthier's said there had been pressure within the company to turn around its share performance. ####  ##### Mr. Ackermann took on the chairmanship of Zurich Insurance after failing to become chairman at Deutsche Bank. ####  ##### There was some surprise that the Swiss national opted for a relatively low-profile role in insurance rather than aiming for a top spot at one of Switzerland's banks. ####  ##### But the 65-year-old moved to shake up Zurich Insurance, which he felt was lagging behind European peers. Unlike previous chairmen, he took a very close interest in the finer details of results and accounts. ####  ##### Former colleagues of Mr. Ackermann say he does not court confrontation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""I have never seen Mr. Ackermann lose his cool at a meeting. But if you were underperforming, he had a way of communicating it without having to spell it out in a way which was personal. You talked about the numbers, and they told you everything you needed to know,"" said one senior banker, who declined to be named. ####  ##### While he is credited with transforming Deutsche Bank into an investment banking powerhouse during a decade-long tenure, Mr. Ackermann is no stranger to controversy. ####  ##### Last month, he lost a power battle at Siemens A.G., where he is a nonexecutive director, over the ousting of Chief Executive Peter Loescher, and he faces the prospect of being dragged into a legal row over Deutsche's role in the collapse of the Kirch media empire over a decade ago. #### "

Wauthier, 53, and Ackermann, 65, over how to explain the company's recent financial results. ####  ##### Mr. Walsh said the company needs to provide a more complete explanation. ####  ##### “You cannot speak to what motivated the CFO, but you have to talk about what prompted your chairman to resign,” Mr. Walsh said. “What the family thinks of his role doesn't go away just because he walks out the door.” ####  ##### Yet, during the conference call, Zurich CEO Martin Senn sought to push back on the perceived connection between the suicide and the insurer's business and financial performance. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In August, Zurich reported a 27% drop in first-half net income after incurring heavy natural catastrophe-related losses due to severe flooding in Europe and tornadoes in North America. ####  ##### “While the results were somewhat mixed, we continue to be very profitable and we continue to generate healthy cash flows,” Mr. Senn said during the conference call. “We have a strong and resilient balance sheet.” ####  ##### Nonetheless, Mr. de Swaan said the company would investigate the working relationship between Messrs. Wauthier and Ackermann. ####  ##### “The board sees it as a prime responsibility to look at whether there was undue pressure on our CFO,” he said. ####  ##### Competent short-term crisis management mixed with a clearly articulated strategic vision for the long term is imperative for Zurich to mollify investors and internal stakeholders, said an executive familiar with the company speaking on condition of anonymity. ####  ##### “When bad things happen, leaders have to step to the microphone and say, 'I'm in charge, here's the plan and everything will be OK,'” he said. “This is a situation that necessitates leadership and stability.” ####  ##### Mr. Senn said an ongoing strategic reassessment will be reported during the company's investor day in December. ####  ##### “Our strategy remained unchanged by recent events,” Mr. Senn said. ####  ##### Yet some remain unsure of the company's strategic direction and the board's ability to help senior management chart a course. ####  ##### Andrew Barile, Savannah, Ga.-based CEO of insurance consultancy Andrew Barile Consulting Corp., cited a lack of insurance industry experience among directors on the company's board. ####  ##### “The board is really undermanned when it comes to understanding the insurance industry,” Mr. Barile said. “It's mostly bankers.” #### "
"Military contractor settles whistle-blower charges of improper testing";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A Florida firm has agreed to a settlement with a value of up to $4.4 million to resolve False Claims Act charges filed by whistle-blowers that it improperly tested equipment and electronic parts that are used by the military and NASA, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. ####  ##### Two whistle-blowers, who are former employees of St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Conax Florida Corp., will receive a total of $810,500 as a result of the settlement, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### The department said Conax and related companies improperly tested inertia reels and nonconforming voltage references. Inertia reels are part of a system designed to secure aircrew members in the event of a crash. On impact, they lock in place harnesses worn by aircrew members, preventing injury. Voltage references are electronic parts used in water-activated parachute releases. Both devices are used by the U.S. military and NASA, according to the Justice Department. ####  ##### The government charged the inertia reels were not tested in accordance with contractual requirement and that Conax used nonconforming voltage references. It said the voltage reference is an integral part of the water-activated parachute release, designed to protect unconscious or injured aircrew members who parachute into salt water. They are intended to automatically separate parachutes from aircrew members when they are physically unable to do so. If parachutes are not released, they may fill with water and drag crew members underwater. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement, Conax paid $2 million to the government. It also reached an agreement with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to provide the government with 4,969 new electronic parts for use with parachute releases, which are worth up to $2.4 million. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The whistle-blowers in the case, who had filed suit under the whistle-blower provision of the False Claims Act in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, are Mark Hansson and Steven Schummer. ####  ##### Stuart F. Delery, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, said in a statement, “Our military deserves equipment that is properly built and tested and meets specifications designed to ensure their safety.” ####  ##### Conax's parent company, Arlington, Va.-based Cobham P.L.C., said in a statement: “During the course of the government's investigation — which lasted more than four years — evidence was provided which resulted in the government declining to bring criminal charges. ####  ##### “The government pursued two of the many allegations in the complaint, with the company choosing to settle the civil false claims allegations for a minimal sum relative to the value of the contracts at issue. ####  ##### “Throughout the course of the investigation, the company maintained that its products posed no safety concerns, a position supported by the government's technical experts after thorough testing.” #### "
"Radiation oncology providers to settle whistle-blower suit for $3.5M";"Risk Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Inter-related radiation oncology providers in Pensacola, Fla., will pay $3.5 million to the federal government and the state of Florida to settle charges in a whistle-blower suit that says they billed government programs, including Medicare, for radiation oncology services that were ineligible for payment. ####  ##### Most of the defendants say they have always provided appropriate health care. ####  ##### A whistle-blower will receive about $609,800 from the federal government's share of the settlement amount, according to the Department of Justice. ####  ##### The defendants, which included Sacred Heart Health System Inc. and West Florida Medical Center Clinic P.A., were charged, between 2007 and 2011, with regularly billing for radiation oncology services that were not supervised by a physician as required by Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE, which is the health care program for uniformed service members, retirees and their families, the DOJ said Friday. ####  ##### The DOJ said, in fact, these services often were performed while the defendant doctors were on vacation or working at another radiation oncology clinic. The government also charged that the defendants billed for other treatment services even when patients' medical records provided no evidence the services were rendered. ####  ##### They also allegedly billed twice for the same services and misrepresented the level of service provided to increase their reimbursement from the federal health care programs. ####  ##### According to the DOJ, Sacred Heart and West Florida Medical Center have been the sole shareholders of defendants Gulf Regional Radiology Oncology MSO L.L.C. and Gulf Region Radiation Oncology Centers Inc. since December 2007. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Sacred Heart was also a shareholder in Emerald Coast Radiation Oncology Center L.L.C. in Destin, Fla., which is about 60 miles from Pensacola. Also, beginning in December 2007, defendants Drs. Gerald Lowrey and Rod Krentel, who are both radiation oncologists, began providing physician services at Gulf Region Radiation clinics, and in June 2008, and began providing services at Emerald Coast Radiation. ####  ##### In addition to the overall settlement, Gulf Region Radiation and Drs. Lowrey and Krentel entered into integrity agreements with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General that are intended to deter wrongful conduct in the future, and require enhanced accountability and monitoring activities to be conducted by internal and independent reviewers, the DOJ said in its statement. ####  ##### The charges resolved by the settlement were first raised in a lawsuit filed against the defendants under the whistle-blower provisions of the False Claims Act. Whistle-blower Richard Koch, who previously worked at Gulf Region Radiation, will receive about $609,796 from the federal share of the settlement amount, said the DOJ. ####  ##### According to the settlement, which was filed in federal district court in Pensacola, there has still not been a settlement agreement as to a retaliation claim by Mr. Koch, as well as his attorneys' fees and expenses, and these remain pending. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Commenting on the settlement, Pamela C. Marsh, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee said in a statement, “Submitting false claims for medical services raises the cost of health care for all of us as patients and taxpayers. Patients, employees and others who suspect billing fraud on the part of health care providers should not hesitate to report such fraud to federal authorities. Health care providers – both corporations and individuals – must be held accountable when they submit false information.” ####  ##### Defendants other than the physicians said in a joint statement, “The settlement is not an admission of liability by (Gulf Regional Radiation), its owners, or the radiation oncologists. ####  ##### “We have disputed the lawsuit for the past 17 months and we are pleased to settle the matter and avoid further protracted litigation and substantial legal costs.” ####  ##### The statement said, “The defendants have consistently maintained that all of the care provided by the physicians and facilities was always safe, medically necessary and appropriate. ####  ##### “It is important to note that the lawsuit had nothing to do with the health care provided by Sacred Heart Hospital, Medical Center Clinic or the physicians of Sacred Heart Medical Oncology Group. The allegations involved the (Gulf Regional Radiation) facilities which are separate and jointly owned by Sacred Heart Health System and Medical Center Clinic.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The attorney for Dr. Lowrey, Brian E. Dickerson, a partner with law firm Roetzel & Andress P.A. in Washington, said: “The larger companies in this case felt it was more economical to settle this case than to fight it. There's no question of wrongdoing. The question at hand has nothing to do with standards of care and the quality of care provided to patients. ####  ##### “The issue is what (has been deemed) necessary to bill vs. what many of the medical professional associations deem necessary to review, and this ambiguity is causing this type of litigation and False Claim Act cases across the country,” Mr. Dickerson said. ####  ##### The attorney for Dr. Krentel could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Medical identity theft a growing problem: Survey";"Risk Management";"Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits";" ##### Medical identity theft is a growing problem, but many of the victims know the thief and do not want to report him or her, says a survey released Thursday. ####  ##### The number of victims affected by medical identity theft increased by an estimated 19% over the past year, to 313,000 new victims, and generated more than an estimated $12.3 billion in out-of-pocket expenses in 2013, according to the 2013 Survey on Medical Theft, which also reflected data from government agencies. ####  ##### The survey was conducted by the Traverse City, Mich.-based Ponemon Institute and sponsored by the newly formed Washington-based Medical Identity Fraud Alliance with support from Portland, Ore.-based data breach prevention and response specialist firm ID Experts. ####  ##### For purposes of the study, medical theft occurs when someone uses an individual's name and personal identity to fraudulently receive medical services, goods and/or prescription drugs, including efforts to commit fraudulent billing. ####  ##### According to the survey of 788 adults who self-reported that they or close family members were victims of medical identity theft, the crime happened 30% of the time because the victims knowingly shared their personal identification or medical credential with someone they knew, and 28% of the time because a family member took their personal identification or medical credentials without consent. ####  ##### The survey found that 50% of the respondents were unaware that medical identity theft can create inaccuracies in their permanent medical records. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Of those who tried to resolve the incident, 35% said they worked with their health plan and/or insurer, and 31% with their health care provider. This took almost or year more, according to 36% of the respondents, and 48% said the crime is still not resolved. ####  ##### Robin Slade, development coordinator for the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance, said she hopes employers will help their employees understand the steps they can take to reduce their exposure to fraud, including talking to them about reviewing their insurers’ explanation of benefits “and why they should protect their medical insurance cards and safeguard their insurance-related paperwork, and what to do if it’s lost or stolen.” ####  ##### Ponemon Institute Chairman Larry Ponemon said, “It’s not in the employer’s interest to have fraud of any kind,” so clearly firms can educate their workers on this issue. Employers can also work with companies that are developing stronger identification credentials, such as identification cards that contain microchips, so there is a more effective authentication process, Mr. Ponemon said. This must be done in conjunction with the health care insurer, he said. ####  ##### Copies of the survey are available  here. ####  ##### Ms. Slade said the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance is a public-private partnership that includes health plans, health providers, technology firms and other service providers and is intended to address the issue of medical fraud. #### "
"BP faces pressure over Algeria gas plant attack";"Risk Management";"Terrorism, Energy, Political Risk";" ##### (Reuters) — Some foreign workers at an Algerian desert gas plant feared for their safety well before Islamist militants killed dozens at the site, and relatives and survivors want joint operator BP P.L.C. to investigate its own security record. ####  ##### Forty oil workers, all but one foreign, died at In Amenas, Algeria, in January after the militants took expatriates hostage during a four-day siege that ended when Algerian forces stormed the site. ####  ##### BP and Norway's Statoil ASA, partners in the joint venture with Algerian state energy firm Sonatrach, have said it was impossible to predict an attack of such unprecedented scale. ####  ##### However, the widow of one British victim said her husband had expressed worry in an email sent about seven weeks before the surprise raid on Jan. 16 that a labor dispute at the plant had undermined security and could lead to serious violence. ####  ##### Contractor Garry Barlow was evacuated when tensions rose during the strike at In Amenas. According to his widow, Lorraine, he returned after his managers at the joint venture assured him it was now safe, but died within weeks on his 50th birthday during the siege in which four BP staff were also killed. ####  ##### A lawyer representing mostly British survivors and families of the victims has also said his clients wanted answers from BP over possible security failings, and said some were considering suing the company for negligence and breach of duty of care. ####  ##### None has yet sued. In an emailed response to Reuters questions, BP said: ""We can't comment on speculative legal action. However, BP will vigorously defend any such actions."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### BP has already set aside $42 billion for cleanup costs, fines and compensation for a blast and oil spill at a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. A trial of BP over the disaster three years ago is due to resume in the United States on Monday. ####  ##### Any compensation claims linked to In Amenas would be much smaller, but could further hurt BP's reputation if successful. ####  ##### London-listed BP said it had been unaware of any specific threat to the In Amenas project, or to British or Western interests in the area before the attack. ####  ##### While Statoil has already conducted and published its own inquiry, BP said it did not plan to follow suit. ""Because of the nature of the incident and the fact that the response was an Algerian military operation, there are many questions arising which BP is not in a position to answer,"" BP spokesman Robert Wine said in the email. ####  ##### British police were investigating the deaths of UK citizens on behalf of a coroner who will hold an inquest, he noted, adding that BP would cooperate with the coroner and review the outcome of official investigations for lessons to be learned. ####  ##### Widow Lorraine Barlow questioned BP's security procedures and decision-making before her husband Garry's death, calling on the group to follow the example of Statoil, which published the report on its high-level investigation on Sept. 12. ####  ##### Barlow told Reuters that Garry, who as a contractor was not directly employed by BP, had become worried about his safety last year when tensions rose over the industrial dispute with local drivers, who had begun to bring their relatives on site. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### His fears were laid out in the email to his sister on Nov. 30 after many expatriates had already been evacuated or ""demobbed"" in the industry jargon. ####  ##### ""Situation is getting dodgy here, local drivers have been on strike for 6 months, they are now on hunger strike, place is practically crippled and can't go on much longer,"" he wrote in an email tinged with black humor that British lawmaker Rosie Cooper read out in parliament on June 12. ####  ##### ""Local Tuareg have said that if any of the hunger strikers die then they will kill 30 expats at the In Amenas gas plant. As most expats have been demobbed, there are only 10 of us left, they must be planning to kill us all three times over, ha ha."" ####  ##### The Tuareg community are traditionally nomadic people who inhabit the Sahara desert mainly in Algeria, Mali and Niger. ####  ##### According to Statoil's report, written by staff and external security experts including a former acting director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the long-running dispute over contracts worsened in November when the hunger strike began. ####  ##### The drivers went back to work in return for a pay rise and contract extension the next month, but the report said joint venture managers had felt the deal was unlikely to last. ####  ##### Ms. Barlow said her husband was evacuated in early December 2012 and had not expected to go back as the situation was so tense. Garry had begun to look for other work when his managers told him the strike was over and it was safe to return, she said. ####  ##### ""He took their word for it,"" she told Reuters. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Garry was hired and paid through IOTA Group, a Swiss company that provides human resources services to the oil sector, but his widow said he worked for and was managed by the joint venture. ####  ##### BP said it was not previously aware of the email and there was no evidence the joint venture or shareholders were. ""There is no evidence that BP is aware of, that the drivers' strike had any connection to the incident,"" said Mr. Wine, the BP spokesman. ####  ##### The attackers were not from inside the facility but from the ranks of hardline guerrillas who have been waging jihad across much of the Sahara, and Algeria says they arrived at In Amenas from over the nearby border with Libya. ####  ##### However, locally hired workers who escaped the siege told Reuters at the time that the gunmen moved around the sprawling plant confidently, apparently familiar with its layout, raising questions about whether they had inside help. ####  ##### Algerian authorities have since arrested a man who had been employed at In Amenas and provided the militants with insider information, Algerian security sources said. ####  ##### Statoil's inquiry found security at the plant was inadequately managed, and a Norwegian union has said the firm's chief executive, Helge Lund, should consider resigning. Mr. Lund has said he did not plan to quit. ####  ##### Ms. Barlow, who will be represented by U.K. law firm Slater & Gordon at the inquest, said she did not intend to sue BP for compensation. However, she wanted to know the truth about how Garry was killed and whether more could have been done to protect workers at In Amenas. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""We need to know who made the decision to send them back, how that decision was made, what criteria were used to make that decision,"" she said. ""I know they could never have stopped the terrorists from coming, but was there anything that could have been in place that would have minimized what happened?"" ####  ##### The Statoil inquiry concluded that while the joint venture partners could not have prevented the attack, the Norwegian company, at least, was aware of the growing risks. ####  ##### It showed Statoil was concerned enough to order a risk consultancy report, delivered in July 2012, which suggested Algerian security forces were increasingly stretched and their ability to manage threats should be closely monitored. ####  ##### ""Regional political and security dynamics give rise to the credible threat of a one-off, high-impact terrorist incident in the oil-producing provinces,"" it quoted that report as saying. ####  ##### Michael Doherty, a quality control technician who survived the siege, said in a documentary by Britain's Channel 4 television that he had also been worried about security. ####  ##### ""I couldn't believe how inadequate that system was compared to other sites that I've worked in the world,"" he said. ""We were looked upon as a very vulnerable and easy target."" Reuters was not able to reach Mr. Doherty for comment. ####  ##### Controversy has also arisen over who was responsible for the safety of contractors like Mr. Barlow, who were not BP or Statoil staff but were hired through recruitment or other firms. ####  ##### In Amenas gas plant usually employs around 700 people, mostly Algerians. At the time of the siege, BP had about 20 people at the facility while Statoil had 17. There were also dozens of foreign contractors on the site. Six British nationals and a British resident were among those killed. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Trevor Sterling, a lawyer for Slater & Gordon, which is representing 37 people, both survivors and relatives of the dead, said British workers had felt reassured by BP's involvement in the project. ""Our clients would not have gone to work for Sonatrach. It was because it was BP. They felt safe because it was BP,"" he said. ####  ##### BP had not met contractors who survived or the families of contractors who died to try to build up a broader picture of what happened and avoid a repeat, he added. ####  ##### Mr. Wine said BP had debriefed its staff but contractors were employed through the joint venture, which is a separate entity. ####  ##### While BP said it would cooperate with the coroner, the inquest has yet to be held more than six months after the attack. At a preliminary hearing in July, coroner Penelope Schofield found there was insufficient information to set the scope of the inquest. ####  ##### The complexity of the case, involving a major incident on foreign soil and firms based in Algeria and Norway as well as the U.K. meant it had taken time for British police to gather information, the coroner's officer said. ####  ##### Another preliminary hearing is set for November and the inquest is likely to be held next year, he said. ####  ##### Even if the coroner sets the widest possible remit for the inquiry, as Ms. Barlow hopes she will, the inquest will not point a finger, although Slater & Gordon says it may provide more information and potentially offer grounds for legal action. ####  ##### ""The coroner must answer four questions: who died and where, when and how they met their death,"" said Geoff Charnock, officer at West Sussex coroner's service. ""This is not a court of blame."" #### "
"Two companies settle harassment, discrimination cases with EEOC";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Birmingham, Ala., has reached settlements with two companies, one involving a class sexual harassment case and the other involving a disability discrimination lawsuit. ####  ##### The agency said Thursday that it has reached a $215,000 settlement with Winston-Salem, N.C.-based WilcoHess L.L.C. in a case in which it charged that a district manager had engaged in sexually inappropriate and harassing conduct involving several of female employees at a company-operated Wendy's restaurant and Travel Plaza store in Tuscaloosa, Ala. ####  ##### Despite some of the women complaining about the harassment to other managers, nothing was done to discipline or otherwise prevent the manager from continuing to harass his employees for several years, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The company was accused of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement with the company, which operates more than 400 travel plazas and convenience stores throughout the United States, the company will pay $215,000 to any past or present employees the EEOC determines suffered damage. ####  ##### The four-year consent decree settling the suit also includes a requirement that the company put several measures in place to prevent similar behavior from happening again. ####  ##### “Sexual harassment is not just bad for workplace morale, it is also a serious violation of federal law. Tolerating lewd or harassing behavior is not a job requirement and employers must provide a meaningful mechanism for employees to report such misconduct,” Delner Franklin-Thomas, district director of the EEOC's Birmingham, Ala., district office, said in a statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The company has denied the charges in the matter, according to the order filed in federal court in Tuscaloosa. ####  ##### WilcoHess attorney Kenneth P. Carlson Jr., a partner with law firm Constangy Brooks & Smith L.L.P. in Winston-Salem, said in a statement, “This was a settlement in which there was no liability admitted, and in which the purported ""class"" originally alleged by the EEOC was essentially cut in half by the court after an appropriate motion by WilcoHess. The company had proper policies in place, appropriately investigated the harassment allegations after a single anonymous complaint was faxed to the company's North Carolina headquarters, and took prompt remedial action. In other words, WilcoHess did what our laws require to help ensure a harassment-free workplace. The case was resolved strictly to avoid the time and expense of continued litigation."" ####  ##### Separately, an Alabama construction company that was accused of refusing to provide a ramp to a worker recovering from a leg fracture, and then firing her, has reached a $125,000 settlement with the EEOC. ####  ##### The agency said Thursday that Patricia Pittman, a former employee of Montgomery, Ala.-based Caddell Construction Co., had suffered a leg fracture that required surgery while working at Caddell's Eglin Air Force Base facility in Florida. ####  ##### After the surgery, the company refused her request for a wheelchair ramp to enter the office and to be allowed to use her crutches and a walker, and fired her days after her accommodation request, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The company was accused of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### Under the settlement agreement, in addition to paying Ms. Pittman the $125,000, Caddell agreed to provide training to its employees on its obligations under the ADA, among other measures. ####  ##### Caddell, which has denied the charges, said it terminated Ms. Pittman because her physical impairments prevented her from performing the essential functions of her job, according to the consent decree filed in federal court in Pensacola, Fla. ####  ##### A company spokesman could not be reached for comment. #### "
"Same-sex harassment case involving gender stereotyping can proceed";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A plaintiff can successfully pursue a same-sex harassment case where gender stereotyping is involved, even when neither the alleged harasser nor victim is homosexual, said a divided en banc appellate court in reversing a ruling by an appellate panel. ####  ##### Kerry Woods, a male construction worker for New Orleans-based Boh Brothers Construction Co. L.L.C. who was assigned to the maintenance crew for the Twin Spans bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., claimed that crew superintendent Charles Wolfe engaged in same-sex harassment against him, including by simulating anal intercourse with him and using foul language, according to Friday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Boh Brothers Construction Co. L.L.C. ####  ##### The alleged harassment was provoked by Mr. Woods' use of wet wipes instead of toilet paper, which Mr. Wolfe views as “kind of gay” and “feminine,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### After Mr. Woods complained about Mr. Wolfe's harassment to a supervisor in November 2006, Mr. Woods was sent home for three days without pay for reasons that are unclear, and upon his return was hired at a different Boh Brothers site. ####  ##### After he was laid off for lack of work in February 2007, Mr. Woods filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because of his removal from his original job. ####  ##### A U.S. District Court jury in New Orleans issued a verdict in Boh Brothers' favor on the retaliation claim, but on the sexual harassment claim awarded Mr. Woods $201,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages, with the former reduced to $50,000 because of a statutory damages cap. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Boh Brothers appealed. ####  ##### A unanimous three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit vacated the award. But the en banc court disagreed with the panel in a 10-6 ruling. ####  ##### In its ruling, the appellate court cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1989 Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins decision in which the high court held that a plaintiff can rely on gender-stereotyping evidence to show that discrimination occurred; and the Supreme Court’s 1998 ruling in Oncale v. Sundowner, in which it held that discrimination charges can be made when the plaintiff and defendant are of the same sex. ####  ##### “In sum, nothing in Oncale overturns or otherwise upsets the court’s holding in Price Waterhouse: a plaintiff may establish a sexual harassment claim with evidence of sex-stereotyping. Thus, the EEOC may rely on evidence that Wolfe viewed Woods as insufficiently masculine to prove its Title VII claim.” ####  ##### “There is enough evidence to support the jury’s conclusion that Wolfe harassed Woods because of sex,” said the majority ruling. “Specifically, the EEOC offered evidence that Wolfe, the crew superintendent, thought that Woods was not a manly enough man and taunted him tirelessly.” ####  ##### The court also held the harassment was severe and pervasive as a matter of law. “Wolfe hurled raw sex-based epithets uniquely at Woods two to three times a day,” said the court, in upholding the Title VII claim. ####  ##### It upheld dismissal of the punitive damages award, however, holding that Boh Brothers “did not subjectively perceive a risk of violation of federal law.” ####  ##### The case was remanded to the District Court to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s $201,000 compensatory damages award. #### "

"Railroad in Quebec explosion can operate until Feb. 1";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### The railroad involved in July's deadly derailment and explosion of a runaway train in Quebec has had a significant decline in the volume of commodities it transports, including the volume of dangerous goods, said a Canadian regulator Wednesday in extending its permit to continue operations until Feb. 1, 2014. ####  ##### The Ottawa, Ontario-based Canadian Transportation Agency in September said it had received a request from Hermon, Maine-based Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd., which was involved in the derailment that killed 46 people and destroyed much of central Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, to maintain its certificate of fitness until Jan. 15, 2014. ####  ##### Following this request, the railroad asked for an extension until Jan. 31, 2014. The agency said it has now decided there is adequate third-party liability insurance coverage, including self-insurance, for the proposed railway operations until Feb. 1, 2014. ####  ##### According to the decision, the railroad continues to have a self-insured retention of $250,000 in its liability insurance policy in addition to $25 million of third-party liability insurance coverage for any one occurrence and in the aggregate. ####  ##### The insurer is XL Insurance Co. Ltd., according to Robert J. Keach, a shareholder with law firm Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer & Nelson P.A. in Portland, Maine, who has been named the railroad's trustee. ####  ##### The agency also said during its review of proposed longer-term operations that it found “a significant decline” in the value of commodities transported by the railroad, including the volume of dangerous goods. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “This equates to a forecasted decrease of over 70% of total traffic with a reduction in the transport of dangerous goods of over 80%,” it said in its order. ####  ##### The order also said the volume of dangerous goods is expected to decline to 30% of its total traffic, from the preaccident level of 50%. ####  ##### The agency said the railroad has reduced the distance over which dangerous goods are carried by 90% by no longer transporting crude oil, “which also reduces the overall risk exposure. The greatly reduced volumes combined with much shorter distances over which dangerous goods are carried results in a significant reduction in (the railroad's) risk exposure,” said the decision. ####  ##### “We are very pleased by the extension and are encouraged that this provides our shippers the security and confidence in the railroad that they deserve,” Mr. Keach said in a statement. #### "
"Court justified in allowing similar prior suits as evidence in bias case";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A federal district court was justified in permitting evidence that a plaintiff in a racial harassment action had twice filed similar lawsuits against another employer, said a federal appellate court in a ruling. ####  ##### Rita Brown had filed a racial harassment action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Jabez Sport Clips La., L.L.C. in Houma, La., according to Friday’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Rita Brown v. Jabez Sport Clips La. L.L.C. ####  ##### At trial in September 2010, the court permitted the jury to learn that Ms. Brown had twice filed racial discrimination suits against another hair salon employer. A unanimous jury found Sports Clip employees did not harass the plaintiff, and the court entered judgment in the firm’s favor. ####  ##### Ms. Brown filed an appeal seeking a new trial on the basis that this evidence should have been excluded. In a January 2013 ruling, the federal district court in New Orleans denied the motion, and held that presenting that information was justified. ####  ##### A three-judge appellate panel unanimously agreed with the lower court. “The district court concluded that the probative value of the evidence of the ‘remarkably similar’ prior suits, together with evidence of potentially fraudulent activity associated therewith, substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice,” said the appellate panel. ####  ##### “We need not decide whether the district court erred in admitting the evidence because even if the court erred, the error was harmless. There was substantial other evidence weighing against Brown’s credibility and in favor of the jury’s verdict for the Sports Clips,” said the appellate court in affirming the district court’s ruling. #### "
"Chevron goes to trial in New York over $18B Ecuador award";"Risk Management";"Energy";" ##### (Reuters) — Chevron Corp. will try to convince a U.S. judge this week that a group of Ecuadorean villagers and their U.S. lawyer used bribery to win an $18 billion judgment against Chevron from a court in Ecuador, in the latest chapter in a long-running fight over pollution in the Amazon jungle. ####  ##### In a trial starting Tuesday, the oil company is asking a federal court in New York to prevent the villagers and their Harvard-educated lawyer, Steven Donziger, from using U.S. courts to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment. ####  ##### A victory in the United States would likely help Chevron's defense in other countries where Mr. Donziger and the villagers may seek to enforce the judgment. ####  ##### ""We believe that any jurisdiction that observes the rule of law will find that the judgment is illegal and unenforceable because it's a product of fraud,"" said Morgan Crinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron. ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the villagers say they did nothing wrong in obtaining the judgment, and they accuse the judge in the U.S. case, District Judge Lewis Kaplan, of bias against them. ####  ##### ""These claims by Chevron are utterly baseless,"" said Chris Gowen, a spokesman for Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans. ####  ##### The trial is the latest chapter in a dispute over environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field in northeastern Ecuador operated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001. ####  ##### Chevron says Texaco cleaned up its share of waste before turning the field over to state-owned Petroecuador. But in 2011, an Ecuadorean court awarded $18 billion to people from the village of Lago Agrio, which was affected by the pollution. The court subsequently increased the award to $19 billion to cover fees. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans have been unable to collect the award in Ecuador because Chevron no longer has operations there. ####  ##### In 2011, Chevron obtained an injunction from Judge Kaplan in New York blocking enforcement of the judgment anywhere outside Ecuador. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that ruling. ####  ##### In the lawsuit, Chevron accuses Mr. Donziger of violating the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and says both he and the villagers committed fraud. ####  ##### Central to Chevron's case is the evidence of a former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra. Judge Guerra said in a sworn deposition that he often wrote opinions for Judge Nicolas Zambrano, who issued the award to the villagers. ####  ##### Judge Guerra said Mr. Donziger and another lawyer pledged to pay Judge Zambrano $500,000 from whatever they collected from the judgment in exchange for allowing them to write it. Judge Guerra also said Judge Zambrano promised to share part of the bribe. ####  ##### Ted Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron, said the proceedings in Ecuador were ""one of the most egregious litigation frauds in history."" ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans say Judge Guerra has no credibility and say he is being paid for his testimony by Chevron. Mr. Donziger denies writing the judgment. ####  ##### ""We are completely and utterly denying the allegations by Chevron,"" his spokesman Mr. Gowen told reporters on Friday. ####  ##### ""Steven Donziger did not ghostwrite a judgment,"" Mr. Gowen said. ""Steven Donziger did not bribe a judge."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In January, Chevron said it relocated Judge Guerra's family to protect his safety and paid him $38,000 for the costs of providing his evidence. Chevron also confirmed that it agreed to pay Judge Guerra's family $10,000 per month for living expenses and $2,000 for housing. ####  ##### Judges Guerra and Zambrano are expected to testify at the trial, which is expected to last several weeks. ####  ##### Mr. Donziger and the Ecuadoreans argue that the relief Chevron seeks — a ban on enforcing the Ecuadorean judgment in U.S. courts or profiting from it in any way — would violate the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' reversal of Judge Kaplan's 2011 injunction. ####  ##### They also say they are fighting an unfair battle. Chevron has overwhelmingly more resources. And Mr. Donziger and the villagers accuse Judge Kaplan of bias. In a court filing, they wrote that Judge Kaplan's ""contempt"" for Ecuador, ""its courts, and its laws has only grown more prominent over time."" ####  ##### The 2nd Circuit on Sept. 26 rejected their request to remove Judge Kaplan from the case. ####  ##### Earlier this month, Judge Kaplan ruled that the villagers and Mr. Donziger are not entitled to a trial by jury, as they had preferred, because Chevron waived damages claims against them. #### "

Moreover, the alleged copyright violator has not responded to repeated requests by Big Ticket and YouTube to remove the offending video. ####  ##### The suit seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Mr. De Los Angeles from committing further infringement of the copyright, unspecified damages for willful infringement, as well as attorneys’ fees and court costs. #### "

"Swiss oilfield firm pays $250M to settle Foreign Corrupt Practices Act charges";"Risk Management";"Regulation, Risk Management, Switzerland";" ##### A Swiss-based oilfield services company has agreed to pay $250 million to settle Foreign Corrupt Practices Act charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. ####  ##### The regulators alleged that Zug, Switzerland-based Weatherford International and its subsidiaries authorized bribes and improper travel and entertainment for foreign officials in the Middle East and Africa to win business, including kickbacks in Iraq to obtain United Nations Oil-for Food-contracts. ####  ##### The SEC said Tuesday announcing the settlement that Weatherford and its subsidiaries falsified its books and records to conceal illicit payments as well as transactions with Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan that violated U.S. sanctions and export control laws. ####  ##### The SEC charged that the company failed to establish an effective system of internal accounting controls to monitor risks of improper payments and prevent or detect misconduct. ####  ##### Weatherford earned more than $59.3 million in profits from business obtained through improper payments, and more than $30 million in profits from its improper sales to sanctioned countries, the SEC said. The alleged misconduct occurred from at least 2002 to 2011. ####  ##### %%break%% ####  ##### The settlement agreement settles the SEC's charges and parallel actions by the U.S. Department of Justice's fraud section, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ####  ##### “The nonexistence of internal controls at Weatherford fostered an environment where employees across the globe engaged in bribery and failed to maintain accurate books and records,” said Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, in a statement. “They used code names like 'Dubai across the water' to conceal references to Iran in internal correspondence, placed key transaction documents in mislabeled binders, and created whatever bogus accounting and inventory records were necessary to hide illegal transactions.” ####  ##### A company spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Taser liability in teen's death affirmed, but damages get new trial";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court ruling on Taser International Inc.'s liability in the death of a teenager, but remanded the case for a new trial on the $5.5 million in damages awarded in the case. ####  ##### An incident involving 17-year-old Darryl Wayne Turner taking a bottle of water from the supermarket where he worked without paying for it kicked off an escalating series of confrontations with store management that ultimately led to his death after he was shot in the heart with a Taser by a Charlotte, N.C., police officer, according to Friday's ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in Tammy Lou Fontenot as administratrix of the estate of Darryl Wayne Turner and Devoid Turner v. Taser International Inc. ####  ##### Mr. Turner's mother filed a product liability lawsuit against Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser, alleging the company negligently failed to warn users of the risks posed by the X26 Taser used in the incident and, in particular, to warn them to avoid applying the electrical current near a subject's heart, which was the case with her son. She also alleged that the company's negligence resulted in her son's death. ####  ##### A federal jury in Charlotte, N.C., found in her favor and awarded her $10 million in compensatory damages, which the court lowered to $6.15 million. After reducing the award to account for funds Ms. Fontenot had received from a workers compensation award and a settlement with the City of Charlotte, the court awarded $5.5 million. ####  ##### Taser appealed. ####  ##### In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court panel affirmed the lower court's judgment upholding the jury verdict that imposed liability on the company for its negligence. ####  ##### It said the X26 Taser used in the incident “had been the subject of several academic studies. (Taser International) knew about these studies, in which researchers had concluded that the device posed a risk of ventricular fibrillation, a cause of cardiac arrest, especially when the electrical current from the Taser was applied near the subject's heart. Nevertheless, (Taser International) failed to warn Taser users to avoid deploying the Taser's electrical current in proximity to the heart.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In holding there should be a new trial on damages, the appeals court said, “We have no doubt that Turner had significant value to his parents, and that they are entitled to a substantial award for the loss of his services, care, and companionship. ####  ##### “However, we cannot agree that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Fontenot, met the required 'reasonable level of certainty' to establish that such services, care and compensation had a monetary value approaching $6.15 million.” ####  ##### The district court “abused its discretion,” the appeals court said in remanding the case for a new trial on damages. ####  ##### In a separate ruling in 2012, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that based on the information available at the time, Taser International could not be held liable for not issuing warnings that repeated exposure to its product could lead to death, in upholding dismissal of a 2004 wrongful death lawsuit. #### "

"JPMorgan warns 465,000 card users on data loss after cyber attack";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. is warning some 465,000 holders of prepaid cash cards issued by the bank that their personal information may have been accessed by hackers who attacked its network in July. ####  ##### The cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment compensation and other benefits. ####  ##### JPMorgan said on Wednesday it had detected that the servers used by its www.ucard.chase.com website had been breached in the middle of September. It then fixed the issue and reported it to law enforcement. ####  ##### Bank spokesman Michael Fusco said that since the breach was discovered, the bank has been trying to find out exactly which accounts were involved and what information may have been compromised. He declined to discuss how the attackers breached the bank's network. ####  ##### Mr. Fusco said the bank was notifying the cardholders, who account for about 2% of its roughly 25 million UCard users, about the breach because it couldn't rule out the possibility that their personal information was among the data removed from its servers. ####  ##### The bank typically keeps the personal information of its customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution. However, during the course of the breach, personal data belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain text in files the computers use to log activity. ####  ##### The bank believes ""a small amount"" of data was taken, but not critical personal information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and email addresses. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity theft. Many states require banks to notify customers if they believe there is any chance that such information may have been taken in a breach. ####  ##### The bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free credit-monitoring services. ####  ##### The warning only affects the bank's UCard users, not holders of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid Liquid cards. ####  ##### Mr. Fusco said the bank had not found that any funds were stolen as a result of the breach and that it had no evidence that other crimes have been committed. As a result, it was not issuing replacement cards. ####  ##### The spokesman declined to identify the government agencies and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach. ####  ##### Officials from the states of Louisiana and Connecticut said the bank notified them this week that personal information of some of their citizens may have been exposed. ####  ##### Louisiana citizens included about 6,000 people who received cards with state income tax refunds, plus 5,300 receiving child support payments and 2,200 receiving unemployment benefits, according to a statement from state Commissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols on Wednesday. ####  ##### Ms. Nichols said Louisiana would ""hold JP Morgan Chase responsible"" for protecting the rights and personal privacy of the citizens. ####  ##### Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier said she was ""dismayed"" that the bank took two and a half months to notify the state of the problem. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""JPMorgan Chase has some work to do, not only to assure the holders of its debit cards, but also to restore the state's confidence in the company's ability to remain worthy of our continued business,"" Ms. Nappier said in a statement on Thursday. ####  ##### The bank said it didn't know who was behind the attack, though the Secret Service and FBI were investigating the matter. ####  ##### Businesses and government agencies are increasingly using prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks. ####  ##### Yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all kinds have created new risks. In 2007, some 41 million credit and debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner of T.J. Maxx stores, were stolen. ####  ##### In May of this year, U.S. prosecutors said a global cyber crime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from automated teller machines in 27 countries. #### "

All three are out on bail. ####  ##### The pleas pose a challenge to SFO head David Green, who has staked his reputation on the success of high-profile investigations such as the sprawling investigation into the manipulation of benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. ####  ##### U.S. and European authorities have fined 10 banks and brokerages around $6 billion to date and have charged seven men with criminal offences in connection with the rate-rigging scam. Regulators are also now investigating how other benchmarks are set, such as in foreign exchange and swaps markets. ####  ##### Libor rates, designed to reflect the wholesale cost of loans, are used to help to price hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of financial products worldwide, ranging from derivatives to mortgages. ####  ##### Prosecutors allege Mr. Hayes conspired to defraud with staff of UBS, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Scotland, ICAP, Tullet Prebon, at least one employee of Deutsche Bank A.G., Rabobank and HSBC Holdings P.L.C., Messrs. Farr and Gilmour and another employee of RP Martin while he worked in Japan. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""They dishonestly agreed to procure or make submissions of rates ... which were false or misleading in that they were intended to create an advantage to the trading position of Tom Hayes and others and deliberately disregarded the proper basis for the submission of those rates, thereby intending to prejudice the economic interests of others,"" the indictment alleges. ####  ##### Judge Jeremy Cooke set a trial date for Mr. Hayes for January 2015.

Farr and Gilmour, which is expected to take around six weeks, has been set for September 2015, in part to allow the SFO time to bring a case against further alleged co-conspirators. ####  ##### Mr. Green had been hoping to charge more individuals in connection with the Libor investigation around this autumn. ####  ##### UBS, which paid $1.5 billion to U.S. and European regulators last year to settle Libor-rigging charges — the biggest Libor-related fine to date — declined to comment, as did Citigroup and ICAP. ####  ##### RP Martin, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and JPMorgan also declined to comment. Tullett Prebon and HSBC did not immediately respond to requests for a comment. ####  ##### Mr. Hayes joined Swiss bank UBS in Tokyo in 2006, becoming a senior trader of interest-rate derivatives indexed to yen-denominated Libor. In late 2009, he left UBS to join Citigroup in Tokyo. He left the U.S. bank less than a year later. ####  ##### While Mr. Hayes was at UBS, Messrs. Farr and Gilmour are alleged to have conspired with him and other UBS employees, another RP Martin employee, an employee of Rabobank and one at HSBC, among others, by trying to influence yen-denominated Libor. ####  ##### Mr. Farr is also charged with conspiring with Mr. Hayes and others while Mr. Hayes worked at Citibank. #### "

"Researchers uncover cyber spying campaign dubbed 'The Mask'";"Risk Management";"Spain, France, Latin America, Russia, United Kingdom, Brazil";" ##### (Reuters) — A computer security software firm has uncovered what it calls the first cyber espionage campaign believed to be started by a Spanish-speaking country, targeting government agencies, energy companies and activists in 31 countries. ####  ##### Dubbed ""The Mask,"" the campaign had operated undetected since 2007 and infected more than 380 targets before it stopped last week, Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab said on Monday. ####  ##### The firm declined to identify the government suspected to be behind the cyber spying, but said it had been most active in Morocco, followed by Brazil, the United Kingdom, France and Spain. ####  ##### The suspected involvement of a Spanish-speaking nation is unusual as the most sophisticated cyber spying operations uncovered so far have been linked to the United States, China, Russia and Israel. Those nations have been said to be behind the Duqu, Gauss and Flame malware, for example. ####  ##### Kaspersky Lab said the discovery of The Mask suggests that more countries have become adept in Internet spying. The firm's researchers only came across the operation because it infected Kaspersky's own software. ####  ##### ""There are many super-advanced groups that we don't know about. This is the tip of the iceberg,"" Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky's global research team, said in an interview on the sidelines of a conference sponsored by his company in the Dominican Republic. ####  ##### Mr. Raiu said The Mask hit government institutions, oil and gas companies and activists using malware that was designed to steal documents, encryption keys and other sensitive files, as well as take full control of infected computers. ####  ##### The operation infected computers running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows and Apple Inc.'s Mac software, and likely mobile devices running Apple's iOS and Google Inc.'s Android software, according to Kaspersky Lab. ####  ##### There was no immediate comment from the companies. ####  ##### Kaspersky Lab said it worked with Apple and other companies last week to shut down some of the websites that were controlling the spying operation. The firm named the operation ""The Mask"" for the translation of the Spanish word ""Careto,"" which appears in the malware code. #### "
"GM more than doubles North American ignition-switch recall";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — General Motors Co. on Tuesday more than doubled a recall, mostly in North America, to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components including airbags to be unintentionally turned off. ####  ##### GM said it is aware of 31 reported incidents, including 13 front-seat fatalities, involving frontal crashes in which the condition may have caused or contributed to the front airbags not deploying. ####  ##### In expanding the recall to 1,620,665 vehicles in the United States, Canada and Mexico and a small number overseas, the No. 1 U.S. automaker also said it would review its recall process. It had previously recalled almost 779,000 cars. ####  ##### ""The process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been,"" GM's North American head, Alan Batey, said in a statement. ""We will take an unflinching look at what happened and apply lessons learned here to improve going forward."" GM said it submitted a detailed chronology associated with the initial recall to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday. ####  ##### All of the crashes occurred off-road and at high speeds, where the probability of serious or fatal injuries was high regardless of airbag deployment, a company spokesman said. Failure to wear seat belts and alcohol use also were factors in some cases, the spokesman said. ####  ##### The Detroit company previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the ""run"" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components. ####  ##### Earlier this month, GM said it was recalling 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 compact cars from model years 2005 through 2007. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On Tuesday, GM added 842,103 Saturn Ion compact cars from 2003 through 2007 model years, Chevy HHR mid-sized vehicles from 2006 and 2007, and the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007. GM no longer makes any of the affected cars. ####  ##### The automaker said it is working with suppliers to increase production of replacement parts and accelerate the process. Batey said GM would work with consumers on a case-by-case basis to minimize inconvenience associated with the recall. ####  ##### Dealers will replace the ignition switch at no charge, but GM advised that until the fix is made, customers should remove nonessential items from their key rings. ####  ##### GM said the ignition switch torque performance may not meet company specifications. The involved parts were made in Mexico, according to documents previously filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ####  ##### Of the new recalled total, 1,367,146 vehicles are in the United States, 235,855 are in Canada, 15,073 are in Mexico and 2,591 were exported outside North America, according to GM. #### "
"Toyota in U.S. settlement over unintended acceleration: Source";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Justice Department has reached a settlement of more than $1 billion with automaker Toyota Motor Corp., stemming from its handling of consumer complaints over unintended vehicle acceleration, a person briefed on the matter said. ####  ##### The settlement could be announced as early as Wednesday, according to the source, who declined to be identified because the agreement was not yet public. ####  ##### The deal, which the source said would include a deferred prosecution agreement, follows a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities. Under the deal, the government agrees to delay or forgo prosecution if a company meets certain conditions. ####  ##### U.S. officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx and Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, were scheduled to announce a ""significant criminal law enforcement action"" at a press conference in Washington at 9:30 a.m. EDT. ####  ##### Toyota faces hundreds of lawsuits over acceleration problems, which gained public attention after the deaths of a California highway patrolman and his family that was reportedly caused by the unintended acceleration of his Lexus, which is made by Toyota. ####  ##### The faulty acceleration prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles, beginning in 2009. ####  ##### Last year Toyota received approval on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve economic loss claims, and is currently negotiating the settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. ####  ##### The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan first subpoenaed Toyota in 2010, seeking documents related to unintended acceleration and financial records. The office later sought documents related to recalls of steering relay rods. ####  ##### Toyota said it was cooperating in the investigation. ####  ##### ""Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years,"" Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said on Wednesday. ""During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."" ####  ##### The FBI, which was also involved in the investigation, is currently probing General Motors Co for failing to disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 12 deaths and that led to a recall last month, a source familiar with the matter said. #### "
"U.S. Tax Court decision on Rent-A-Center deductions buoys captive owners";"Risk Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives";" ##### SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — A U.S. Tax Court decision that allows a federal income tax deduction for premium payments by subsidiaries of Rent-A-Center Inc. to the company's Bermuda captive was not a “game changer” for captive owners. ####  ##### “But it is maybe the first inning of what could become a nine-inning game, and it came out favorably for the taxpayer,” said Thomas M. Jones, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery L.L.P. ####  ##### In Rent-A-Center Inc. v. Commissioner, the Internal Revenue Service argued that the company's captive was a sham entity established to generate federal income tax benefits. But the court found that Rent-A-Center's Bermuda-based Legacy Insurance Co. Ltd. captive is a genuine insurance company providing real risk transfer for the subsidiaries. ####  ##### “It's a little bit frustrating for our clients, because they say 'tell us the new rules,'” Mr. Jones said. But despite the court's Jan. 14 ruling, the advice that he and P. Bruce Wright, a partner at the Sutherland Asbill & Brennan L.L.P., would give clients in similar situations is it all comes down to individual “facts and circumstances,” Mr. Jones said. ####  ##### Their comments came during a session on complex tax issues during the Captive Insurance Cos. Association's 2014 International Conference, held March 9-11 in Scottsdale, Ariz. ####  ##### Even so, it was significant that 15 of the 16 the Tax Court judges decided the case, Mr. Jones said. It also was the first full court review of a captive premium deductibility case involving the so-called “brother-sister theory” since the 1987 Humana Inc. & Subs. v. Commissioner case, Mr. Jones said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In that case, the Tax Court did not allow Louisville, Ky.-based Humana to take a tax deduction for premiums paid to its captive, holding that risks that are either insured or reinsured by a related insurance company cannot be deducted from federal income taxes because the risk was not shifted from the policyholder. But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati overturned the decision in 1989. ####  ##### Mr. Jones said part of the reason the full Tax Court decided to review Rent-A-Center was because the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, not the 6th Circuit, would have decided any appeal. ####  ##### “So the tax court got all the judges together in a room to decide whether they thought that they were actually wrong back in 1987 and that Rent-A-Center should take advantage of brother-sister, or should they stick to their guns and say they were still right, which they could have done and rejected brother-sister,” Mr. Jones said. “Or as one of the dissenting judges I think rather sarcastically said, they could have avoided the whole thing by saying the IRS issued a revenue rule that accepts brother-sister in certain circumstances.” ####  ##### In 2001, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2001-31 that reversed its longstanding position that premiums paid to captives are not deductible under the “economic family” theory. ####  ##### “In any case, they tackled the hard thing. They admitted they were wrong,” Mr. Jones said. ####  ##### But because Rent-A-Center was not a unanimous decision and could easily have gone the other way.” he said. “In other words this is not money in the bank, it's just what we think might be the beginning of a trend. The brother-sister theory is now accepted in Tax Court.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Also during the session, Mr. Wright addressed attempts by the IRS to tax reinsurance transactions multiple times, a process he called “cascading tax.” ####  ##### Under a 2008 IRS revenue ruling, “every time a U.S. risk is transferred from one insurer to another, that is another taxable transaction” subject to federal excise tax, Mr. Wright said. “So for example, if an insurer reinsures with a Bermuda company, it's 4%; if the Bermuda company reinsures with another Bermuda company, it's 1% on the next transaction, and on and on.” ####  ##### In response, Bermuda-based Validus Reinsurance Ltd. filed a refund suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2013 arguing that the excise tax did not apply to retrocessions. In February this year, the court ruled for Validus. ####  ##### “The problem is, they may have won too much because the decision was based on retrocessions,” Mr. Wright said. “Let's assume a U.S. insured insures with an insurance company in the U.S. and that company reinsures with another company in the U.S. and that company reinsures with a Bermuda company. Now, based on the decision in this case, there is no excise tax on that transaction ... because it's a retrocession transaction.” ####  ##### Mr. Wright said he expects the IRS to appeal, and recommended that captive owners pay the excise tax on reinsurance transactions to avoid an IRS audit. ####  ##### The heavily attended session was part of the annual CICA conference that attracted more than 560 attendees and 49 exhibitors. #### "
"Speak CFO's language to get C-suite involved in risk management";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers";" ##### NEW YORK — To engage the corporate leadership of an organization about insurance matters, risk managers must reach the chief financial officer, and to reach the CFO, one must speak the language of finance, according to a prominent insurance scholar. ####  ##### “Sometimes it seems to me that we are all reporting to a chief financial officer,” Jack Hampton, professor of business at St. Peter's University in Jersey City, N.J., and former executive director of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc., said Thursday at the Business Insurance Risk Management Summit in New York. ####  ##### “Does it make a difference if we speak the language of the CFO?” asked Mr. Hampton. Using a set of words tailored to catch the attention of the CFO could be a powerful tool in communicating about insurance needs and topics, he said. ####  ##### “You must teach finance people the total cost of risk,” said Mr. Hampton. ####  ##### He said any communication or presentation about insurance or risk management aimed at the CFO should highlight concepts with which the finance chief is familiar or on which he or she is focused, especially cost savings. ####  ##### “The financial component of the argument will get the CFO's attention,” Mr. Hampton said. “You must answer any questions with a financial foundation.” ####  ##### In fact, Mr. Hampton suggested that the two functions are similar and parallel. “Is it risk management, is it finance, or both?” he said. #### "
"Sick worker's FMLA lawsuit reinstated on appeal";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### An appeals court has reinstated Family Leave and Medical Act interference and retaliation charges filed by a worker who was terminated after he requested leave for his congestive heart failure. ####  ##### Alan Demyanovich, an employee of more than 20 years of Wyandotte, Mich.-based automotive firm Cadon Plating & Coatings L.L.C., had taken FMLA leave for health issues several times over the years, according to Friday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Alan Demyanovich v. Cadon Plating & Coatings L.L.C. et al. ####  ##### In February 2010, he again asked for leave, but his request was denied by the company's vice president because the executive believed the firm did not have the minimum 50 employees needed to have the firm become subject to the act, according to the ruling. Mr. Demyanovich claimed the vice president also told him he was a “liability.” His employment was terminated shortly thereafter. ####  ##### Mr. Demyanovich filed suit against the company, charging it with interfering with his FMLA rights, retaliation under the FMLA and disability discrimination under both federal and state law. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Detroit dismissed all the charges, stating, among other factors, that there was a question as to whether Cadon is covered by the FMLA and that Mr. Demyanovich was not an eligible employee under the act because he could not show he would have been able to work at the end of the 12-week FMLA leave period. ####  ##### The lower court also said Mr. Demyanovich had failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding his FMLA retaliation claim. ####  ##### Mr. Demyanovich appealed the ruling. ####  ##### In reinstating the case, a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit unanimously said that although Cadon had less than 50 employees, it is covered under FMLA because it is an “integrated employer” with Utica, Mich.-based MNP Corp., with whom it shares several common managers. ####  ##### The court also held that “although there is ample evidence that Demyanovich might have had difficulty returning to work” within 12 weeks of his Feb. 23 requested formal leave, “it is not indisputable that he would have been unable to do so.” ####  ##### “Because we find sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Cadon interfered with Demyanovich's right to FMLA leave without a legitimate reason for doing so, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cadon as to the FMLA interference claim,” said the appeals court. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On the retaliation claim, pointing to the vice president's statement that Mr. Demyanovich was a liability immediately after his FMLA leave request, the panel said he has “presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that he was terminated in retaliation for requesting FMLA leave.” ####  ##### The court also held there was sufficient evidence in the record for which a reasonable jury could conclude Cadon had discriminated against Mr. Demyanovich on the basis of his disability in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and Michigan's Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. ####  ##### The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings. #### "
"Britain charges three former ICAP brokers over Libor rigging";"Risk Management";"United Kingdom, Japan";" ##### (Reuters) — British fraud prosecutors began criminal proceedings against three former brokers from ICAP, the world's top interdealer broker, as the U.K. side of a global investigation into alleged rigging of crucial benchmark interest rates cranked up. ####  ##### The Serious Fraud Office said on Friday it was charging former ICAP derivatives broker Darrell Paul Read, his supervisor Daniel Martin Wilkinson and Colin John Goodman, a cash broker in ICAP’s London office, in connection with the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor. ####  ##### They SFO alleged in a statement that the three “conspired to defraud” between Aug. 8, 2006 and Sept. 7, 2010. ####  ##### They will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 15, when the charges will be read out, the SFO added. ####  ##### The three men, who have already been charged by U.S. prosecutors, bring to nine the number of people charged in Britain over the manipulation of Libor, a central cog in the global financial system. ####  ##### Thirteen men have been charged globally over the scam to date — 10 for alleged yen Libor manipulation and three for alleged dollar Libor manipulation. The inquiry into Libor and a related Euribor-rigging inquiry, which stretches from North America to Asia, has also seen U.S. and European regulators fine 10 banks and brokerages a total of $6 billion to date. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ICAP, which in September settled regulatory investigations into allegations of manipulation of yen Libor, declined to comment. ####  ##### Based on a survey of what banks would charge each other for loans, traders are alleged to have colluded on answers that could nudge the reported rates by amounts that were tiny but translated into big profits. ####  ##### Libor is the primary benchmark for short-term interest rates globally and is used as a reference rate for mortgages, credit cards, student loans and other consumer lending products that the Swiss-based Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has estimated to be worth around $450 trillion. ####  ##### ICAP is the world’s largest interdealer broker, an industry designed to match buyers and sellers of bonds, currencies and swaps without bias. ####  ##### But when the brokerage last September became one of 10 institutions fined by U.S. and European authorities — the penalties now total around $6 billion — regulators laid bare a world in which, they alleged, brokers deliberately infected markets with false information to benefit their top client. ####  ##### The SFO has already charged six other men as part of its Libor investigation, including Tom Hayes, a former yen derivatives trader at UBS and Citigroup, who pleaded not guilty in a London court in December. ####  ##### Hayes, who has also been charged by U.S. prosecutors, is due to stand trial in London in January 2015 on eight charges of conspiring with staff from at least 10 banks and brokerages to manipulate yen Libor rates between 2006 and 2010. ####  ##### %%Break%% ####  ##### Terry Farr and James Gilmour, two brokers from RP Martin, have also been charged and pleaded not guilty to similar fraud-related offences in Britain. Their trial has been scheduled for September 2015, in part to allow the SFO time to bring charges against further alleged co-conspirators. ####  ##### Although the sprawling Libor investigation has generated fewer headlines since authorities announced parallel inquiries into other benchmarks, such as those in foreign exchange and swaps markets, the long-awaited Libor charges are a reminder of the insidious nature of the alleged wrongdoing. ####  ##### ICAP also remains under investigation by the European Union antitrust regulator over the alleged rate-rigging scam. ####  ##### Regulators are also examining whistleblower allegations that other benchmarks, such as those governing foreign exchange, have been manipulated. #### "

Ms. Wells was a loyal employee who had worked at Wal-Mart for 11 years, but her developmental disability made her vulnerable to predatory sexual behavior. The EEOC is here to protect the rights of people like her, and we are pleased that Wal-Mart has come forward, at an early stage, to resolve this matter without the need for further litigation.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Wal-Mart said in a statement it “does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.

"Foundry agrees to pay $160,000 in racial bias case involving noose";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reached a $160,000 settlement with a foundry in a racial discrimination case in which a noose had been found on the premises, the agency said. ####  ##### The EEOC’s case against San Antonio-based AA Foundries Inc. was originally filed in September 2011 on behalf of four black employees, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### During a three-day trial in September 2012, a federal jury heard evidence that the plant superintendent, who was the top plant official, used racial epithets, and that a noose was displayed in the workplace after racial harassment charges were filed with the EEOC. According to a news report, the three workers never saw the noose, which was hung by another worker. ####  ##### The superintendent reportedly said, though, that the noose “was no big deal” and “you people are too sensitive” when workers complained. ####  ##### The jury found in favor of three of the black employees, who are male, and awarded them punitive damages totaling $200,000, later reduced to $140,000 because of statutory caps. It found no liability regarding a fourth black female employee. ####  ##### The court also granted the EEOC’s application for injunctive relief and “permanently enjoined” the firm from “engaging in any employment practice which facilitates, condones or encourages a hostile work environment on the basis of race.” It ordered AA Foundries to implement an effective policy prohibiting race-based discrimination and to conduct training. ####  ##### AA Foundries filed an appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in October 2012, according to the EEOC, and the EEOC filed a cross appeal on behalf of the female employee. ####  ##### The company subsequently withdrew the appeal and agreed to settle the case. ####  ##### The settlement, announced Wednesday, is for $160,000 to be divided among all four employees. The company also agreed to comply with the injunctive relief ordered by the court. ####  ##### “I am pleased the resolution incorporated the full judgment,” said EEOC general counsel David Lopez in a statement. “The jury, speaking as the conscience of the community, had sent a powerful message that racial discrimination is unacceptable. It is unfortunate that nearly 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this type of unlawful harassment persists, and the EEOC will continue to work to eliminate it once and for all.” ####  ##### The company’s attorney could not be reached for comment. #### "

He sold Lehman principal protected notes to his clients before Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. Mr. Dulin represented the notes to his clients using information that UBS included in training materials and prospectuses for its brokers, said Rosemary Shockman, his lawyer in Phoenix. That included telling clients that their principal was protected, Mr. Stockman said. ####  ##### But the notes Mr. Dulin sold plummeted in value when Lehman filed for bankruptcy. Until then, Lehman had been Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank. ####  ##### Mr. Dulin is now a broker for Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit. ####  ##### Arbitrators included the $1 million punitive damages award in their ruling against UBS because the firm withheld material information about Lehman's ""sinking financial condition"" and continued to recommend the sale of the notes, according to the ruling. One of the three arbitrators who decided the case disagreed with the punitive damages award, according to the ruling. #### "
"A.M. Best assigns Torus' U.S. operations a negative outlook";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, United Kingdom, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### A.M. Best Co. Inc. has assigned Torus Insurance Holdings Ltd.'s Wilmington, Del.-based Torus Specialty Insurance Co. and Torus National Insurance Co. units a negative outlook while affirming their financial strength rating of A-, Best said Friday. ####  ##### All ratings have been removed from being under review with negative implications, the Oldwick, N.J.-based rating agency said in a statement. ####  ##### The rating actions follow completion of the acquisition of London-based Torus by Enstar Group Ltd. and Stone Point Capital L.L.C. on April 1, and Best's review of the new owners' plans for the Torus group. ####  ##### Best said the positive rating factors supporting the affirmations include the support of Enstar and Stone Point, which are expected to provide strategic and operational support to Torus, as well as financial assistance if needed. Both have a proven track record of building strong and profitable insurance businesses, Enstar in insurance runoff and Stone Point in active underwriting, Best said in the statement. ####  ##### Best said that based on the group ratings, any future rating actions for Torus Specialty and Torus National will likely be in accordance with any future rating actions on Torus group. ####  ##### “Torus' consolidated historical financial performance, as well as those of Torus Specialty and Torus National, has been weak with overall losses made each year since 2010,” said Best in the rating announcement. “Management, supported by the group's new owners, is committed to improving financial performance and has taken actions to achieve significant expense savings as well as exiting underperforming lines of business. However, despite these actions, A.M. Best believes that achieving sustainable profitable results will remain a challenge, given the strong competition in Torus' main business lines.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Positive rating actions could follow if management delivers on its plan to improve financial performance for the Torus group of companies, Best said. Likewise, negative rating actions could follow if Torus continues to underperform against its own plans and A.M. Best's expectations, said Best. ####  ##### “We are very pleased that A.M. Best's review has concluded with an affirmation of our A.M. Best ratings,” said Torus CEO Dermot O'Donohoe in a statement. ####  ##### “This reflects our strengthened capital position following a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement with a subsidiary of Enstar, which covers Torus group's discontinued lines of business; as well as actions taken to discontinue the underperforming lines and achieve significant expense savings,” he said, adding that “we are confident that Torus, with the support of our new owners, Enstar and Stone Point, is now on a solid path to future success and profitability.” #### "
"Taser lawsuit in traffic stop death dismissed on appeal";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Taser International Inc. cannot be held liable for failing to issue an additional warning about the dangers of its Taser weapon in the death of a man killed with the device by police during a traffic stop, because the police officer involved had not even read already existing warnings, said an appellate court in dismissing the case. ####  ##### Officer Jeremy Baird of the Moberly, Mo., Police Department shot Stanley Harlan in the chest with a Taser electronic control device after a traffic stop on Aug. 28, 2008, according to Thursday's ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis in Athena Bachtel v. Taser International Inc. ####  ##### Mr. Harlan fell to the ground and appeared to lose consciousness. He was pronounced dead about two hours later, and a medical examiner determined the cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest that occurred shortly after the Taser's use. ####  ##### Ms. Bachtel, Mr. Harlan's mother, originally sued the city of Moberly and several police officers for excessive force and deliberate indifference, and that case was settled for $2.4 million in June 2009, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Bachtel then sued Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser in August 2011, charging the company was liable for not having provided adequate warnings that direct deployments of the device into the chest could lead to cardiac arrest, as well as for placing a defectively designed product on the market. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### To prevail on her strict liability claim for failure to warn, Ms. Bachtel needed to demonstrate both that the product caused Mr. Harlan's death and that a warning “would have altered the behavior of the officers involved in the incident,” said the appellate ruling. ####  ##### However, “We conclude that there is no genuine dispute on this record that Officer Baird would not have read any additional warning Taser may have added about the cardiac danger” of its device, said the ruling, observing that the officer had not read warnings the company had already issued. ####  ##### Turning to the design defect claim, the appellate court said, “Missouri courts have explained that under strict liability, a manufacturer is not intended to be an insurer of any and all injuries caused by its products.” ####  ##### “We conclude that Bachtel has failed to present evidence that the (Taser) used by Officer Baird was unreasonably dangerous as designed,” said the ruling. “The evidence Bachtel points to in her brief on appeal establishes only a link between the device and the injury,” it said. ####  ##### “Since Bachtel has failed to demonstrate any 'specific design choices' that rendered the (Taser model) unreasonably dangerous, her claim fails as a matter of law,” said a unanimous three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit in affirming a ruling dismissing the case by the U.S. District Court in Hannibal, Mo. ####  ##### Appellate courts have issued different rulings on the issue of Taser's liability. For instance, in November 2013 a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court ruling on Taser's liability in the  death of a teenager but remanded the case for a new trial on the $5.5 million in damages awarded in the case. #### "
"Despite hurdles, Delphi's liability in GM recall could be tested";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — Delphi Automotive P.L.C.'s name does not appear on the outside of the 2.6 million vehicles recalled by General Motors Co. since February, but the company is getting drawn into a mounting wave of litigation for its role in producing the faulty ignition switch that prompted the recalls. ####  ##### Plaintiffs have now named Delphi, one of the largest auto parts suppliers in the world, in at least two lawsuits stemming from the recall. One was filed by a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 crash involving a recalled 2006 Chevy Cobalt, the other by customers who claim the ignition problems caused their cars to lose value. ####  ##### Delphi's legal exposure may hinge on how much control it had over decisions involving the design of the switch and the terms of its four-year bankruptcy, which ended in 2009. ####  ##### While Delphi made the part, GM set the specifications and ultimately approved its use, according to documents from civil litigation and congressional investigations. ####  ##### Delphi spokeswoman Claudia Tapia declined to comment, except to say that the company was ""working cooperatively with GM on this matter."" The company has not yet filed responses to the two lawsuits. GM spokesman Jim Cain said that Delphi owned the intellectual property for the switch but declined to comment on questions of liability or lawsuits. ####  ##### The February and March recalls center on concerns that ignition switches supplied by Delphi could unexpectedly turn off engines during operation and leave airbags, power steering and power brakes inoperable. ####  ##### GM has linked the defect to 13 deaths and has apologized for how it handled the recall and said it is committed to helping affected customers. ####  ##### Even though there's no doubt that Delphi made the ignition switch, the company would likely benefit from defenses that are not available to GM, which itself faces a spate of lawsuits over the recall. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Like GM, Delphi went through bankruptcy and emerged in 2009 as a different legal entity. In purchasing ""old"" Delphi's assets, the new company largely shed liability for past actions. The terms of Delphi's bankruptcy asset sale preclude ""successor liability,"" meaning that the new entity would generally not assume liabilities created by its predecessor. ####  ##### GM went through a similar process and also has a so-called shield from certain kinds of liabilities. But Delphi's shield is stronger. ####  ##### GM agreed to modify the terms of its bankruptcy exit to allow ""new"" GM to assume liability for post-bankruptcy accidents involving pre-bankruptcy products. ####  ##### Delphi, which emerged from a four-year trip through bankruptcy just months later, did not. ####  ##### For Delphi, ""there's that potential that there's just no responsibility at all"" said Larry Coben, a plaintiffs' attorney with the firm Anapol Schwartz, who represented GM product liability claimants during its bankruptcy. ####  ##### To penetrate this shield, plaintiffs' lawyers could mount a two-pronged argument. First, they would have to convince a judge that Delphi was engaged in an ongoing cover-up of the defects, and second, that because of this cover-up, the court should invoke ""successor liability"" and allow the suits to proceed against ""new"" Delphi. ####  ##### If plaintiffs can get past the bankruptcy issue, Delphi may also be able to invoke what is known as the ""component parts doctrine"" and argue that it doesn't bear the same responsibility as GM, since it only supplied the part and was not responsible for the overall vehicle. ####  ##### But if Delphi is found to have played a meaningful role in the design decisions, ""then they're liable,"" said Mark Geistfeld, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in civil litigation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Delphi began as a GM subsidiary and was spun off into an independent company in 1999. GM is Delphi's largest customer, accounting for approximately 17% of its net sales, according to Delphi's latest annual report. ####  ##### Delphi told congressional investigators that GM approved the original part in 2002, despite the fact that it did not meet GM's own specifications, according to a memo released by the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee. ####  ##### During a hearing on the recall on Tuesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said that both GM and Delphi engineers worked on the switch. ####  ##### The two companies, Rep. Blackburn said, ""have a shared responsibility and liability in this entire issue."" ####  ##### But that's easier said than proved in court. ####  ##### ""Ultimately, it would be up to a jury,"" said Lance Cooper, a plaintiffs' attorney from Georgia who is involved in litigation against GM. ""If Delphi makes the switch and they know it's a bad switch, they could point the finger at GM, but that's not going to keep them out of a courtroom."" #### "

"GM exploring compensation program for ignition-switch victims: Lawyer";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — A lawyer for General Motors Co. said for the first time Wednesday that the company is moving to develop a program that could compensate individuals affected by a faulty ignition switch in millions of recalled vehicles. ####  ##### The lawyer, Kenneth Feinberg, said in an interview on CNBC that, based on his initial conversations with GM, “they are asking for me to help develop some sort of program that might be used to compensate eligible claimants.” ####  ##### GM CEO Mary Barra said in testimony before Congress on April 1 that the company had hired Feinberg to help explore its options following the recall. GM since then has declined to say whether it would be creating some kind of victims compensation fund, which some members of Congress and consumers have been pushing for. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg said on Wednesday, “Now who's eligible; whether there will be a fund; how much money; what is the definition of how you are going to calculate the damages, or what proof will be required all remain to be seen.” ####  ##### Since February, the company has recalled 2.6 million vehicles and faced an increasing number of lawsuits on behalf of individuals injured or killed in crashes, as well as customers who say their cars lost value as a result of the recall. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In a related development on Wednesday, GM said it would ask a federal court to bar lawsuits related to actions before its 2009 bankruptcy, signaling a tougher stance toward legal claims stemming from the recall. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg told CNBC it could be several weeks before the actual structure of any program is clear, according to a transcript. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg is well known for his work in administering compensation funds for victims of high-profile disasters, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the BP P.L.C. oil spill in 2010. ####  ##### GM declined to comment directly on Mr. Feinberg's remarks. A company spokesman, Greg Martin, said in an email that the company recognized that it has “civic and legal obligations in regard to this matter,” and had tapped Mr. Feinberg to help them explore them. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Judge accepts SAC guilty plea, approves $1.2B settlement";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — SAC Capital Advisors L.P.'s $1.2 billion criminal settlement for insider trading received final court approval on Thursday, as a U.S. judge accepted a guilty plea from the hedge fund firm run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen. ####  ##### At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain accepted SAC Capital's guilty plea to fraud charges and payment of a $900 million fine. ####  ##### In total, SAC Capital has agreed to pay $1.8 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes into insider trading. The U.S. Department of Justice said that payout is the largest insider trading settlement in history. ####  ##### ""These crimes clearly were motivated by greed, and these breaches of the public trust require serious penalties,"" Judge Swain said. ####  ##### SAC Capital also agreed to be placed on probation for five years, and employ a compliance consultant, former federal prosecutor Bart Schwartz. ####  ##### The sentencing marks the end of an era for SAC Capital, which by last year had managed $15 billion of assets. ####  ##### An indictment in July alleged systemic insider trading took place at SAC Capital involving the stocks of more than 20 publicly traded companies from 1999 through 2010. ####  ##### Eight employees have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. SAC Capital agreed in November to plead guilty to four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. ####  ##### ""Today marks the day of reckoning for a fund that was riddled with criminal conduct,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The $900 million fine comes on top of a $900 million judgment approved in November by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in a related civil forfeiture case. ####  ##### That judgment gave SAC Capital credit for $616 million in earlier insider trading settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting in SAC Capital paying an additional $1.2 billion as part of the criminal accord. ####  ##### The Stamford, Conn.-based firm renamed itself Point72 Asset Management on Monday and is becoming a family office that will primarily manage Mr. Cohen's personal fortune, most recently estimated by Forbes magazine at $11.1 billion. ####  ##### Three of the four SAC Capital entities that pleaded guilty no longer manage investments, while the fourth may need 1½ years to shed a ""limited number of hard-to-liquidate assets,"" Martin Klotz, a lawyer for SAC Capital, said Thursday. ####  ##### As of Feb. 1, the firm oversaw $11.9 billion. Mr. Cohen started SAC Capital with $25 million in 1992. ####  ##### The settlement came amid a crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street by Mr. Bharara's office that has resulted in 80 individuals being convicted at trial or pleading guilty since October 2009. ####  ##### They include Michael Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, two SAC Capital portfolio managers who were found guilty in separate criminal trials in December and February. Both deny wrongdoing and are expected to appeal. ####  ##### Mr. Cohen, 57, has not been criminally charged. But in July, the SEC launched an administrative action to bar him from the securities industry for failing to supervise Messrs. Martoma and Steinberg and prevent insider trading. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Cohen has denied the SEC allegations, but has been in contact with the regulator regarding a possible settlement, a person familiar with the matter has said. ####  ##### Among the sticking points are whether the SEC should impose a lifetime industry ban on Mr. Cohen, or prevent employees from managing outside money, another person familiar with the case said. ####  ##### Mr. Cohen did not appear at Thursday's hearing, and his firm was represented by Peter Nussbaum, SAC Capital's general counsel. ####  ##### ""We accept responsibility for the misconduct of our employees brought before your honor,"" Mr. Nussbaum said. ####  ##### Mr. Swain had also been expected Thursday to weigh a request for more than $1.5 million in restitution from SAC Capital by Elan Corp., a company at the heart of Mr. Martoma's case and now owned by Perrigo Co. ####  ##### SAC Capital had objected to the request but settled with Elan before the hearing, said Terence Healy, a lawyer for Elan. ####  ##### Asked by Judge Swain during the hearing questioned the scope of Mr. Schwartz's consultant role, Antonia Apps, an assistant U.S. attorney, said he would have a ""broad mandate"" to evaluate and review SAC's compliance procedures and identify deficiencies. ####  ##### ""While they may have had compliance policies on paper, they were clearly deficient in deferring insider trading,"" Ms. Apps said. ####  ##### The case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors L.P., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-cr-00541. #### "
"NY restaurant owner must pay lesbian chef $1.6M for sex-bias, firing";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### The owner of a Mexican restaurant in New York City, who held prayer meetings in which he said gay people were “going to hell,” must pay a jury award of $1.6 million in damages to a lesbian chef who had filed a sexual orientation discrimination law suit against him, says a New York appeals court, in upholding a jury award. ####  ##### A New York Supreme Court jury had awarded chef Mirella Salemi a $1.6 million award, including $400,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress and $1.2 million in punitive damages, in December, 2012, according to the ruling by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. The appeals court's ruling in Mirella Salemi v. Gloria's Tribeca Inc. was issued March 20 but only publicized last week. ####  ##### Evidence “amply supports” the jury's verdict that, in violation of the New York City Human Rights law, Gloria's Tribeca's owner, Edward Globokar, discriminated against Ms. Salemi by, among other things, holding weekly prayer meetings during which it was repeatedly stated that homosexuality is a sin and that gay people “were going to hell “and “generally subjecting her to an incessant barrage of offensive anti-homosexual invective.” ####  ##### The unanimous 5-0 ruling said also that Ms. Salemi was retaliated against for objecting to Mr. Globokar's improper conduct, for choosing not to attend the workplace prayer meetings, and for refusing to fire another employee because of his sexual orientation, and that she was improperly discharged. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The appeals court said the trial court had protected Mr. Globokar's First Amendment rights by instructing the jury that he had a right to express his religious beliefs and practices, provided he did not discriminate against his employees based on religion or sexual orientation. ####  ##### The appeals court said the compensatory damages award does not “materially deviate” from awards in similar case and that the punitive damages awards was not “grossly excessive” given “the extensive evidence of defendant's discriminatory conduct.” #### "

"Ford worker's disability bias, retaliation case over telecommuting reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### An appeals court has reinstated a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed on behalf of a disabled Ford Motor Co. worker who was denied a telecommuting arrangement and terminated. ####  ##### Jane Harris was hired as a resale buyer in 2003 at Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford, where her job involved acting as an intermediary between steel suppliers and stampers, the companies that use steel to produce parts for Ford, according to Tuesday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ford Motor Co. ####  ##### Ms. Harris suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, an illness that causes fecal incontinence, and her symptoms worsened over time. She began to take intermittent time off under the Family Medical Leave Act when she experienced severe symptoms, according to the appeals court ruling. ####  ##### In 2005, her supervisor allowed her to work on a flex-time telecommuting schedule on a trial basis but decided it was unsuccessful because Ms. Harris could not establish regular and consistent hours, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Harris formally requested permission to telecommute on an as-needed basis as an accommodation for her disability in 2009, but her supervisors concluded her position was not suitable for telecommuting. ####  ##### In April 2009, Ms. Harris filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC. She was terminated later that year. ####  ##### In 2011, the EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court in Ann Arbor, Mich., charging that Ford violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to accommodate Ms. Harris' disability and by retaliating against her for filing a charge with the EEOC. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The federal court granted summary judgment dismissing the case, ruling in part that Ms. Harris did not qualify for her failure-to-accommodate claim because of her excessive absenteeism. ####  ##### The three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit reinstated the case in a 2-1 ruling. ####  ##### “Harris is indisputably disabled under the ADA,” according to the ruling. Ford has the burden of proving her physical presence in the workplace is an “essential function of her position” but “cannot indisputably carry its burden,” states the ruling. ####  ##### “Advancing technology has diminished the necessity of in-person contact to facilitate group conversations,” states the ruling. “Although Ford has provided significant evidence that physical attendance was an essential function of the resale buyer position, the EEOC has offered at least enough evidence genuinely to dispute this conclusion,” the ruling states. ####  ##### The majority ruling held also that “Ford has not met its burden of proving that a telecommuting accommodation, even if reasonable, would create an undue hardship.” ####  ##### It also overturned dismissal of the retaliation claim. “Viewed in a light most favorable to Harris,” the evidence presented “creates a genuine dispute as to whether Ford was truly motivated by retaliatory intent or by a reasonable business decision to terminate an underperforming employee,” says the ruling. ####  ##### “The EEOC has presented evidence on which a reasonable jury could conclude that Ford retaliated against Harris for filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC,” said the court, in remanding the case for further proceedings. ####  ##### The dissenting opinion states the EEOC has failed to prove that Ford's proffered reason for its action was a pretext for discrimination. #### "

Benhar later hired a nonpregnant applicant instead. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on pregnancy. ####  ##### In addition to monetary relief, the settlement also requires that Benhar provide training on laws prohibiting employment discrimination. The three-year consent decree also requires the company to distribute and post a revised anti-discrimination policy and to provide to the EEOC all employee complaints of sex and/or pregnancy discrimination. ####  ##### “Employers have a duty to respect the ability of pregnant women to participate in the workforce,” said EEOC Acting Regional Attorney Robert D.

Sign Inc., a family-owned signage manufacturer in Round Lake, Illinois. The lawsuit accused Mr. Schane of violating federal telephone consumer law and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. ####  ##### According to court documents, State Farm denied Mr. Schane's initial claim for reimbursement of his defense costs, citing the federal law and related-statutes exclusion in its business liability policy. ####  ##### A month after his claim was denied, Mr. Schane settled the initial lawsuit with G.M. Sign and the other plaintiff companies for $4.9 million, which the plaintiff companies agreed to collect from Mr. Schane's insurer. ####  ##### However, State Farm refused to pay the settlement, arguing that the same exclusion that barred Mr. Schane from defense cost coverage in the underlying lawsuit also applied to any settlement payments on his behalf resulting from the litigation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The appellate court panel ultimately concurred with State Farm's argument in its May 2 ruling, which overturned a February 2013 decision by a Lake County Circuit Court judge. ####  ##### “Fundamentally, the court agreed that the policy exclusion for claims arising directly or indirectly out of actions which violate the TCPA extended to alternative theories premised on the same facts,” Michael Borders, a Chicago-based managing member at Dykema Gossett P.L.L.C. and one of State Farm's lead attorneys in the case, said Wednesday in a statement. ####  ##### Mr. Borders said the appellate court's ruling is the first opinion published in Illinois — and among the first nationwide — to interpret the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and related statutes exclusion that State Farm and other insurers began adding to their standardized business liability insurance policies in 2006. ####  ##### “We are very pleased with this outcome and believe that this decision may have nationwide ramifications for the insurance industry and for similarly styled TCPA class action cases moving forward,” Mr. Borders said in the statement. #### "

"Generic drug manufacturers can't be sued in Fosamax case: Court";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Plaintiffs who took the generic version of the osteoporosis drug Fosamax are pre-empted by federal law from pursuing litigation against its manufacturers, says an appellate court, in upholding a lower court ruling. ####  ##### Generic drugs by law must mimic brand name drugs and prior rulings have found that generic manufacturers should not be held liable for brand name defects, according to Tuesday's ruling by the 3rd U.S. District Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in In re: Fosamax (alendronate sodium) products liability litigation. ####  ##### In February, 2011, 91 plaintiffs who had used both Fosamax, which is produced by White House Station, New Jersey-based Merck & Co. Inc., and its generic versions filed a products liability suit in Missouri state court against both Merck and generic manufacturers for damages related to bone fractures they suffered after taking prescribed versions of either Fosamax or its generic version, alendronate sodium. Fosamax is a drug used to treat or prevent osteoporosis and other bone diseases. The litigation was later centralized in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J. ####  ##### In a series of orders, the federal district court dismissed all the generic defendants from the case, ruling the plaintiffs' claims were pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their design defect claims. A three-judge panel of the appeals court unanimously upheld the lower court. ####  ##### In its opinion, the panel pointed to two Supreme Court rulings: In Pliva Inc. v. Mensing, the high court held in March, 2013 that litigation against generic drug manufacturers could not go forward because it is impossible for them to comply simultaneously with the state duty to adequately warn and “their federal duty of sameness,” the federal law that requires generic drug labels to be the same as their branded counterpart.” ####  ##### And in June, 2013, in Bartlett v. Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., the high court held that state law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are pre-empted by the Pliva ruling. ####  ##### The prior rulings, “recognize that manufacturers have no control over the design or labeling of generic drugs,” said the appeals court ruling.” The plaintiffs “have failed to identify anything the generic defendants can do to reconcile their conflicting duties under state and federal law,” said the court, in affirming the lower court ruling dismissing generic manufacturers from the case. #### "

Safe Harbor framework. ####  ##### The Safe Harbor was developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission to reconcile the European Union's standard for privacy protection, which is based on comprehensive legislation, with the different approach taken by the United States, which relies on a mix of legislation, regulation and self-regulation, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. It was approved by the European Union in 2000. ####  ##### To participate in the voluntary program, firms self-certify annually to the Department of Commerce. ####  ##### The FTC charged that American Apparel deceptively claimed it held current certifications under the U.S.-E.U. framework and the separate U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework. ####  ##### The FTC said that American Apparel represented through statements in its privacy policy that the company held current Safe Harbor certifications, even though it had allowed its certifications to lapse.

"EEOC reaches $2.4M settlement in Thai farm worker mistreatment suit ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reached a $2.4 million settlement on part of litigation filed three years ago in which a farm labor contractor and six farms were charged with national origin discrimination and retaliation in connection with their alleged mistreatment of Thai farm workers. ####  ##### The settlement, announced Monday by the EEOC, involves four of the farms named as defendants and includes monetary relief, options for jobs and benefits, housing, other reimbursements of expenses, and sweeping injunctive relief remedies benefiting about 500 Thai workers in the EEOC's case, the agency said. ####  ##### Defendants named in the settlement were Captain Cook, Hawaii-based Mac Farms of Hawaii L.L.C.; Kalaheo, Hawaii-based Kauai Coffee Co. Inc.; Kunai, Hawaii-based Kelena Farms Inc.; and Burlingame, California-based Captain Cook Coffee Co. Ltd. ####  ##### The EEOC initially filed its lawsuit against Los Angeles, California-based farm labor contractor Global Horizons Inc. and the farms in U.S. District Court in Honolulu in April 2011, in which it charged the defendants with trafficking Thai workers to farms in Hawaii and Washington State, where they were allegedly subjected to mistreatment and discrimination. ####  ##### The EEOC said in its statement that the Thai farm workers were contracted through Global Horizons to work at the farms sometime between 2003 and 2007 under the H2-A temporary visa program, which required the farm workers to be provided food and housing along with pay for work performed. ####  ##### The EEOC said exorbitant recruitment fees placed the Thai workers in a situation of “debt bondage” early on, and workers were then subjected to varying degrees of the denial or delay of pay; monitoring movements and confiscating passports; production quotas that non-Thai workers did not have to adhere to; denial of adequate food and water, and unsanitary, overcrowded living conditions. ####  ##### The EEOC said those who complained were retaliated against, with many forced to quit or flee as a result. ####  ##### Coral Gables, Florida-based Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc., originally named one of the defendants, agreed to pay $1.2 million in November 2013 to settle the  suit against its Hawaii subsidiary. ####  ##### In March of this year, a federal judge found Global Horizons liable for harassment, discrimination and retaliation for its treatment of the workers, and set Nov. 18 for a trial to determine the amount of money it will pay for the abuses Thai workers suffered, as well as the measures Global will need to implement to prevent future abuses. ####  ##### Global Horizons and Kahului, Hawaii-based Maui Pineapple Co., whose operations were reportedly shut down in 2009, remain as the only defendants in the case, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement, Mac Farms will pay $1.6 million, Kauai Coffee will pay $425,000, Kelena Farms will pay $275,000 and Captain Cook Coffee will pay $100,000 directly to the workers, for a total of $2.4 million. ####  ##### Among other terms of the settlement, Kelena Farms offered full-time jobs with benefits, profit-sharing and 401(k) plan options, while Captain Cook offered seasonal jobs, benefits, transportation and housing for workers during the three-year terms of their decrees. The offers extended by Kelena and Captain Cook are valued at close to another $4.9 million, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “Today's announcement serves as a reminder to the agricultural industry to remain ever-vigilant in hiring and monitoring farm labor contractors,” said Anna Y. Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles district, in a statement. ####  ##### “We all have a responsibility to ensure that the most vulnerable workers are not denied basic human dignity and life-sustaining water and food. Farms and farm labor contractors — and the supervisors that represent them — must ensure workers' civil rights remain intact, no matter their race or the country they come from.” ####  ##### Attorneys for the farms either had no comment or could not be reached. #### "

"U.S. safety regulators probe Chrysler airbag recall";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — U.S. safety regulators are investigating Chrysler Group L.L.C.'s 2012 recall of 744,822 sport utility vehicles in the United States after six consumers complained of inadvertent airbag deployments even after fixes were made. ####  ##### The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents filed on Monday that it had opened a query into the recall of Jeep Liberty SUVs from model years 2002 and 2003, and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs from model years 2002 through 2004. The safety agency will study the effectiveness of the previous recall. ####  ##### Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., said in a statement that it had notified NHTSA of the six incidents involving inadvertent airbag deployments while the vehicles were in operation and was cooperating with the safety agency's investigation. ####  ##### Chrysler recalled the vehicles on Nov. 7, 2012, because airbag circuits could degrade. The company addressed the problem by installing an in-line jumper harness with an integrated electrical filter to eliminate electrical spikes that the company believed were causing the problem, according to the NHTSA documents. The safety agency had previously opened an investigation of the issue in October 2011 and three months later upgraded the probe. ####  ##### In the latest six cases in the NHTSA documents, no crashes were reported, but injuries consisting of cuts and burns were alleged. ####  ##### At the time of the recall in 2012, another 174,723 SUVs were affected in Canada, Mexico and outside of North America. The probe found 215 cases of inadvertent airbag deployments that resulted in 81 minor injuries in the United States but no crashes. #### "
"Watchdog urges E.U. leaders to shield citizens from snooping";"Risk Management";"European Union, Germany";" ##### (Reuters) — European Union countries need stricter controls to protect citizens from spying, a top data protection official said on Thursday, a warning that may rekindle a debate about snooping before an E.U. summit next week. ####  ##### Revelations by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden about mass surveillance of global Internet traffic and phone records have prompted calls in Europe for tighter safeguards and a review of data-sharing agreements with the United States, but so far with few concrete results. ####  ##### In a letter to European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, data protection official Peter Hustinx expressed concern that EU heads of state might fail to make a strong enough commitment to protect their citizens. ####  ##### “The allegations of mass surveillance by security services have rocked the trust in the ability and willingness of governments and businesses to protect individuals' personal information,” Mr. Hustinx wrote, without singling out the United States or mentioning Snowden specifically. ####  ##### “The importance of data protection in building the European area of freedom, security and justice cannot be overstated,” he said. ####  ##### The intervention of the official responsible for the protection of E.U. staff's personal data comes shortly after Germany's public prosecutor launched an investigation into the alleged bugging of Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone by U.S. intelligence. ####  ##### Data protection will be one of the items on the agenda when Ms. Merkel and other leaders meet for two days of talks on June 26. ####  ##### A draft statement to be issued at the summit, seen by Reuters, said it would be “crucial to ensure the protection of fundamental rights, including data protection, while addressing security concerns.” ####  ##### But the intervention from Mr. Hustinx, who also sits on a group of European privacy watchdogs, implied that this did not go far enough and underscores a growing sense of alarm among some officials that Europe's response to U.S. spying has been limp. ####  ##### Last year, the European Union backed down on threats to suspend an agreement allowing U.S. companies to gather customer information in Europe and send it to the United States, outside the E.U.'s legal jurisdiction. ####  ##### On Wednesday Ireland's High Court asked Europe's top court to review the agreement in light of allegations that the U.S. National Security Agency used companies such as Facebook and Apple to gather data on Europeans. ####  ##### The E.U. is set to discuss the data-transfer agreement, known as Safe Harbor, with the United States on Wednesday. ####  ##### The snooping dispute could also complicate attempts by Brussels and Washington to reach a free-trade pact encompassing almost half of the world's economy. #### "

"Fired worker ordered reinstated after NLRB finds no-gossip rule 'overly broad'";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A Georgia technical college unlawfully terminated an employee on the basis of its “overly broad” no-gossip policy, says the National Labor Relations Board, which has ordered the worker's reinstatement and the policy's withdrawal. ####  ##### Joslyn Henderson worked as an admissions representative for Decatur, Georgia based Laurus Technical Institute, a private, for-profit technical school, according to a Dec. 11, 2013 ruling by an administrative law judge in Laurus Technical College and Joslyn Henderson, which was affirmed by three members of the NLRB board on Friday. ####  ##### In 2011, Ms. Henderson filed a charge against the school with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging sexual harassment and retaliation by one of the school managers. ####  ##### She was subsequently chastised by the school's CEO for discussing her work issues and complaints with a manager who was not in her chain of command. ####  ##### Nine days later, on Feb. 22, 2011, the school issued a “no gossip policy” that said in part, “Employees that participate in or instigate gossip about the company, an employee, or customer will receive disciplinary actions.” ####  ##### Ms. Henderson was subsequently promoted to senior admissions representative. On Oct. 29, 2011, however, while she was out on unpaid medical leave, another worker reported she had talked negatively about the company and some of its workers, and had become “verbally aggressive.” Ms. Henderson was suspended on Oct. 29 and terminated on Nov. 12 for “willful breach of company polices and counterproductive behavior.” ####  ##### Laurus' no-gossip rule “on its face prohibits protected activity,” said the administrative law judge's ruling. Its language is “overly broad, ambiguous and severely restricts employees from discussing or complaining about terms and conditions of employment,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “A thorough reading of this vague, overly broad policy reveals that it narrowly prohibits virtually all communications about anyone, including the company or its managers. ####  ##### “In fact, read literally, this rule would preclude both negative and positive comments about a person's personal or professional life unless that person and/or his/her supervisor are present.” Such a policy on its face violates the National Labor Relations Act, says the ruling. ####  ##### In its ruling Friday, the NLRB ordered Laurus to rescind its policy, offer Ms. Henderson reinstatement to her former job or an equivalent position, and reimburse her for any loss of earnings or other benefits she had suffered. #### "

"Supreme Court rules for POM against Coca-Cola in labeling dispute";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that drink producer POM Wonderful can sue over allegations that The Coca-Cola Co. has misled consumers over its marketing of Minute Maid pomegranate blueberry juice. ####  ##### The court ruled in favor of POM on an 8-0 vote, with Justice Stephen Breyer recused. POM had filed a lawsuit against Coca-Cola saying that it had misled customers by selling a pomegranate blueberry juice even though it had 0.5% of the two juices. ####  ##### Both a U.S. District Court in California and a federal appeals court said that POM could not bring its claims under the federal Lanham Act, but the Supreme Court reversed that finding. ####  ##### Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote on behalf of a unanimous court that challenges such as POM's are permitted even though food and beverage labels are regulated under another federal law, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. ####  ##### The lower courts had said it was the prerogative of the Food and Drug Administration, and not private parties, to object to juice labels which are potentially misleading. ####  ##### Justice Kennedy wrote that, contrary to what Coca-Cola argued, the two laws complement each other. He noted, for example, that the FDA ""does not have the same perspective or expertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day competitors possess."" ####  ##### POM, which makes a product that is 100% pomegranate juice, had filed the lawsuit saying that the Minute Maid juice label was misleading and would hurt sales for its own product. ####  ##### The Minute Maid juice is sold as a ""Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices."" It is mostly apple and grape juice with just 0.3% pomegranate juice and 0.2% blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing. ####  ##### Pomegranate and blueberries are popular with health-conscious Americans because they contain antioxidants that some believe prevent cancer and heart disease, although the science behind that belief is unclear. ####  ##### Justices do not usually reveal why they recuse themselves in cases so it not known why Justice Breyer did not participate. The case is POM Wonderful L.L.C. v. The Coca-Cola Co., No. 12-761. #### "

The agency said he would also stare at, and comment on, the breasts and bodies of SunTrust’s female clients who came into the branch. ####  ##### The EEOC said numerous complaints by female employees to the assistant branch manager and other SunTrust branch managers were ignored, and that SunTrust failed to take sufficient action to stop the harassment once its human resources department got involved. ####  ##### The EEOC said during the course of its investigation into the discrimination charges, the branch manager voluntarily resigned but was subsequently rehired by the bank. ####  ##### The company was charged with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as Florida state laws. Under terms of the settlement, in addition to paying the $300,000, the bank has agreed to conduct annual live training for its managers and human resources personnel, among other provisions. ####  ##### “It is critical for employers to take prompt action once an employee reports sexual harassment,” Tampa, Florida-based EEOC director Georgia Marchbanks said in a statement. “The women in this case expected to work in a professional environment and should not have been subjected to ongoing harassment by their supervisor.” ####  ##### The bank said in a statement, “SunTrust has a strong commitment to a harassment-free work environment. This was an isolated matter, and the accused team member is no longer employed at the company. ####  ##### “In accordance with our policy, this matter was promptly and fully investigated when made known to SunTrust.

"HP wins dismissal of lawsuit linked to ex-CEO Hurd's ouster";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### (Reuters) — Hewlett-Packard Co. has won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the computer maker of securities fraud for misleading shareholders about its commitment to ethics while its chief executive was allegedly engaging in sexual harassment. ####  ##### In August 2013, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco had thrown out an earlier version of the lawsuit, and on Wednesday dismissed a revised version that he said failed to address his concerns. Wednesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the lawsuit cannot be brought again. ####  ##### Before the case arose, HP had updated its Standards of Business Conduct following a 2006 scandal over news leaks. ####  ##### The lawsuit stemmed from the sudden August 2010 departure of Chief Executive Mark Hurd amid allegations that he had harassed an independent consultant, Jodie Fisher. Mr. Hurd, who is now president of Oracle Corp., had won wide credit at HP for improving the company's fortunes. ####  ##### An internal HP probe ultimately cleared Mr. Hurd of harassment but found that he filed inaccurate expense reports. Plaintiffs led by the Retail Wholesale & Department Store Union Local 338 Retirement Fund of Mineola, New York, claimed that HP's share price was inflated during the period of Mr. Hurd's alleged misconduct. ####  ##### They said the Palo Alto, California-based company's statements about its business conduct standards led them to believe Mr. Hurd was in compliance. ####  ##### Last August, Judge Tigar called HP's statements too vague and general to justify liability, but gave the plaintiffs another chance to make their case. ####  ##### On Wednesday, he said the new complaint offered more detail about Mr. Hurd's conduct and whether it violated HP's rules, but still did not show that Mr. Hurd's or HP's representations amounted to a ""warranty of ethical compliance"" with the SBC. ####  ##### ""Accordingly,"" Judge Tigar wrote, ""plaintiff has not stated a securities law violation."" He also said Mr. Hurd's failure to disclose his non-compliance with the SBC was not a ""materially false"" omission. ####  ##### Ira Press, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. HP did not immediately respond to similar requests. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment. ####  ##### The case is Retail Wholesale & Department Store Union Local 338 Retirement Fund v.

"Walgreen to pay fired diabetic employee who took bag of chips $180,000";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Walgreen Co. has agreed to pay $180,000 to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with firing an 18-year employee with diabetes after she allegedly ate a bag of chips without paying for it to stave off a low blood sugar attack. ####  ##### Josefina Hernandez developed diabetes about five years after she started working as a cashier at a South San Francisco, California store operated by Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen, according to court papers. ####  ##### Walgreen, which knew about her condition, had allowed Ms. Hernandez to possess candy in case of low blood sugar, keep her insulin in the break room refrigerator and take additional breaks to test her blood sugar or eat because of her diabetes, according to court papers. ####  ##### On Sept., 18, 2008, she suffered a hypoglycemic attack while restocking items and grabbed a $1.39 bag of potato chips from the store to stabilize her condition. She claimed she went to pay for it, but finding no one at the cosmetics counter where she had been instructed to pay for store items, she put the remaining potato chips under the counter at her cash register and returned to restocking items. She was terminated on Oct. 8, 2008, for violating the chain's “anti-grazing” policy. ####  ##### The EEOC field suit against the chain in September 2011, charging it with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Walgreen filed a motion seeking summary judgment dismissing the case. The U.S. District Court in San Francisco denied the motion in an April 11, 2014, ruling. ####  ##### Judge William H. Orrick held in that ruling that it was up to a jury to decide whether Ms. Hernandez's disability was the cause of her misconduct, and whether Walgreen should have been required to accommodate her theft as a reasonable accommodation. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement approved by Judge Orrick, in addition to paying Ms. Hernandez the $180,000, the company will post a revised policy regarding accommodation of disabled employees on its employee intranet site and provide anti-discrimination training, among other provisions, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### EEOC San Francisco regional attorney William R. Tamayo said in a statement that not only was Ms. Hernandez's termination “harsh and unfair, but it was illegal, and that's why the EEOC sued to correct this wrong. People may think this case revolves around theft, but the real issue is how a company responded to a valued 18-year employee, whom it knew for 13 years to be diabetic, and who attempted to pay for the chips after she recovered from her hypoglycemic attack.” ####  ##### A Walgreen spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. #### "
"Insurers sue asbestos trust for records, say they suspect fraud";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers";" ##### (Reuters) — Six insurance companies are suing an asbestos personal injury trust set up by a U.S. unit of Philips Electronics North America Corp. that the insurers suspect has been making millions of dollars in fraudulent payments to parties that cannot prove they were harmed by the company's asbestos products. ####  ##### In the lawsuit, the insurers — AIU Insurance Co., American Home Assurance Co., Birmingham Fire Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, Granite State Insurance Co., Lexington Insurance Co. and National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. — are seeking access to trust records. ####  ##### The insurers said the asbestos personal injury, or PI, trust set up during the 2008 bankruptcy of T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition L.L.C., a unit of Philips, had been paying substantially more claims than originally forecast. ####  ##### ""Plaintiffs have a reasonable suspicion that fraudulent claims have been submitted to and paid by the asbestos PI trust,"" said the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in Delaware's Court of Chancery. ####  ##### The lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal and legislative actions aimed at shedding light on the trusts, which have been used for decades to compensate people injured by exposure to cancer-causing asbestos. ####  ##### Dozens of companies have filed for bankruptcy in the wake of thousands of lawsuits and then set up trusts that collectively control tens of billions of dollars. ####  ##### The six insurers were seeking to conduct an audit of trust records as part of a bankruptcy agreement with T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition, or THAN, Philips Electronics North America and the asbestos trust. ####  ##### An attorney who represented THAN as well as the asbestos trust said the lawsuit had no merit because the insurers were offered the opportunity to audit the trust's claims in compliance with the bankruptcy plan. ####  ##### ""They want to conduct a different audit than the one contemplated by the agreement,"" said Sander Esserman of Stutzman, Bromberg, Esserman & Plifka P.C. in Dallas. ""I suspect the lawsuit will not receive any traction in the courts."" ####  ##### Philips Electronics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### THAN filed for bankruptcy in 2008 in the wake of thousands of lawsuits by people alleging they were made sick by the asbestos the company distributed until 1980. ####  ##### In exchange for setting up the $900 million trust, all future asbestos-related claims against THAN were directed to the trust. ####  ##### The six insurers agreed to make installment payments to Philips Electronics North America based on the distributions by the asbestos trust. They said in their lawsuit they may have paid $25 million more than they should have due to the suspected fraud. ####  ##### In January, a judge found in the bankruptcy of Garlock Sealing Technologies that personal injury lawyers had repeatedly sought claims from asbestos trusts after their clients told courts they had no exposure to the products the trusts were compensating for. ####  ##### Federal and state lawmakers have also proposed bills that would increase disclosure from the asbestos trusts. ####  ##### The case is AIU Insurance Co. et al. v. Philips Electronics North America Corp. et al., Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 9852. #### "
"Health system settles disability suit over leave policy for $1.35M ";"Risk Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Disability";" ##### A New Jersey health care system has agreed to pay $1.35 million to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for its fixed leave policy. ####  ##### However, Plainsboro, New Jersey-based Princeton HealthCare System, which operates an inpatient hospital and several outpatient medical facilities, said in a statement it had revised its policy in 2010. ####  ##### The EEOC said Monday that Princeton's fixed leave policy failed to consider leave as a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### The agency said Princeton's leave policy merely tracked the requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act, and that employee leaves were limited to a maximum of 12 weeks. This meant employees who were not eligible for FMLA leave were fired after being absent for a short time, and many more were fired once they were out for more than 12 weeks, said the EEOC. ####  ##### Under the consent decree settling the suit, in addition to paying the $1.35 million, Princeton is prohibited from having a blanket policy that limits the amount of leave time an employee covered by the ADA may take, among other provisions, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “This is the latest in a series of cases challenging unlawful leave policies, and the relief obtained here furthers the EEOC's efforts to reinvigorate the Americans with Disabilities Act following the 2008 amendments,” said EEOC general counsel David Lopez in a statement. “While the EEOC is always careful and cautious before resorting to litigation, our efforts here should encourage employers to voluntarily comply with the ADA.” ####  ##### Princeton said in a statement: “The case involved a human resource policy that was in place a number of years ago and was changed in 2010. As part of this settlement, the EEOC has reviewed the hospital's current policies and our ongoing program for training employees and supervisors, and has stated that it has no objection to the hospital's current policies and training program. ####  ##### “In this lawsuit, the EEOC claimed that 23 employees were negatively impacted by the previous policy. Although the hospital disagrees that the prior policy violated the ADA and challenged the claims, the hospital has agreed to resolve those matters in order to avoid the very high cost and disruption of operations caused by the ongoing litigation. The hospital has always been and remains fully committed to a workplace free of any discrimination.” ####  ##### A recent federal appeals court ruling that  allows employers to set rigid disability leave guidelines is the first to bump up directly against the EEOC's policy of promoting more flexible policies for injured or ill workers. #### "
"Chrysler expands ignition switch recall by 696,000 vehicles";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — U.S. safety regulators announced an expansion on Monday of a previous recall to include more model years of Fiat Chrysler vehicles that have ignition switches that can be inadvertently shut off. ####  ##### Added to a previous recall were model year 2008-2009 Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, and 2009 Dodge Journey crossover vehicles. The previous recall affected the same three models from the 2010 model year. ####  ##### Chrysler said in a statement that the expanded recall is being done “out of an abundance of caution” and includes an additional 695,957 vehicles, in addition to the previous recall of 196,000 vehicles, in North America. ####  ##### Officials with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also want more information from Chrysler about the inadvertent cutting off of engines and air bags because of potentially faulty ignition switches on 2006-2007 Jeep Commander and 2005-2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs. The NHTSA is also investigating the Jeep models. ####  ##### General Motors Co announced the recall on Monday of 8.23 million mostly older models, including the Chevrolet Impala, because of ignition switch defects. Three deaths are linked to the latest GM recall. ####  ##### So far this year, GM has recalled about 29 million vehicles worldwide, about half of them for ignition switch issues. ####  ##### As for the Journey and minivans recall, the NHTSA said it wants more information from Chrysler on why a remedy for potentially defective ignition switches might not solve the issue of air bags not deploying in a crash. ####  ##### Chrysler said it proposed a remedy that would make it more difficult to inadvertently bump the ignition from the “run” to “accessory” position while driving, which turns off the engine and the air bags. ####  ##### Chrysler said it is aware of two accidents and no injuries in the affected Journey, Grand Caravan and Town & Country models. #### "
"HSBC reaches $10M settlement over foreclosure charges";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — HSBC Holdings Plc. has agreed to pay $10 million to settle U.S. civil fraud claims over foreclosure-related charges it submitted to the government, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday. ####  ##### The accord resolves claims under the False Claims Act concerning government allegations that HSBC failed to oversee the reasonableness of the charges it submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Federal Housing Administration and Fannie Mae. ####  ##### HSBC spokesman Rob Sherman declined immediate comment. ####  ##### The office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, which announced the settlement, has been investigating several banks over whether they overcharged the government for expenses incurred during foreclosures on federally-backed home loans. ####  ##### These loans are either insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is part of HUD, or guaranteed by government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ####  ##### A typical foreclosure can cost $1,000 to $3,000, with much of the sum going to legal fees. #### "
"Judge wants grocery chain held in contempt for ignoring disability bias decree";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Disability";" ##### A federal magistrate judge has recommended that the Supervalu Inc. supermarket chain be held in contempt of court and sanctioned for violating a court decree entered to resolve an Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuit against the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based firm, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said. ####  ##### The recommendation by Federal Magistrate Judge Michael Mason on Tuesday to the U.S. District Court in Chicago stems from a $3.2 million settlement of charges in January 2011 that Supervalu unit Jewel-Osco terminated employees with disabilities at the end of medical leave rather than bringing them back to work with reasonable accommodations. ####  ##### The EEOC said Wednesday in a statement that Jewel-Osco has been under the terms of a three-year consent decree since the settlement. ####  ##### The magistrate judge's ruling said “the evidence is overwhelming that the company did not do what it was supposed to do under the decree.” It said Jewel-Osco was in contempt of court when it violated the provision of the consent decree enjoining the company from discriminating “on the basis of disability by not providing reasonable accommodations to persons desiring to return to work from a disability leave.” ####  ##### Judge Mason recommended that Jewel-Osco pay a total of $82,000 in back pay to three former employees who were denied accommodation. He also recommended that the court extend the consent decree by one year and order that a special master, paid by the company, review the decisions made by the company and its medical accommodations to ensure compliance with the decree. ####  ##### “Consent decrees have teeth,” John Hendrickson, regional attorney in the EEOC's Chicago district office, said in the statement. “Courts do not look kindly upon open and notorious violations of the consent decrees they enter, nor, as this decision shows, upon employers who attempt to mischaracterize the evidence which the court itself has seen introduced. Jewel-Osco ought to have known better on both counts, and we must hope that Magistrate Judge Mason's findings will sound an alarm with respect to the company's compliance with the federal employment discrimination laws, including the ADA.” ####  ##### Supervalu said in a statement that it divested itself of Jewel-Osco in March 2013 and therefore does not have any comment to offer on this decision. A Jewel-Osco spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "

"Appeals court revives BP retirement-plan lawsuit";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Retirement Benefits, Energy";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit in which participants in four BP p.l.c. employee retirement savings plans claimed they were deceived into buying and holding BP stock before and after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. ####  ##### The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said that a ruling last month from the U.S. Supreme Court upended the reasoning applied by a lower court that had dismissed the class action suit two years ago. ####  ##### A unanimous three-judge panel ordered U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison in Houston to take another look at the claims of participants in the retirement savings plans. ####  ##### The participants said the value of a BP stock fund in which their money was invested fell by $1.85 billion in the months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion killed 11 workers and caused the worst ever U.S. offshore oil spill. ####  ##### The participants alleged that BP misled them as investors, and as early as 2007 overstated the safety controls the company had in place. ####  ##### They also alleged that fiduciaries who were charged with managing the retirement savings plans breached their duties by failing to sell off BP stock and take other actions to protect investors. ####  ##### Judge Ellison dismissed the lawsuit in March 2012, finding that plan fiduciaries enjoyed a legal presumption that they acted prudently. ####  ##### The U.S. Supreme Court, though, did away with the presumption last month in a different case, and the appeals court said the development meant Judge Ellison should reconsider the suit. ####  ##### In May, Judge Ellison ruled in a separate shareholder suit that another set of investors who bought BP’s American depository shares soon after the explosion may pursue claims as a group. ####  ##### “The Fifth Circuit today remanded the ERISA case to the district court in light of new pleading standards set forth by the Supreme Court,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in a statement. “BP does not believe the plaintiffs satisfy these new standards and intends to renew its motion to dismiss in the district court."" ####  ##### An attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond. #### "
"Bank of America pays AIG $650M to settle mortgage disputes";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, AIG";" ##### (Reuters) — Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay American International Group Inc. $650 million to settle long-running legal disputes over defective mortgage-backed securities sold in the run-up to the financial crisis. ####  ##### The deal, which the parties announced early Wednesday, ends securities fraud litigation that the insurer brought against Bank of America. It also removes the biggest obstacle to the bank's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities issued by Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender Bank of America acquired in 2008. ####  ##### AIG will file notices dismissing its litigation accusing the bank of causing billions of dollars in losses by selling it shoddy mortgage securities. The litigation is pending in New York and California. ####  ##### For the past three years, AIG led opponents in holding up court approval of a settlement Bank of America reached in June 2011 with institutional investors to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims over $174 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the housing crisis. ####  ##### The investors said Countrywide had misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis. ####  ##### Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc., Allianz S.E.'s Pimco and Metlife Inc., and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the trustee for the securities, agreed to the settlement. ####  ##### AIG claimed there was no evidence that the deal provided adequate compensation for losses. ####  ##### Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court gave the go-ahead for the bulk of the settlement in January, withholding her approval only from settlement of claims involving certain loans that had been modified. But AIG appealed Justice Kapnick's decision. ####  ##### As part of the agreement, AIG agreed to withdraw its objection. In a release on Wednesday morning, the insurer said it would receive its pro rata share of whatever is ultimately paid out to investors in connection with that settlement. ####  ##### A group of funds known as the Triaxx entities and the Chicago Police pension fund remain as objectors. ####  ##### The $650 million settlement was covered by litigation reserves as of June 30, Bank of America said. ####  ##### As part of the deal, Bank of America said it was settling three actions it brought to collect mortgage insurance proceeds due from AIG`s United Guaranty mortgage insurance subsidiaries on loans it had originated and serviced. ####  ##### The cases are American International Group Inc. et al. v. Maiden Lane II L.L.C., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-00951, and American International Group Inc. et al. v.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Wal-Mart Transportation L.L.C., which was filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey, on July 10, charges that Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart was “careless and negligent in the ownership and operation” of the truck, which caused Mr. Morgan and other victims “severe personal injuries.” ####  ##### It charges also that the retailer should have known it was unreasonable for the driver, Kevin Roper, to commute more than 700 miles from his home in Jonesboro, Georgia, before starting his shift at a Wal-Mart facility in Smyrna, Delaware, “especially immediately before he was to commence a long shift operating a truck that weighed approximately 30-40 tons.” ####  ##### It states there were many Wal-Mart distribution facilities closer to Mr. Roper's home, including at least nine in Georgia alone, which would have significantly reduced his commute to work. ####  ##### It says that Mr. Roper, who began his shift at 11:22 a.m. June 6, hit the limousine carrying Mr. Morgan at 12:54 a.m. June 7 after he fell asleep at the wheel. It states also he was driving 65 mph in a 45 mph zone at the time of the accident. ####  ##### The lawsuit says also that the state-of-the art, 2011 Wal-Mart truck did not automatically brake before the accident, as it was designed to do. ####  ##### The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, among other compensation. Mr. Morgan, who was traveling from an appearance in Delaware at the time of the accident, has just been released from a rehabilitation facility, according to news reports. ####  ##### Wal-Mart said in a statement, “This has been a terrible tragedy” and that the company's thoughts continue to go out to the accident's victims and the families and friends of everyone involved, including those of James McNair, who was killed in the crash. ####  ##### The estate of Mr. McNair is not among the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit. ####  ##### “We are deeply sorry that one of our trucks was involved. As we've said, we're cooperating fully in the ongoing investigation.

"Lloyds Bank fined $370M for rigging Libor interest rates";"Risk Management";"United Kingdom";" ##### (Reuters) — Britain's Lloyds Banking Group P.L.C. has agreed to pay fines totaling $370 million to U.S. and British authorities investigating its part in a global interest rate rigging scandal and manipulating fees for a U.K. government lending plan. ####  ##### The settlement is the seventh joint penalty handed out by American and British regulators in connection with the attempted manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and other similar benchmarks used to price around $450 trillion of financial products worldwide. The misconduct related to Libor rates for sterling, the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. ####  ##### The penalties for Lloyds comprise a £105 million ($178.3 million) fine by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, $105 million by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and an $86 million fine by the U.S. Department of Justice. ####  ##### The FCA said there had been routine manipulation of sterling Libor submissions to benefit money market trading positions between September 2006 and June 2009. ####  ##### To avoid negative media comment and market perceptions of its financial strength, Bank of Scotland, which Lloyds later acquired, manipulated Libor submissions as a result of at least two management directives in September and October 2008, the FCA said. ####  ##### It said that in September 2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a global meltdown in markets, a manager instructed a trader to lower dollar Libor submissions. ####  ##### ""I've been pressured by senior management to bring my rates down into line with everyone else,"" a third trader said. ####  ##### Emails uncovered by the FCA showed traders seeking to peg Libor quotes to ""suit the books."" The FCA said there was a culture among traders of seeking to take a financial advantage wherever possible. ####  ##### For example, on July 19, 2007, when a Lloyds manager was informed by a Lloyds trader about a request made to another Lloyds trader for a low rate, the trader commented that ""every little helps ... It's like Tesco's,"" repeating an advertising slogan used by Britain's biggest retailer. ####  ##### The Lloyds manager replied ""Absolutely, every little helps."" ####  ##### Lloyds was rescued by a £20.5 billion ($34.80 billion) government bailout during the financial crisis after a government-engineered takeover of HBOS P.L.C. turned sour. Taxpayers still hold a 25% stake in the bank five years later. ####  ##### Lloyds' settlement follows British rivals Barclays P.L.C. and Royal Bank of Scotland P.L.C., which agreed to pay fines of $453 million and $612 million respectively in 2012 and 2013. ####  ##### The FCA said the total U.K. fine included £70 million ($118.8 million) for attempting to manipulate fees payable to the Bank of England for the firm's participation in the special liquidity scheme, a taxpayer-backed government initiative to support British banks during the financial crisis. ####  ##### The FCA fine included a 30% discount for early settlement. ####  ##### Britain's financial regulator said 16 individuals at Lloyds, seven of them managers, were directly involved in or aware of the various forms of Libor manipulation, including one manager who was also involved in the repo rate misconduct. ####  ##### ""Their behavior involved a gross breach of trust, and we condemn it without reservation,"" Lloyds Chairman Norman Blackwell said Monday. ####  ##### The Bank of England said Lloyds has paid it £7.8 million ($13.2 million) in compensation for the reduction on the amount of SLS fees it received as a result of manipulation. ####  ##### Lloyds' behavior was ""highly reprehensible and clearly unlawful,"" the BoE said in a statement. ####  ##### In a related action, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Lloyds, deferring criminal wire fraud charges in exchange for Lloyds continuing to cooperate and agreeing to an $86 million penalty. ####  ##### Shares in Lloyds barely moved on the news, which had been widely flagged, and were up 0.1% at 74.9 pence ($1.27) at 1250 GMT. #### "

Trust 2007-HE7, the correct information about how many of the mortgages they contained were delinquent, the release said. ####  ##### The market for residential mortgage-backed securities reached $2.2 trillion in 2007 but a wave of mortgage defaults made the values of many of the securities plunge in 2008, causing the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers to collapse and eventually leading to a credit and liquidity crisis on Wall Street and a deep economic recession. ####  ##### ""Morgan Stanley understated the number of delinquent loans behind these securitizations during a critical juncture of the financial crisis and denied investors the full extent of the facts necessary to make informed investment decisions,"" said Michael Osnato, the chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Complex Financial Instruments Unit, in the release. ####  ##### As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley neither admitted nor denied the charges. ####  ##### ""We're pleased to settle the matter,"" said Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley. ####  ##### The two RMBS issues in the case were the last subprime RMBS Morgan Stanley sponsored, issued and underwrote. According to the SEC, the two deals' offering documents said less than 1% of their loan pools' principal balances were delinquent at the time the securities were formed. In reality, 17% of the loans in one of the issues and 4.5% of the loans in the other were delinquent at that time. ####  ##### The SEC said Morgan Stanley had a chart showing the 17% delinquency rate for one of the two issues. And it did not tell investors it had had to delay the closing of the other one by a month, at which time it had received updated information on the number of delinquent loans showing they made up 4.5% of the total. ####  ##### The SEC said it would return the money collected in the settlement to investors who were harmed by the bank's misrepresentations. Its announcement did not include the names of the investors. #### "
"Greenbrier says rapid phase-out of older oil-by-rail tank cars doable";"Risk Management";"Canada, Energy";" ##### (Reuters) — A top U.S. railcar maker, The Greenbrier Companies Inc., said on Wednesday a two-year timeline to retire older railcars that carry dangerous flammable liquids, including North Dakota Bakken crude, is “aggressive” but can be done. ####  ##### Those comments came after the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed new safety standards for moving crude and ethanol by rail in light of several fiery accidents over the past year. ####  ##### The proposed standards suggest phasing out older cars built before October 2011, which is when the industry adopted a newer design with 7/16-inch thick steel hulls, reinforced valves and head shields on railcars' front, back or both to better protect against leaks in a derailment. ####  ##### “A two-year timetable for phasing out the use of older DOT-111 cars in the most hazardous flammable service is aggressive, but can be met with appropriate retrofit packages and new car design,” Greenbrier spokesman Jack Isselmann said. ####  ##### The older models, known as DOT-111s and built since the late 1950s, lack valve protection and heat shields. DOT-111s were the type of railcars in several of the past year's crashes, including a runaway train that careened into a small Quebec town and exploded, killing 47 people. ####  ##### Several U.S. refiners that receive crude by rail already use only post-October 2011 railcars as their projects started up after that. Others are phasing out older ones this year as post October 2011 models come in. ####  ##### But DOT's proposed rules suggest several options for tank cars built after October 2015, two of which call for 9/16-inch thick steel hulls. A third option would maintain the 7/16-inch standard in the post-October 2011 models. ####  ##### James Rader, senior vice president of Watco Companies L.L.C., the second-largest short-line railroad operator in the U.S. with oil-by-rail operations, said at a June conference in Houston that DOT's measures could go beyond the October 2011 industry standard with thicker hulls and other protections. ####  ##### In his presentation, Mr. Rader said about 40% of cars that carry crude now are newer ones. He projected that by the end of 2015 the fleet of newer cars would be about 55,546 — larger than today's fleet of 48,503 cars carrying crude. ####  ##### Some predicted capacity constraints but others have said the industry usually overbuilds during boom times. ####  ##### “That three-year turnaround time — two years from the October 2015 date — is going to be a bit tight based on shop capacity for tank cars,” said Jason Seidl, analyst at Cowen & Co. ####  ##### Justin Long, an analyst at Stephens Inc., a financial services firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, said at the Houston conference that railcar manufacturers have “a history of overbuilding, and we don't think this cycle will be any different.” ####  ##### While railcar makers and maintenance companies may see more business from tighter regulations, shipping and leasing companies will see rates rise, Mr. Long said. ####  ##### They might have to pay about $10,000 in disposal fees to scrap an old car, or more than $130,000 for a new one. ####  ##### Consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. said this week that retrofitting is estimated to cost $30,000 to $60,000 per tank car. ####  ##### Most companies that retrofit railcars are privately held, while Greenbrier and American Railcar Industries Inc. are public. ####  ##### Makers of new cars include Greenbrier, American Railcar, Trinity Industries Inc. and Union Tank Car, owned by Berkshire Hathaway. ####  ##### Greenbrier in February began marketing a newer tank car design with 9/16-inch thick steel, as well as stronger top and bottom outlet protection and an outer steel jacket with ceramic insulation. ####  ##### Greenbrier last month said customers had ordered 3,500 of that style of newer tank car. ####  ##### This week Greenbrier and Watco formed GBW Railcar Services, a joint venture combining their 38 railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance shops in anticipation of swifter business. #### "
"Alabama health system, doctors group settle whistleblower kickback case for $24.5M";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits";" ##### An Alabama health system and a physicians group have reached a $24.5 million settlement of a whistleblower lawsuit, in which they were charged with violating the False Claims Act by paying or receiving kickbacks in connection with claims to the Medicare program, the Department of Justice said Monday. ####  ##### The DOJ’s lawsuit charged that two clinics affiliated with Mobile, Alabama-based Infirmary Health System Inc. had agreements with Mobile, Alabama-based Diagnostic Physicians Group P.C. to pay the group a percentage of Medicare payments for tests and procedures referred by its physicians, in violation of the Physician Self-Referral Statute — or Stark Law — and the Anti-Kickback Statute. ####  ##### The Department said these laws are intended to ensure that a physician’s medical judgment is not compromised by improper financial incentives. The Anti-Kickback Statue prohibits offering paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals or items or services covered by federal healthcare programs including Medicare. The Stark Law forbids hospitals or clinics from billing Medicare for certain services referred by physicians who have financial relationship with the entity. ####  ##### Whistleblower Dr. Christian Heesch, a physician formerly employed by Diagnostic Physicians Group, who originally filed the lawsuit under the whistle-blower provisions of the False Claims Act, will receive $4.41 million as his share of the settlement, the DOJ said. ####  ##### “Today’s settlement represents a single but significant step towards achieving integrity in the administration of public health programs in this region,” said U.S. Attorney Kenyan Brown for the Southern District of Alabama, in Mobile, in a statement. “Physicians, physician groups and other medical entities operating illegally within public health programs will be held accountable. I also commend whistle blowers like Dr. Christian Heesch, who helped bring this particular case to light.” ####  ##### Infirmary Health CEO Mark Nix said in a statement, “Every day our doctors, nurses and employees work to provide the highest quality of care to the 800,000 patients we treat each year. This agreement to settle these claims represents our strong desire to move past litigation about what has been a very complex issue and allow us to end this distraction so that we can focus on our mission and purpose as a community healthcare provider. ####  ##### “Earlier this year, Infirmary Health and Infirmary Medical Clinics were dismissed from this lawsuit as well as a separate but related lawsuit filed by a former system physician. This settlement will allow us to avoid additional expenses of defense and the distractions associated with litigation. Our intent has always been to comply with the very complex and extremely technical Stark Law. This complaint resulted from what has been a disagreement with the government over our interpretation of the law as written.” ####  ##### “It is very important to note that this suit focused solely on highly complicated contracts with physicians. Our patients received all of the medical services ordered by their physicians and those services were billed at the appropriate rates. ####  ##### “Our mission statement is L.I.F.E., defined as Leadership, Integrity, Family and Excellent Service. Today, with this matter behind us, we can focus on what means the most to us: providing superior quality care for our patients.” ####  ##### Attorneys for Diagnostic Physicians Group could not be reached for comment. ####  ##### In February, long-term care pharmacy firm Omnicare, based in Cincinnati, agreed to pay the government $4.2 million to settle charges in a whistleblower suit that it engaged in a kickback scheme with a drug manufacturer in violation of the False Claims Act, the DOJ said. #### "
"Case against Boeing for firing worker with migraines can proceed";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A federal court has refused to dismiss a Family Medical Leave Act violation claim by a Boeing Co. employee who was terminated after she attempted to take FMLA leave for her migraines, stating there is evidence the company discriminated against her. ####  ##### Jill Alexander's managers knew since at least 2000 that Ms. Alexander, who worked for the Chicago-based company from 1996 to 2013, suffered from migraines and missed work because of them, according to Monday's ruling by the U.S. District Court in Seattle in Jill Alexander v. Boeing Co.. ####  ##### From about 2009 through 2013, Ms. Alexander would telecommute sporadically because of her migraines, and they became more frequent beginning in 2013, according to the ruling. Meanwhile, beginning in April or May 2012, Boeing told its employees they could no longer work from home if they were sick or work partial or flexible days. ####  ##### In June 2012, Ms. Alexander was told for the first time that she could apply for unpaid FMLA leave to cover absences caused by her migraines, and she took intermittent FMLA leave for the reminder of the year. However, because she was no longer allowed to work partial or flexible days, her absences were “far more frequent than they were before and her reviews suffered as a result,” said the ruling. She was also disciplined for what Boeing deemed to be “unexcused' absences, said the ruling. ####  ##### On May 2, 2013, Ms. Alexander's supervisor and a human resources employee received notification she had applied for FMLA leave for April 29 through May 3. Despite this notification, they decided to terminate her for “job abandonment” because she had not come to work, and fired her on May 3, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Alexander filed suit against the company in District Court in Seattle, charging violation of the FMLA as well as state law claims. There is “direct evidence that Boeing's decision to terminate the plaintiff was due to her absences from April 29 through May 2, 2013,” said the ruling by Judge Richard A. Jones. ####  ##### “However, if those absences were covered by the FMLA, Boeing's consideration of those absences as a 'negative factor' in the termination decision violated the FMLA,” the ruling said. ####  ##### The ruling also says that Boeing argued Ms. Alexander was ineligible for FMLA leave beginning Jan. 1, 2013, because she had not accrued the required 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to the request leave. ####  ##### However, while she does not dispute she worked only 1,203.2 official hours for the period, she contended she attained the required total by working at least 2.5 hours per week that were not included in her regular or overtime hours. Accordingly, said the ruling, “the court finds that genuine disputes of material fact exist” as to whether she was eligible for FMLA leave, said Judge Jones. ####  ##### Ms. Alexander “has presented sufficient evidence that creates triable issue of fact regarding whether Boeing's discipline and termination for plaintiff's absenteeism (conduct resulting from her migraines) demonstrates discriminatory motive,” said the court, in denying Boeing's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, Jeff Nowak, a partner with law firm Franczek Radelet P.C. in Chicago, said, “Migraines can be deceptive for employers. Many employees deal with them and work through these kinds of headaches, so when an employee takes time off for a migraine headache, employers often don’t track those days as FMLA leave, even though the regulations clearly indicate that employers should.” ####  ##### Experts have said that employers run the risk of noncompliance with the FMLA when employees request intermittent leave for chronic health conditions, including migraines. #### "
"Bank of America ordered to pay $1.27B for Countrywide fraud";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Bank of America Corp. to pay $1.27 billion of damages after a federal jury found the second-largest U.S. bank liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan ruled nine months after jurors found Bank of America and former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone liable for defrauding government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through the sale of shoddy loans by the former Countrywide Financial Inc in 2007 and 2008. ####  ##### The case centered on a mortgage lending process known as “High Speed Swim Lane,” “HSSL” or “Hustle,” and which ended before Bank of America bought Countrywide in July 2008. ####  ##### Investigators said the program emphasized quantity over quality, rewarding employees for producing more loans and eliminating checkpoints designed to ensure the loans’ quality. ####  ##### “While the HSSL process lasted only nine months, it was from start to finish the vehicle for a brazen fraud by the defendants, driven by a hunger for profits and oblivious to the harms thereby visited, not just on the immediate victims but also on the financial system as a whole,” Judge Rakoff wrote. ####  ##### Judge Rakoff based the penalty on 17,611 Hustle-generated loans, for which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac paid $2.96 billion to Countrywide. He said the damages award reflected a finding by a government expert that only some of the loans had material defects, while others were acceptable. ####  ##### The government had sought $2.1 billion of penalties. Judge Rakoff also directed Ms. Mairone, a former mid-level Countrywide executive who was the only individual charged in the case, to pay $1 million. The government had sought about $1.2 million. ####  ##### Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the $1.27 billion award “simply bears no relation to a limited Countrywide program that lasted several months” and ended before the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank bought the company. “We’re reviewing the ruling and will assess our appellate options.” ####  ##### Ms. Mairone later began to work at JPMorgan Chase & Co., and used her maiden name of Rebecca Steele. Her lawyer, Marc Mukasey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York, who brought the case, declined to comment. ####  ##### Both defendants had denied wrongdoing and said they should not be penalized. Bank of America also said Countrywide actually lost money selling the loans once costs were factored in. #### "

"E.U. executive wants to beef up bloc's financial watchdogs";"Risk Management";"European Union, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers";" ##### (Reuters) — The European Union's trio of new financial watchdogs should have more powers over banks, insurers and markets to ensure national regulators apply E.U. rules, the bloc's executive body said on Friday in a review that may raise hackles in Britain. ####  ##### The European Commission's review looked at the three European Supervisory Authorities, or ESAs, set up in 2011 to improve oversight of the 28-country bloc's markets and banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis uncovered failings. ####  ##### The London-based European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, and Frankfurt, Germany-based European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority have performed well during their first three years but need stronger powers to assert themselves, the review found. ####  ##### ""In particular, the ESAs should give a higher profile to issues related to consumer/investor protection, and strengthen the focus on supervisory convergence,"" the European Commission said in a statement. ####  ##### Consumer protection has traditionally been left to national supervisors in the E.U. but this is now changing with ESMA being given powers to ban harmful products directly. ####  ##### Britain wants a new ""settlement"" with the E.U. to curb and reverse the shift of powers, particularly over finance, from national to E.U. level ahead of a possible in/out referendum on U.K. membership in 2017. ####  ##### The review recommends medium-term actions that would need changes in the law. ####  ##### The authority and role of chairmen of the ESAs could be strengthened to take ""swift decisions in the interest of the E.U. as a whole"", meaning making it harder for a national regulator to shield one of its banks or insurers from an E.U. rule. ####  ##### The authorities could also be given ""direct access to data"" so they would not have to rely on national regulators if they wanted to scrutinize a bank or market in more detail. ####  ##### Their remit could be extended to enforcing accounting rules, checking on how banks calculate their capital buffers and directly supervising clearing houses, all steps that would dilute the powers of national watchdogs. ####  ##### Currently, the ESAs are 60% funded by national governments with the rest from the E.U.'s budget, and the review said both sources should be abolished and that fees or levies on banks, insurers and markets would need to be analyzed. ####  ##### The review added that any fees or levies would be proportionate, meaning tailored to the size of a firm. ####  ##### The Commission also wants to see the authorities flex their ""binding mediation powers"" to order a national watchdog to comply with E.U. rules, a step none has wanted to take so far given the political sensitivities it would raise. ####  ##### There could also be a need for more radical structural changes such as locating all the authorities in one place. ####  ##### E.U. states and the European Parliament will now decide how to take forward the recommendations. ####  ##### Incoming European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said a ""capital markets union"" is one of his top themes, raising further concerns in Britain that Brussels will seek to centralize more power at the expense of London. ####  ##### The European Systemic Risk Board was also launched in 2011 and is based at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt to act like a helicopter hovering above the financial system to spot broader risks such as destabilizing asset bubbles. ####  ##### Jacques de Larosiere, the former IMF chief and key architect of the E.U. watchdogs, said last year that the ESRB was difficult to stir and get into action — one of its recommendations was made after a problem had already been solved. ####  ##### ""Europe needs a sailor at the top of the mast who looks at possible systemic dangers,"" Mr. de Larosiere told a hearing. ####  ##### The review said the ESRB had done important analysis of risks but needed streamlining and a more ""proactive communication strategy."" Further studies would be conducted to enhance the watchdog's ""visibility and autonomy."" ####  ##### The ESRB is chaired by ECB President Mario Draghi and the review said a new managing director role could strengthen the board's own identity. #### "
"Private equity firms pay $325M in U.S. collusion settlement";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — Three of the world's largest buyout firms have agreed to pay $325 million to settle a U.S. lawsuit accusing them of colluding with rivals to keep prices down on corporate takeovers prior to the financial crisis by agreeing not to outbid each other. ####  ##### The payment by Blackstone Group L.P., KKR & Co. L.P. and TPG Capital L.P. will benefit shareholders of some merger targets during a buyout boom that predated the 2008 financial crisis. The settlement was disclosed in a Thursday court filing. ####  ##### Six defendants in the nearly 7-year-old lawsuit have now agreed to pay a combined $475.5 million in various settlements without admitting wrongdoing. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston will consider preliminary approval of the accords at a Sept. 4 hearing. ####  ##### Carlyle Group L.P. is the only remaining defendant among 11 firms originally sued, and faces a Nov. 3 trial. ####  ##### ""These claims are without merit and we will continue to vigorously contest the allegations,"" Carlyle said in a statement. ####  ##### In the December 2007 lawsuit, which relies heavily on email evidence, private equity firms were accused of conspiring to drive down takeover prices and reduce competition by following ""club rules,"" often teaming up on buyouts and providing quid pro quos to influence each other's behavior. ####  ##### The lawsuit now covers eight buyouts in which the firms allegedly agreed not to ""jump,"" or outbid, each other after buyouts were announced. ####  ##### ""It's a pretty good settlement,"" said Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ""Antitrust cases like this are tough, and there aren't many class action settlements approaching $500 million like this one."" ####  ##### In one case, soon after a KKR-led group agreed in July 2006 to buy hospital chain HCA Inc., a Blackstone executive allegedly wrote that the $32.1 billion price ""represents good value and is a shame we let KKR get away with highway robbery."" ####  ##### And after a Blackstone-led group in September 2006 beat out KKR to buy Freescale Semiconductor Inc. for $17.5 billion, Blackstone President Hamilton ""Tony"" James emailed KKR co-founder George Roberts that he would ""much rather"" work together, and that ""in opposition we can cost each other a lot of money."" ####  ##### Twenty-seven buyouts were originally part of the case. A federal judge in March 2013 threw out claims over alleged collusion before buyouts were announced. ####  ##### Other buyouts remaining in the case are movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Inc., food service firm Aramark Corp., casino operator Harrah's Entertainment Inc., pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc., software maker SunGard Data Systems Inc. and power company TXU Corp., now called Energy Future Holdings. ####  ##### Blackstone, KKR and TPG will apportion the $325 million payment among themselves. KKR said it settled to end the distraction and cost of litigating. Blackstone declined to comment. TPG was not immediately available to comment. ####  ##### Last month, Silver Lake Partners L.P. settled with the plaintiffs for $29.5 million. In June, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bain Capital Partners L.L.C. settled for a respective $67 million and $54 million. ####  ##### Carlyle had prior to Thursday signaled its plan to fight on. In an Aug. 1 court filing, it said the ""plaintiffs' entire case fails"" because they could not show that anyone, but for the alleged collusion, would have jumped others' buyouts. ####  ##### The case is Dahl et al. v. Bain Capital Partners L.L.C. et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 07-12388. #### "

"Nursing assistant fired in 15th week of pregnancy can sue: District Court";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A pregnant nursing assistant who was immediately fired during her 15th week of pregnancy, after she told her employers she could not lift 20 pounds once she reached her 20th week, can pursue her pregnancy discrimination claim, says a federal District Court. ####  ##### Araceli Cadenas’ job at the Meadowbrook Manor’s nursing and rehabilitation facility in Naperville, Illinois, required her to pull, push or lift at least 20 pounds as she fulfilled duties that included placing belts around residents’ chests or waists and using their own weight to pull and lift the resident up, according to the ruling by the federal District Court in Chicago in Araceli Cadenas v. Butterfield Health Care II, c/b/a Meadowbrook Manor of Naperville et al. ####  ##### Ms. Cadenas was terminated while she was 15 weeks pregnant, after she presented a doctor’s note stating she could not lift more than 20 pounds once she reached her 20th week of pregnancy, although at that point she could still work without restrictions, according to the ruling, which was issued July 15, but publicized last week. ####  ##### “At a minimum … Meadowbrook was entitled to fire Cadenas as of the 20th week of her pregnancy when, it is undisputed, she would no longer be able to do her job effectively,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “The question remains whether as a matter of law Meadowbrook could terminate Cadenas at 15 weeks of pregnancy before the restrictions took effect,” the ruling said. ####  ##### “Meadowbrook never suggested, or provided evidence, that there was any business reason not to let Cadenas work during the five weeks remaining before her restrictions went into effect,” the ruling said. ####  ##### “Without any physical restrictions applicable between weeks 15 and 20 of Cadenas pregnancy, Meadowbrook has pointed to no non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cadenas effectively immediately,” said the court. ####  ##### “A jury could reasonably conclude she was terminated in her 15th week for a reason other than physical limitations — namely, discrimination based upon her pregnancy,” said the court, in denying Meadowbrook motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### Last month, a pet food manufacturer that fired a lab technician an hour after learning she was pregnant, citing safety concerns for both mother and baby, agreed to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission pregnancy discrimination case for $30,000. #### "
"Low temperature a factor in Boeing 787 battery meltdown in Japan: Report";"Risk Management";"Japan";" ##### (Reuters) — Cold winter temperatures were a factor in the meltdown of a lithium ion battery that caused a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner to make an emergency landing in Japan last year, the Asahi newspaper said, citing the conclusions of local investigators. ####  ##### The battery meltdown on the ANA Holdings Inc.-owned plane prompted authorities to ground the global fleet of Dreamliners for more than three months. ####  ##### It followed an incident less than two weeks earlier at Boston Airport when a battery on a parked Japan Airlines 787 overheated and emitted white gases. ####  ##### Low temperatures can cause a lithium ion battery to deteriorate, resulting in the risk of a short circuit, Kyodo News reported separately. The battery is located in an unpressurized, unheated part of the plane. ####  ##### The Japan Transport Safety Board plans to release a final report on its findings as early as September, the Asahi said, without citing sources. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for accident investigators declined to comment on the report. ####  ##### Boeing won approval for Dreamliner flights to resume after it redesigned the battery compartment to isolate thermal events and vent hot gases outside the aircraft. ####  ##### The Dreamliner is Boeing's state-of-the-art plane, built with carbon-fiber composite materials and a powerful electrical system to reduce weight and improve the jet's fuel efficiency. #### "
"Alliant releases annual report on political risks in oil and gas frontier markets";"Risk Management";"Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Latin America, Middle East/Africa, Political Risk";" ##### Alliant Emerging Markets, a unit of Alliant Insurance Services Inc., has released its ranking of political risks in important oil and gas frontier markets, the Frontier Energy Risk Index. ####  ##### The yearly risk climate rankings are intended to give oil and gas companies an idea of changes in political risk levels in 14 different emerging economies with potential for producing oil and gas, the Newport Beach, California-based broker said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### The rankings are based on macroeconomic and political risk loss data, according to the statement. ####  ##### Ecuador had the largest positive gain (22%) from 2013 because of its improving macroeconomic forecast. Algeria and Libya are also considered less risky because of a “marginal reduction in war and civil war risk” in those countries, according to the rankings. ####  ##### Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Angola and Kazakhstan all had positive gains from 2013. Yemen remained the same. ####  ##### Egypt's rating increased by 5%, but investors and companies should still be cautious, the reports says. ####  ##### “Egypt has emerged from a long run of political instability, and a recent regime change to show some positive movement in our risk models,” Michel Léonard, chief economist with Alliant Emerging Markets, said in the statement. “However, we remain guarded about its long-term prospects and warn investors not to confuse gradual improvements with medium or long-term structural stability.” ####  ##### Indonesia had the biggest year-to-year downgrade with a 62% ratings drop. ####  ##### “The downgrade is largely due to the newly imposed restrictions on foreign investments, first in the mining sector, and now in the oil & gas sector,” Mr. Léonard said. “We expect this trend to continue regardless of the upcoming presidential elections.” ####  ##### Military tensions in the South China Sea mean that Vietnam is risky for oil and gas companies and investors, according to the rankings. ####  ##### “Chinese authorities' decision to move an oil rig into Vietnam's exclusive economic zone is the most notable of many recent confrontations between China and other countries in the South China Sea,” Mr. Léonard said. “In the long term, we expect China's actions to lead not to territorial expansion, but to China being granted rights to production in the waters it is claiming. Oil & gas companies should be aware of the changes this will bring to any current or future licensing agreements signed in the South China Sea, especially with Vietnam.” ####  ##### Thailand and Malaysia were also downgraded from their 2013 ratings. #### "
"Oil spill from power plant closes 15-mile stretch of Ohio River";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Energy";" ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Coast Guard closed a 15-mile stretch of the Ohio River on Tuesday after at least five thousand gallons of fuel oil spilled from a 60-year-old power plant owned by Duke Energy 20 miles east of Cincinnati. ####  ##### The spill occurred at 11:15 p.m. on Monday during a “routine transfer of fuel oil” at the W.C. Beckjord plant in New Richmond and was stopped 15 minutes later, Duke said. ####  ##### Intakes for drinking water along the river were closed overnight, and drinking water has not been affected, said a spokeswoman for the Greater Cincinnati Water Works, though tests continue. The impact on wildlife was so far unclear. ####  ##### “We notified state and local authorities of the incident and have been working with them throughout the overnight hours,” said Chuck Whitlock, Duke Energy president of Midwest Commercial Generation. “We have cleanup crews on site that are identifying the appropriate actions that will be needed to remediate.” ####  ##### The Coast Guard said the river was closed from mile markers 453 to 468, from Cincinnati to Dayton, Kentucky, while it responded to the spill. Three vessels were on the scene on Tuesday deploying oil containment booms and clean-up materials. The Coast Guard’s initial estimate was that 8,000 gallons were spilled. ####  ##### The W.C. Beckjord Station is being retired as a result of new government emissions standards. Four of the plant’s six coal-fired units have been closed, and the remaining two are expected to shut down by the end of the year. It also has four fuel-oil-fired units that generate power during periods of peak demand. ####  ##### The Ohio River, which stretches nearly 1,000 miles from Pennsylvania to Illinois, provides drinking water for more than three million people, according to the Ohio River Foundation. ####  ##### It is also a major artery for shipping grain by barge from the eastern United States to export terminals on the Gulf Coast. With the corn and soybean harvest still weeks away, however, traffic has been relatively light. ####  ##### “There is not a lot of stuff coming down the Ohio River right now, but four weeks from now it will be very busy,” said Roy Huckabay with the Linn Group, a Chicago brokerage. #### "

"Insurers can withstand $100B natural catastrophe: Zurich";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich";" ##### (Reuters) — The growing market for catastrophe bonds has bolstered the insurance industry to the extent it could cope with a $100 billion disaster bigger than Hurricane Katrina, the head of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.'s general insurance division said. ####  ##### Known as ""alternative capital,"" the money investors are pouring into catastrophe bonds — sold by insurers to share the risk they take on for natural disasters — and other areas of the insurance industry is increasing competition and putting pressure on traditional players. ####  ##### But the new capital also means the industry is more robust and able to cope with what Zurich's general insurance chief Michael Kerner sees as a growing trend of large catastrophe losses caused by climate change. ####  ##### ""The insurance and the reinsurance industry are at very strong levels of solvency, there is lots of capital in the business,"" Mr. Kerner told Reuters. ""The industry can handle a $100 billion event, all the claims get paid, it's not a big solvency issue."" ####  ##### ""We do need to access all forms of capital to be able to provide the appropriate risk transfer solutions. In this context, some of this alternative capital is really a good thing, because it has expanded the capacity of the insurance industry to be able to handle these bigger events,"" Mr. Kerner said. ####  ##### The natural catastrophe bond market issued record volumes during the second quarter, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory said in July, with investors attracted to the sector in search of higher returns as interest rates remain at rock-bottom levels. ####  ##### Katrina, in 2005, was one of the biggest hurricanes ever recorded and the costliest natural disaster, racking up $80 billion in damages for the insurance industry, according to 2013 data from reinsurer Swiss Re Ltd. ####  ##### Zurich took a hit of around $600 million after tax and reinsurance from the hurricane in 2005. ####  ##### The first half of 2014, however, has been relatively calm, with floods, storms and other natural disasters causing around $42 billion in damage worldwide, well below the prior-year period and a 10-year average, German reinsurer Munich Reinsurance Co. said in July. ####  ##### ""The area of risk potentially is that some of this capital is not actually being asked to respond,"" Mr. Kerner said. ""This is capital dedicated to catastrophe losses, but we have not had a major catastrophe in a while, so this capital has not yet been tested."" ####  ##### The capital will be able to stand the strain of a major natural catastrophe, Mr. Kerner said, adding the question was whether investors would be willing to replenish it afterwards. #### "
"Judge rejects Silicon Valley employee poaching lawsuit settlement agreement ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A federal judge has refused to approve a settlement agreement between plaintiffs and high-tech firms over the issue of an alleged nonpoaching agreement among the Silicon Valley companies, stating the amount offered the workers was inadequate. ####  ##### A legal expert said the ruling represents a trend towards close judicial scrutiny of class action settlements. ####  ##### Despite the agreement between defendants and plaintiff attorneys, Judge Lucy H. Koh in the U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, on Friday refused to OK an agreement under which workers would receive $324.5 million to settle the class action litigation against Mountain View California-based Adobe Systems Inc., Cupertino, California-based Apple Inc., Mountain View-based Google Inc. and Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp. ####  ##### Plaintiffs had charged that the defendants had entered into an “overarching conspiracy through a series of bilateral agreements” to not solicit one another’s employees in violation of federal law, according to Judge Koh’s ruling in In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation. ####  ##### Judge Koh said under terms of the agreement, defendants will pay a total of $324.5 million, and workers will receive an average of about $3,750 each after $18 million in attorneys’ fees, $1.2 million in costs and $80,000 per class representative in incentive payments is deducted. There are about 64,000 affected workers, according to a news report. ####  ##### “The court finds the total settlement amount falls below the range of reasonableness,” she said. She said if this case had been settled on the same basis of a much weaker case against other defendants in related litigation, which was settled a year ago, plaintiffs would receive at least $380 million. ####  ##### Defendants in the case either had no comment or could not be reached. ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, defense attorney Michael W. Kelly, a partner with law firm Squire Patton Boggs L.L.P. in San Francisco, said: “From the defense bar’s perspective it’s significant, because it continues to represent close judicial scrutiny of settlement decisions between the parties in class actions, with the courts imposing their own assessment of the likelihood of success.” ####  ##### Mr. Kelly said if the two sides want to settle, “it is clear they would have to come back with a number that’s at least $380 million, if not in excess of $380 million.” #### "
"OFF BEAT: Puppet maker says CBS violated copyright on gassy stuffed hippo";"Risk Management";"";" ##### There are some phrases one simply never expects to encounter in a professional context — and until now, “the farting hippo” was certainly among them. ####  ##### Folkmanis Inc., an Emeryville, California-based puppet manufacturer, has sued CBS Broadcasting Inc. for illegally copying one of its stuffed animal designs for a line of merchandise related to the network’s “N.C.I.S.” television program. ####  ##### According to documents filed Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, “N.C.I.S.” has been using a stuffed hippopotamus manufactured by Folkmanis as a prop since 2003. On the show, the toy belongs to an eccentric U.S. Naval forensic scientist who has named it Bert the Farting Hippo. For comedic effect, a superimposed fart sound is emitted whenever one of the characters gives Bert a squeeze. ####  ##### Over time, the toy became a popular recurring gag on the show. CBS began selling replicas of Bert the Farting Hippo in 2010 that were purchased from Folkmanis. Two years later, the network allegedly switched to a Chinese manufacturer to supply the replica hippos, along with key chains, slippers and T-shirts bearing the stuffed animal’s likeness. ####  ##### Currently, all Bert the Farting Hippo merchandise has since been removed from the network’s online store. ####  ##### In its lawsuit, Folkmanis says the merchandise violates its copyright on the design of the original hippo. The company is seeking at least $733,000 in damages, which it says is roughly equivalent to CBS’ profits from the sale of the merchandise, plus an injunction barring the network from further sales of products bearing the contested design. ####  ##### In the meantime, there’s no word on whether the dispute will lead to an untimely “N.C.I.S.” ending for the flatulent Bert. #### "
"Philip Morris ordered to defend fraud suit over U.S. military vendors";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit against Philip Morris USA Inc. that claims the tobacco company defrauded the federal government by failing to sell cigarettes to military vendors at the lowest price. ####  ##### The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that a lower court judge should not have dismissed the lawsuit by Anthony Oliver, the president and CEO of Medallion Brands International Co., another cigarette company. ####  ##### The 2008 lawsuit against Philip Morris, an Altria Group Inc. company, concerns cigarette sales to the Navy Exchange Service Command and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, both of which operate facilities that sell products to military personnel and their families. ####  ##### Mr. Oliver said Philip Morris sold cigarettes to its affiliates at lower rates than those the government paid. The lawsuit claimed Philip Morris charged millions of dollars more each year than it should have. ####  ##### Philip Morris said in court papers that Mr. Oliver is simply a competitor who also sells cigarettes to the military and has “no inside information” about the claims. ####  ##### In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the lawsuit could proceed because the information on which it was based was not, as the lower court found, already publicly disclosed. ####  ##### The False Claims Act allows citizens, as well as the government, to bring claims. If they win, they receive a percentage of the damages. Lawsuits cannot be based on information that is already public. #### "

"Judge casts doubt on Hewlett-Packard shareholder settlement in Autonomy lawsuit";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. judge cast doubt on Monday over a proposed agreement struck between Hewlett-Packard Co. and plaintiff shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the computing giant's botched acquisition of Autonomy P.L.C. ####  ##### At a hearing Monday in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the settlement contained a ""potentially fatal"" provision, under which HP would hire shareholder attorneys to pursue claims against ex-Autonomy executives. He said that provision may prevent his approving the deal. ####  ##### Judge Breyer said he would not approve the proposed fees for shareholder lawyers. ####  ##### ""That's out,"" he said. Additionally, Judge Breyer said that in order to approve the remainder of the deal, the judge may have to conduct a separate inquiry into the merits of dismissing claims against HP officers, including current Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman. ####  ##### HP announced a $8.8 billion writedown in November 2012, just over one year after buying Autonomy, and linked more than $5 billion to accounting fraud and inflated financials by Autonomy executives. The British company and its executives have denied any wrongdoing. ####  ##### Under the terms of the settlement reached in June, shareholder attorneys agreed to drop all claims against HP's current and former executives, including Whitman, board members and advisers to the company. ####  ##### HP, in turn, agreed to team up with the shareholder attorneys to bring claims against former Autonomy executives, including Chief Executive Michael Lynch. The shareholder attorneys stand to recoup millions in fees. ####  ##### Multiple parties objected to the deal. Former Autonomy Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain said in a court filing that the ""collusive and unfair"" settlement, if approved by Judge Breyer, would let HP ""forever bury from disclosure the real reason for its 2012 writedown of Autonomy: HP's own destruction of Autonomy's success after the acquisition."" ####  ##### The case is In re: Hewlett-Packard Co.

Domino's Pizza L.L.C. et al. involved a former employee of a Domino's Pizza franchisee, who sued the franchisor, a unit of Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan-based Domino's Pizza, along with the alleged harasser and the franchisee, for the sexual harassment she allegedly suffered from the harasser, who was a manager of the franchise where she worked. ####  ##### Ms. Patterson had claimed that because Domino's was the “employer” of persons working for the franchisee and the franchisee was a Domino's agent, Domino's could be held vicariously liable for the harasser's actions. ####  ##### The Ventura County, California, Superior Court trial court granted Domino's summary judgment dismissing the case, holding that Domino's did not control the franchisee's day-to-day operations. ####  ##### However, applying the same basic principles, the state appeals court in Ventura, California, reversed that ruling, holding that a “reasonable inference could be drawn” from the franchisee's contract with Domino's and its manager's reference guide, that the franchisee, Thousand Oaks California-based Sui Juris L.L.C., “lacked managerial independence.” ####  ##### In reversing the appellate court ruling, the state Supreme Court in San Francisco held in last week's 4-3 ruling that nothing in the franchisor-franchisee contract “granted Domino's any of the functions commonly performed by employers. All such rights and duties were allocated to Sui Juris,” including recruiting, hiring, training, scheduling for work, supervising, and paying employees.” ####  ##### Thus, “Domino's had no right or duty to control employment or personnel matters for Sui Juris,” said the majority opinion, in reversing the state appellate court ruling. ####  ##### The minority opinion held that “the majority places too much emphasis on the terms of the franchise agreement and not enough on the parties' real-world interaction.” ####  ##### The issue of the franchisor-franchisee relationship has recently attracted attention in light of a determination by the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel that McDonald's Corp. subsidiary Warrenville, Illinois-based McDonald's USA L.L.C., should be considered a “joint employer” with its franchisees, which could dramatically increase franchisors' potential liabilities should it become law. #### "
"Title IX class action lawsuit ruling against California school district upheld on appeal ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A federal appellate court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of female high school athletes in a Chula Vista, California-based school district charging violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal civil rights law that prohibits gender discrimination in education. ####  ##### In a ruling in Veronica Ollier et al. v. Sweetwater Union High School District et al., a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco also upheld the lower court ruling that the school district had engaged in unlawful retaliation under Title IX when it fired its girls' softball coach. ####  ##### It upheld the district court's granting of injunctive relief on both issues. ####  ##### In litigation first filed in April 2007, the U.S. District Court in Pasadena, California, concluded Sweetwater violated Title IX by failing to provide equal treatment and benefits to female athletes at Castle Park High School in Chula Vista in nine different areas, including recruiting, training, equipment, scheduling and fundraising, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In its March 2009 ruling, the District Court also found that female students “were supervised by overworked coaches, provided with inferior competition and practice facilities, and received less publicity than male athletes.” ####  ##### “We conclude that Sweetwater has not fully and effectively accommodated the interests and abilities of its female athletes,” said the appellate panel, in affirming the lower court ruling. ####  ##### The appellate court also agreed with the District Court that the school district had engaged in retaliation in firing the girls' softball coach, Chris Martinez, after the father of two of the named plaintiffs complained to school administrators about inequalities for girls in the school's athletic programs. ####  ##### The school district found that Mr. Martinez was fired six weeks after the school's athletic director told him “he could be fired at any time for any reason — a comment the coach understood to be a threat he would be fired” if more complaints were made about the girls' softball facilities, said the ruling. ####  ##### “Coach Martinez gave softball players extra practice time and individualized attention, persuaded volunteer coaches to help with specialized skills, and arranged for the team to play in tournaments attended by college recruiters. The softball team was stronger with Coach Martinez than without him,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “Plaintiffs have alleged judicially cognizable injuries flowing from Sweetwater's retaliatory responses to Title IX complaints made by their parents and Coach Martinez,” said the panel, in affirming the lower court's ruling. #### "
"Bank of Montreal is sued over Tom Petters' Ponzi scheme";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — Bank of Montreal was sued Thursday by a trustee liquidating two Florida funds that claimed to have lost money in a Ponzi scheme operated by Minnesota businessman Thomas Petters. ####  ##### The lawsuit seeks to recoup $23.6 billion, more than six times the estimated $3.65 billion size of Mr. Petters' fraud, based on sums transferred by Mr. Petters over five years to an account at Marshall & Ilsley Bank, which Bank of Montreal now owns. ####  ##### ""There is no merit to these claims and we will defend ourselves vigorously,"" Carey Allen, a spokeswoman for Bank of Montreal's BMO Harris Bank unit, said in an emailed statement. ####  ##### The case was brought by Barry Mukamal, a trustee liquidating two funds known as Palm Beach Finance. ####  ##### These funds filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2009, just over a year after Mr. Petters' fraud was uncovered and his businesses were put into receivership. ####  ##### Thursday's lawsuit was filed with the U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, nearly six years after Mr. Petters' offices were raided by the FBI in September 2008. ####  ##### Mr. Petters, now 57, was convicted in December 2009 on all 20 criminal counts he faced, including fraud and money laundering, and is serving a 50-year prison term. ####  ##### Prosecutors accused him of using one of his companies to bilk investors who thought he was using their money to buy consumer electronics for resale to retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp. and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. ####  ##### In his lawsuit, Mr. Mukamal said Marshall & Ilsley Bank knew the ""astronomical"" activity in Mr. Petters' account bore no relationship to Mr. Petters' alleged business and that Mr. Petters was involved in money laundering on an ""unprecedented scale."" ####  ##### But he said the Milwaukee-based bank did nothing, hoping instead to expand its ""important"" and ""substantial"" relationship with Mr. Petters. The trustee also said Marshall & Ilsley did not use good faith in handling money flows. ####  ##### Bank of Montreal bought Marshall & Ilsley in 2011. ####  ##### Florida lies within the 11th federal judicial circuit, which also includes Alabama and Georgia. ####  ##### In 2010, the federal appeals court in that circuit said an initial recipient of a debtor's fraudulently transferred funds can avoid liability for the transfer if it served merely as a ""conduit"" for the debtor, was an ""innocent participant"" in the transfer, and acted in good faith. ####  ##### ""Tom Petters ran the third-largest financial fraud in United States history through a single bank account at M&I Bank,"" the trustee's lawyer Solomon Genet said. ""We look forward to proceeding before a Florida jury."" ####  ##### The case is Mukamal v. BMO Harris Bank NA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No. 14-01660. #### "
"JPMorgan Chase replaces some credit cards after Home Depot breach";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. is replacing some credit and debit cards following the security breach at Home Depot Inc., a company spokesman said. ####  ##### The company began sending notices Tuesday to some card holders, advising them that they will soon receive new cards because the breach put them ""at risk."" ####  ##### One of the notices said the company would mail a new card on Sept. 30. The existing card can be used in the meantime, but the notice advised monitoring the account for unrecognized purchases. ####  ##### JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick could not immediately say how many cards are likely to be replaced. ####  ##### Home Depot disclosed on Sept. 8 that its payment security systems had been breached. The company is investigating how much account data might have been taken as customers paid for purchases in the United States and Canada from April through August. ####  ##### The spokesman could not immediately say why the bank moved now to replace the cards or discuss how it balanced the goals of thwarting fraud and minimizing inconvenience to customers. ####  ##### After card data was taken from Target Corp. stores in December, JPMorgan quickly canceled some debit cards that were threatened and asked customers to go to branches for replacements. ####  ##### JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and one of the biggest card issuers. It issues cards under its Chase brand and under co-branding relationships with some airlines and hotel chains, such as United, Southwest and Marriott. ####  ##### The notice to card holders said customers will not be liable for unauthorized transactions that they report promptly to the company. The company said it would continue to monitor accounts to help identify unusual activity. ####  ##### After confirming the breach, Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially affected customers. ####  ##### The retailer had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year to prevent card fraud. ####  ##### Brian Krebs, who runs the security website KrebsOnSecurity and first reported the Home Depot breach, said earlier this month that it could be larger than the attack on Target in which hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data during that retailer's busiest season. ####  ##### Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of the expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks. ####  ##### The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos. Inc., operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months. #### "

A company spokeswoman said Wednesday in an email the A&E business was previously led by Houston-based Corinne Nunley, who is now focusing on Shinnerer’s energy program. ####  ##### Mr. Thomas is taking over the international business from Chevy Chase-based Steve Cohen, who is now focused on running the company’s management liability programs, the spokeswoman said. ####  ##### Mr. Thomas comes to Schinnerer from American International Group Inc., where he served as a regional casualty executive. #### "
"Merry Maids franchisee settles EEOC pregnancy bias suit for $40,000";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A Wisconsin Merry Maids franchisee has agreed to pay $40,000 to settle an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission pregnancy discrimination lawsuit, the agency said. ####  ##### Kenosha, Wisconsin-based V&B L.L.C., a franchisee of Merry Maids, which is a unit of Memphis, Tennessee-based ServiceMaster Co., was charged with firing Belinda Sternemann in 2011 because she suffered from pregnancy-related issues, the EEOC said Tuesday in a statement. ####  ##### Ms. Sternemann, a military veteran who had worked for V&B for more than two years, was a team captain on one of V&B’s crews and had an unblemished work record, the EEOC said in its statement. The agency said her pregnancy issues were alleged to be minor and did not prevent her from working. ####  ##### The settlement agreement provides that in addition to paying Ms. Sternemann the $40,000, the company will train its managers regarding employee rights and employers’ obligations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “Sometimes employers overreact and base employment decisions on an employee’s pregnancy,” said EEOC Chicago regional attorney John C. Hendrickson, in the statement. “Federal law assures pregnant women that they have the same right as other people to earn a living.” ####  ##### “The ADA requires employers to engage in discussions with employees they believe to be disabled before taking any action which would affect their employment rights. We’re pleased that the consent decree in this case provides fair compensation to Ms. Sternemann for the violation of her rights and includes terms which should preclude similar problems in the future,” Mr. Hendrickson said. ####  ##### The company’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### The EEOC’s issuance in July of updated guidance for pregnancy discrimination has generated controversy as legal experts debate the scope and timing of the new rules. #### "
"Wilson Sonsini tech engineer charged with insider trading";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — An information technology engineer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati was arrested Tuesday and charged with insider trading on information he learned while working at the prominent Silicon Valley law firm. ####  ##### Dimitry Braverman, 41, was charged with one count of securities fraud in a criminal complaint filed in New York. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil lawsuit. ####  ##### Authorities said Mr. Braverman from 2010 to 2013 made close to $300,000 from illegal trades in stocks and options of eight companies, including Drugstore.com Inc., Dealertrack Technologies Inc. and Seagate Technology P.L.C., involved in transactions on which Wilson Sonsini was providing legal advice. ####  ##### Prosecutors said the scheme stopped for 1½ years in April 2011 after Wilson Sonsini associate Matthew Kluger was arrested in a separate insider trading scheme and prosecuted in New Jersey. ####  ##### Yet they said Mr. Braverman resumed his scheme, using a brokerage account in the name of a relative in Russia, after Mr. Kluger was sentenced in June 2012 to a record 12 years in prison. ####  ##### Authorities said Mr. Braverman had access to nonpublic information about the transactions through his job maintaining and designing software for Wilson Sonsini's finance operations. ####  ##### Courtney Dorman, a Wilson Sonsini spokeswoman, called the case ""deeply disturbing to say the least."" She also said the firm put Mr. Braverman on unpaid administrative leave upon learning about the arrest and is cooperating with authorities. ####  ##### ""Client confidentiality is at the center of all we do, and we have strict policies and internal controls established to protect it,"" Ms. Dorman said in a statement. ####  ##### Wilson Sonsini has offices in Palo Alto, California, and more than a dozen other locations. ####  ##### A lawyer for Mr. Braverman could not immediately be identified. The defendant is identified as Dmitry Braverman in the criminal complaint, and Dimitry by the SEC and Wilson Sonsini. ####  ##### According to the criminal complaint, Mr. Braverman also tipped another person who engaged in two of the suspect trades. The SEC lawsuit said that person was his brother. ####  ##### The case marked the latest in a string of insider trading prosecutions under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has secured convictions of 81 people since October 2009. ####  ##### According to court documents, Wilson Sonsini's general counsel emailed employees after Mr. Kluger's arrest to remind them of the firm's policies on insider trading. ####  ##### But authorities said Mr. Braverman in November 2012 opened the new brokerage account in the name of his relative, Vitaly Pupynin, and resumed his scheme, conducting at least four more illegal trades through December 2013. ####  ##### The SEC named Mr. Pupynin as a relief defendant to recover alleged illegal gains held in the brokerage account. A lawyer for Mr. Pupynin could not be immediately located. ####  ##### The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v. Braverman, No. 14-mj-02031, and SEC v.

"Chesapeake Energy to face racketeering charges in Michigan trial";"Risk Management";"Energy";" ##### (Reuters) — Natural gas and oil producer Chesapeake Energy Corp. must face trial on charges of felony racketeering and using false pretenses related to its land-leasing practices, a state judge has ruled. ####  ##### Cheboygan District Court Judge Maria Barton ruled on Monday that Oklahoma-based Chesapeake go to trial on one charge of racketeering and 20 counts of using false pretenses to allegedly defraud private landowners in the state during an oil and gas leasing boom in 2010. Barton ruled after a hearing last month. No trial date has been set. ####  ##### State Attorney General Bill Schuette brought the charges against Chesapeake in June, alleging the company directed its leasing agents to lock up land positions in the state by offering signing bonuses to private landowners. ####  ##### Later, when Chesapeake's competitors in the region slowed down their leasing, Chesapeake's agents allegedly canceled the deals, claiming that mortgages on the properties were grounds for not honoring the deals after earlier assurances that would not be an issue. ####  ##### As a result, Chesapeake obtained “uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land,” the state charged. ####  ##### In a statement, Chesapeake said it believes the charges are without merit and expects to prevail at trial. ####  ##### “We continue to believe the Attorney General is attempting to criminalize basic contract disputes,” said company spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. “Chesapeake remains focused on moving past these legacy issues from 2010 and executing our business strategies to drive profitable growth.” ####  ##### The criminal charges against Chesapeake followed a 2011 investigation by Reuters into the company's land-leasing tactics during a speculative leasing boom in the northern part of the state during 2010, including its use of a shell company to cancel land deals with more than 800 private landowners. ####  ##### Chesapeake, which was then led by CEO Aubrey McClendon who later left the company amid allegations of mismanagement, has denied wrongdoing. ####  ##### Mr. Schuette's office said the racketeering charge is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. The 20 counts of using false pretenses are punishable by fines of $10,000 for each count, or triple the value of the money or property involved, whichever is greater. ####  ##### Chesapeake will also go on trial in Michigan on antitrust charges for its alleged role in bid-rigging at a state land auction in 2010, following an earlier ruling by Judge Barton in July. ####  ##### In that case, Chesapeake is charged with colluding with a competitor, Encana Corp., to suppress land lease values in the state in 2010. ####  ##### Michigan officials began looking into their activities in 2012 after a Reuters investigation found that executives from the two companies discussed proposals to divide bidding responsibilities in a state land auction and in deals with several private landowners. Chesapeake has denied any wrongdoing. #### "

"New 'Bash' software bug may pose bigger threat than 'Heartbleed'";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Tech Insights";" ##### (Reuters) — A newly discovered security bug in a widely used piece of Linux software, known as “Bash,” could pose a bigger threat to computer users than the “Heartbleed” bug that surfaced in April, cyber experts warned on Wednesday. ####  ##### Bash is the software used to control the command prompt on many Unix computers. Hackers can exploit a bug in Bash to take complete control of a targeted system, security experts said. ####  ##### The Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or US-CERT, issued an alert saying the vulnerability affected Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X. ####  ##### The “Heartbleed” bug allowed hackers to spy on computers but not take control of them, according to Dan Guido, chief executive of a cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits. ####  ##### “The method of exploiting this issue is also far simpler. You can just cut and paste a line of code and get good results.” ####  ##### Tod Beardsley, an engineering manager at cybersecurity firm Rapid7, warned the bug was rated a “10” for severity, meaning it has maximum impact, and rated “low” for complexity of exploitation, meaning it is relatively easy for hackers to launch attacks. ####  ##### “Using this vulnerability, attackers can potentially take over the operating system, access confidential information, make changes, et cetera,” Mr. Beardsley said. “Anybody with systems using Bash needs to deploy the patch immediately.” ####  ##### US-CERT advised computer users to obtain operating systems updates from software makers. It said that Linux providers including Red Hat Inc. had already prepared them, but it did not mention an update for OS X. Apple representatives could not be reached. ####  ##### Tavis Ormandy, a Google Inc. security researcher, said via Twitter that the patches seemed “incomplete.” Ormandy could not be reached to elaborate, but several security experts said a brief technical comment provided on Twitter raised concerns. ####  ##### “That means some systems could be exploited even though they are patched,” said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer with security software maker Veracode. ####  ##### He said corporate security teams had spent the day combing their networks to find vulnerable machines and patch them, and they would likely be taking other precautions to mitigate the potential for attacks in case the patches proved ineffective. ####  ##### “Everybody is scrambling to patch all of their Internet-facing Linux machines. That is what we did at Veracode today,” he said. “It could take a long time to get that done for very large organizations with complex networks.” ####  ##### “Heartbleed,” discovered in April, is a bug in an open-source encryption software called OpenSSL. The bug put the data of millions of people at risk as OpenSSL is used in about two-thirds of all websites. It also forced dozens of technology companies to issue security patches for hundreds of products that use OpenSSL. ####  ##### Bash is a shell, or command prompt software, produced by the non-profit Free Software Foundation. Officials with that group could not be reached for comment. #### "
"Barclays takes $77M hit from British and U.S. fines";"Risk Management";"United Kingdom";" ##### (Reuters) — British bank Barclays P.L.C. was hit with a combined $77 million in fines from British and U.S. regulators on Tuesday as the lender continues to be dogged by problems from its past. ####  ##### Barclays was fined £38 million ($61.9 million) by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority for exposing customers to unnecessary risks by failing to ensure that client assets were properly safeguarded and adequate records kept. ####  ##### Hours later, it was hit with a $15 million fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for lax internal compliance processes after its takeover of the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. ####  ##### The SEC said Barclays will be required to undertake certain remedial steps, including the hiring of an independent compliance consultant. ####  ##### The U.S. regulator said Barclays failed to enhance its compliance program when it bought Lehman's advisory business after the U.S. bank's collapse. The shortcomings, the SEC said, led Barclays to commit a variety of other violations of federal laws governing investment advisers. ####  ##### It said the violations resulted in overcharging and client losses of approximately $472,000 and additional revenue to Barclays of more than $3.1 million. The bank has since reimbursed or credited affected clients about $3.8 million, the SEC said. ####  ##### Barclays is trying to improve standards and its corporate culture after being rocked by a series of scandals — including the mis-selling of loan insurance and the attempted manipulation of Libor interest rates — which raised concern about lax standards. ####  ##### Earlier on Tuesday, the FCA imposed its highest fine for client asset breaches and said there were ""significant weaknesses"" in Barclays' systems and controls between November 2007 and January 2012 that put £16.5 billion ($26.88 billion) of client assets at risk. ####  ##### The FCA, which has tightened rules governing client asset protection since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, said that customers risked incurring extra costs, lengthy delays or losing their assets if the bank had become insolvent. ####  ##### ""Barclays failed to apply the lessons from our previous enforcement actions, numerous industrywide warnings and exposed its clients to unnecessary risk,"" said Tracey McDermott, the head of enforcement and financial crime at the FCA. ####  ##### ""All firms should be clear after Lehman that there is no excuse for failing to safeguard client assets."" ####  ##### Barclays, which said it did not profit from these failings and that no customer had lost money, qualified for a 30% fine reduction because it cooperated with the FCA. This reduced the penalty from an original £54 million ($88 million). ####  ##### ""Barclays identified and self-reported to the FCA the issues giving rise to the FCA's findings and we accept their conclusion,"" the bank said in an emailed statement. ""Barclays has subsequently enhanced its systems to resolve these issues and to ensure we have the requisite processes in place."" ####  ##### Barclays said the SEC's action related to activity between 2009 and 2011 and it had since strengthened its supervisory and control environment. #### "

"SEC announces $30M payout in largest whistleblower award";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — An anonymous tipster living abroad will receive $30 million in the largest whistleblower award ever doled out by U.S. securities regulators as part of a program that aims to encourage insiders to report wrongdoing. ####  ##### The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that the whistleblower provided crucial information that helped investigators uncover a “difficult to detect” ongoing fraud. ####  ##### “This record-breaking award sends a strong message about our commitment to whistleblowers and the value they bring to law enforcement,” SEC Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney said. ####  ##### The SEC won new powers in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to entice whistleblowers with monetary awards. Prior to the new law, the SEC was only able to reward people for helping on insider-trading cases. ####  ##### The new program lets the SEC pay a whistleblower who provides tips and original information that leads to an enforcement action with sanctions that exceed $1 million. ####  ##### The SEC can award a whistleblower anywhere between 10% and 30% of the money the agency collects. ####  ##### By law, the SEC is not allowed to reveal the identity of whistleblowers, and so as a result it does not disclose which case a whistleblower helped to crack. ####  ##### Settlements with the SEC large enough to justify a $30 million award are uncommon. ####  ##### Monday's announcement marks the fourth time the SEC has agreed to award a whistleblower living abroad — a fact that the agency said demonstrates the “international breadth” of the program. ####  ##### Since the inception of the program in fiscal year 2012, the SEC has awarded more than a dozen whistleblowers. Monday's $30 million award is more than double the previous record of $14 million, awarded to a whistleblower in 2013. #### "
"Sheplers western wear stores reveal data breach ";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Western wear retail chain Sheplers said it has experienced a data breach in which hackers gained access to its systems and some of its customers' payment card information over almost a three-month period that ended earlier this month. ####  ##### A company spokeswoman said Monday that at this point the company is aware of “a few dozen” customers who have reported fraud. She said the retailer does not have cyber insurance. ####  ##### Wichita, Kansas-based Sheplers, which has 21 stores in eight states, said in its announcement Friday that the breach potentially affects customers who used payment cards at its retail locations between June 11 and Sept. 4, 2014. It said the information at risk includes names, account numbers for both credit cards and debit cards, and card expiration dates. ####  ##### The retailer said it has found no evidence that debit card PINs have been compromised, and it does not believe that social security numbers, which are not stored on payment cards, could have been accessed. ####  ##### The company said it first learned about the breach from an informal tip from a financial institution, which was later confirmed by an investigation. “We have implemented new security measures, and we resumed processing credit cards in our stores only after determining that it was safe to do so,” said the retailer, which is offering its clients a credit monitoring service. ####  ##### It is also encouraging its customers to review their credit and debit card statements for evidence of unauthorized charges. #### "
"DSW to pay $900K to settle case of age bias in layoffs";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### DSW Inc., formerly known as Designer Shoe Warehouse, has agreed to pay $900,000 to settle an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission age discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with firing employees over the age of 40 years old during a reduction in force, the agency said Monday. ####  ##### The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer denied the charges in a statement, and said it settled the case to reduce litigation expenses. ####  ##### The EEOC said DSW had violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and discriminated against seven former management employees in its Midwest region, and a class of former employees, by terminating older employees because of their age, and retaliating against certain employees who had opposed the orders to discriminate. The EEOC said its complaint covered DSW field personnel in its Midwest region as well as corporate home office employees. ####  ##### The EEOC said its lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Sept. 15, and DSW decided to immediately negotiate the settlement. The consent decree settling the case was filed with the court Friday. ####  ##### In addition to providing $900,000 in monetary relief to the alleged victims, the settlement requires DSW to report to the EEOC for the next three years all employee complaints of age discrimination arising out of the regions covered by the decree, the agency said. ####  ##### The company is also required to train all its employees in these locations on the prevention and eradication of age discrimination and revise its antidiscrimination policy, the EEOC said. ####  ##### John Hendrickson, the EEOC’s regional attorney in Chicago, said in a statement, “We’re pleased that DSW worked to resolve this suit so quickly, without the need to go through expensive and time-consuming litigation. ####  ##### “Instead, DSW chose to focus on making changes in its workplace and compensating victims. As a result, the day when those put out of work are compensated and the day when DSW is able to again focus 100% on its business will be here sooner rather than later.” ####  ##### DSW said in an emailed statement, “DSW unequivocally denies the claims made by the EEOC. The EEOC’s allegations focus on employee separations during 2008 and 2009. Those difficult decisions were driven by economic volatility and were in no way influenced by the age of associates. Our decision to settle this case mitigates the costs associated with a lengthy legal proceeding and is in the best interest of our associates and shareholders. ####  ##### “Additionally, the company is directing any unclaimed benefits from the settlement to a selected non-profit organization that provides job placement and training services to the local community [of Chicago].” #### "

Unfortunately, cyber-criminals are finding new ways to infiltrate data systems every day, leaving companies increasingly vulnerable to these kinds of events. Our team is working around-the-clock to fully assess the situation and determine whether any personal information could be at risk.

At Wells Fargo, we value our team members' diversity. We are committed to building and sustaining a diverse and inclusive culture for all Wells Fargo team members and have zero tolerance for any form of discrimination.” ####  ##### The EEOC also said Wednesday that Prestige Transportation Service L.L.C., a Miami company that provides transportation services to airline personnel to and from Miami International Airport, will pay $200,000 to settle a race discrimination and retaliation lawsuit, in connection with actions allegedly committed under different ownership. ####  ##### The EEOC charged in its suit that Prestige’s predecessor company, Airbus Alliance Inc., repeatedly instructed its human resource manager to not hire African-American applicants because they were “trouble” and “would sue the company.” ####  ##### Its owners also used a derogatory term for one employee and fired her after she filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, the agency said. The EEOC said also Airbus terminated its human resources manager and another employee once they opposed the company’s discriminatory practices. ####  ##### Payments will be made to three named claimants as well as a class of black applicants for employment under the settlement agreement. In addition, the company has agreed to several additional measures, including implementing numerical goals for hiring black applicants, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “We are pleased that Prestige — under its new ownership — worked with the EEOC in reaching this important settlement,” said Robert E.

"New PCI chairman monitors federal regulatory posture";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers";" ##### For Terrence W. Cavanaugh, a challenge facing the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America is continuing to provide effective advocacy for its members and the industry in a rapidly evolving risk landscape. ####  ##### That means commercial and personal lines insurers alike, said Mr. Cavanaugh, who assumed the PCI chairmanship Tuesday during this year’s annual conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. ####  ##### “Our challenge is to make sure we have the right talent and the right place to have the right discussion to promote our industry,” the president and CEO of Erie, Pennsylvania-based Erie Insurance Group said. ####  ##### “We want to make sure that we protect the economy from terrorism,” whether it stems from domestic and/or foreign sources, he said. Not surprisingly, the reauthorization of the federal government’s terrorism insurance backstop program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 “is a big issue for us,” he said. ####  ##### The program will lapse on Dec. 31 unless Congress reauthorizes it. The Senate has passed a measure that would extend the program for seven years, but the full House has yet to move on a bill approved by the House Financial Services Committee that would extend the program for only five years, as well as make other changes to the program. ####  ##### The bills differ in other ways. Advocates of the program hope that differences will be resolved and that both houses will approve an extension during next month’s lame-duck session. ####  ##### Another issue facing PCI is “the evolving role of the federal government in our business,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. PCI is trying to make sure that any federal role works for the industry and the consumer. He said the trade group seeks to assure that any federal role in the traditionally state-based regulation of insurance is “appropriate” and “promotes a sound private insurance industry.” ####  ##### “If we’re an effective advocacy organization,” PCI will grow and increase its influence, he said. Mr. Cavanaugh cited looking at issues such as the proper regulation of the commercial ride-sharing industry as an example. To be an effective trade organization, PCI works to make sure that it’s a credible source of information for the industry, regulators and to some extent consumers, too. ####  ##### Looking to the future, Mr. Cavanaugh said that the industry must draw talented young people to its ranks. “We sell an intangible that is sometimes difficult for new entrants in the business to comprehend,” he said. ####  ##### He said that when he talks to college students and other candidates, he talks about the “diversity of jobs available,” and stresses that “we’re the glue and the grease of the economy.” ####  ##### “By virtue of our balance sheets and risk transfer, we allow the organizations to remain stable,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. “Nothing happens without risk transfer. We’ve got to get that story out.” #### "
"Dallas company to pay $499,000 for sexual harassment, retaliation firings";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A six-person jury for the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, has awarded three former employees of a Dallas-based physician services provider nearly $500,000 in a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency said Monday. ####  ##### Gloria Stokes, a former executive assistant for EmCare Holdings Inc., was awarded $250,000 in punitive damages based on the claim that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor, division CEO Jim McKinney, according to a statement by the EEOC. ####  ##### Meanwhile, credentialer Bonnie Shaw and recruiter Luke Trahan, were awarded $82,000 and $167,000, respectively, for retaliatory discharge, according to the statement released after Friday's decision. ####  ##### Ms. Shaw and Mr. Trahan, who worked in the AnesthesiaCare Division of EmCare, said they told human resources personnel that Mr. McKinney made an inappropriate remark to Ms. Shaw's daughter, who was 15 years old at the time, during a Bring Your Child to Work Day event, according to the statement. Both Ms. Shaw and Mr. Trahan were fired six weeks later for “performance issues.” ####  ##### “Ms. Stokes, Ms. Shaw, and Mr. Trahan spent their time at EmCare working diligently to do their jobs well despite the pervasive sexual environment that human resources allowed Jim McKinney to create and perpetuate,” EEOC senior trial attorney Meaghan Shepard said in the statement. “Their complaints were ignored, and instead of getting support from HR, Ms. Shaw and Mr. Trahan were fired for daring to speak out against the division CEO. By today's verdict, it is clear that all three have finally been heard.” #### "
"Outgoing chairman proud of PCI's thought leadership";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### The Property Casualty Insurers Association of America is in great shape as he makes an exit, outgoing Chairman Robert Restrepo said. ####  ##### Mr. Restrepo, who is chairman, CEO and president of State Auto Insurance Cos. of Columbus, Ohio, said that's because PCI President David Sampson has “recruited and developed a terrific staff,” which has allowed the group to be a thought leader in the industry. ####  ##### That's been particularly important during the year of Mr. Restrepo's chairmanship. Working toward PCI's top priority — reauthorization of the federal terrorism insurance program created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 — has not been easy. Congress has yet to renew the program, which is slated to expire on Dec. 31, but appears likely to vote on the issue during next month's lame-duck session. ####  ##### “We would have preferred to have the bill passed and signed earlier,” Mr. Restrepo said. There is a “great need for the type of security TRIA will provide,” he said, adding that he's reasonably confident it will be renewed before the end of the year. ####  ##### He said PCI has been able to provide information to senators and congressmen regarding what would happen if TRIA were not passed by Congress. ####  ##### “I'm very proud of the association being a thought leader in providing information,” he said. ####  ##### Another issue that has continued to evolve this year is global regulatory convergence. “As an industry, we used to be concerned about Washington” becoming more involved in insurance regulation, he said. Now the issue is international regulation, he said. ####  ##### PCI has been trying to educate regulators about why the state-based regulatory system is best. “Why would we want to adopt what we think is a bank-centric regulatory system when the current system is working fine?” Mr. Restrepo said. ####  ##### PCI also has had to respond to economic developments such as the emergence of commercial ride-sharing ventures, he said. The result has been the creation of what he calls “real gaps in insurance coverage for both the folks who are driving as part of this transportation network, as well as people riding,” he said. PCI has been “very aggressive” in working with regulators and legislators about confronting the risks involved, Mr. Restrepo said. ####  ##### “To a large degree PCI's challenges reflect the challenges of its members,” he said. “The rate of change has accelerated on all fronts.” ####  ##### In addition to regulatory trends, insurers must deal with a changing workforce. ####  ##### The property/casualty insurance industry is “going to lose hundreds of thousands of people over the next five to 10 years,” he said. ####  ##### Recruiting is a challenge for all of PCI's members, Mr. Restrepo said, and he sees the industry group continuing to provide role models and information to a new generation of professionals entering the industry. #### "
"Terrorism backstop extension, financial regulations top PCI agenda";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Terrorism";" ##### Securing an extension of the federal terrorism insurance backstop created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 tops the agenda for the Property and Casualty Insurers Association of America, but it’s far from the organization’s sole concern. ####  ##### The insurer trade group has considerably more on its plate, including regulatory issues and unforeseen aspects of emerging ride-sharing businesses, PCI President David Sampson said. ####  ##### “The most important priority for the remainder of 2014 is to secure the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which expires Dec. 31,” he said. “That has been our top federal legislative priority for this year.” ####  ##### “I don’t think anyone believes that it is in the best interests of the nation or the economy, at a time of significantly heightened international terrorist threats upon the homeland, that this program expire,” Mr. Sampson said. ####  ##### He seemed optimistic that a resolution could be reached. ####  ##### “There’s been a lot of progress throughout the course of the year,” he said, noting that the Senate had approved reauthorization by a 94-3 vote and that the House Financial Services Committee passed a version of the bill this summer. ####  ##### “Every indication we have had from our extensive and ongoing visits with key leaders on the Hill is that everyone recognizes this is a ‘must do’ piece of legislation,” Mr. Sampson said. ####  ##### He pointed to the nearly unanimous nature of the Senate vote. “It’s pretty miraculous when you consider the gridlock and hyper-partisanship in Washington that you could have an overwhelmingly bipartisan support for reauthorization of this federal backstop,” he said. ####  ##### The question now is the “end game,” Mr. Sampson said. “That will be our top priority as we look forward to Congress coming back for the lame-duck session after the (November) election.” ####  ##### Also on the PCI agenda of critical priorities is “the continuing global regulatory convergence that would seek to impose one-size-fits-all bank-centric capital and regulatory standards on the insurance industry,” he said. ####  ##### “This is an issue that has continued to grow over the past year,” Mr. Sampson said, as international regulatory bodies “are becoming more and more opaque and less open in terms of the process by which they make these decisions.” ####  ##### Along the same lines, the organization will continue trying to pare similar efforts made by the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. ####  ##### “There’s been a lot of progress this year on a fix to the Collins Amendment, which imposed bank-centric-type capital standards on insurers as part of the Dodd-Frank Act,” Mr. Sampson said. ####  ##### The emergence of insurance issues related to the evolving U.S. economy, including services such as ride-share startup Uber, also have landed on PCI’s plate. ####  ##### These issues “kind of exploded onto the scene this year” after a tragic fatal accident involving an Uber driver and a young girl in San Francisco on New Year’s Eve 2013, he said. ####  ##### “We have expended very serious effort on that set of issues this year with some very significant developments,” Mr. Sampson said, referring to the passage of a California law that seeks to establish insurance requirements for such ride-share companies. ####  ##### “We hope the California law will become a model law for other states,” he said. #### "
"Insurers fight to bar cyber coverage under commercial general liability policies";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Tech Insights";" ##### Recent legal efforts by insurers to bar cyber coverage under commercial general liability policies signal a new coverage battle between insurers and policyholders as costly data breaches proliferate. ####  ##### In the latest move, a Travelers Cos. unit earlier this month sought a judicial ruling that it is not obligated to provide indemnity coverage and defense costs under its commercial general liability policy for P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. in connection with the restaurant chain's data breach that occurred from October 2013 through June 2014. ####  ##### The Insurance Services Office Inc.'s recent revisions to its standard commercial general liability policy forms exclude cyber coverage. But it will take some time for these forms to become more widely adopted in the market, and there are numerous older policy forms, at least some of which have ambiguous language, experts say. ####  ##### Furthermore, many firms still do not have cyber insurance policies, leaving their commercial general liability policies as possibly the only source of coverage for the exorbitant costs associated with a major data breach. ####  ##### And even for those firms with cyber policies, general liability policies, unlike their cyber counterparts, provide broader coverage, including offering defense costs that are outside the policy limits, experts say. ####  ##### Policyholders' success in obtaining cyber-related coverage under their general liability policies has been mixed. In February, for instance, a New York judge held that Zurich America Insurance Co. is not obligated to cover Sony Corp. of America for litigation related to the 2011 hacking of its PlayStation Network under Sony's general liability policy. ####  ##### Travelers asserts in its court filing that the “property damage” covered in its commercial general liability policy does not include loss or damage to “electronic media and records.” In August, P.F. Chang's disclosed that customer data from credit and debit cards used at 33 of its 211 P.F. Chang's eateries were pilfered. ####  ##### “The track record of companies trying to get coverage under a CGL policy has not worked out too well,” said Scott L. Vernick, a policyholder attorney and a partner with Fox Rothschild L.L.P. in Philadelphia. “The Sony decision was a very troubling decision in this area.” ####  ##### Insurers' position that cyber risks are not covered under general liability policies is based on policy language, as well as their contention it was never their intent to provide the coverage. ####  ##### The Travelers case is a “clear sign that the CGL carriers are extremely protective of their policy trigger,” said Adam Cottini, managing director, insurance and risk management in North America at Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. in New York. ####  ##### General liability insurers generally are not interested in suing their customers, but “this is one of those moments where it's large enough of an issue where Travelers is willing to obviously accept the negative connotation of using their own insured” for the purposes of a larger issues, Mr. Cottini said. ####  ##### “I don't think we're going to see a lot of these cases,” but it is important for insurers to set a precedent on this issue so both clients and policyholders “know where the coverage resides and where it doesn't,” said John Coletti, New York- based chief underwriting officer for cyber and technology at XL Group P.L.C., who stated insurers never intended for commercial general liability policies to cover cyber events. ####  ##### “Obviously, the carriers are going to continue to fight hard to deny coverage under the CGL policies, claiming there's no property damage liability in these types of situations, so it's going to be battleground and a fight, but it's still an important issue that needs to be looked at,” said David E. Weiss, a policyholder attorney with Reed Smith L.L.P. in San Francisco. ####  ##### Mr. Weiss said policyholders' success in obtaining coverage under their general liability policies is going “depend a lot on the facts of individual cases,” whether they can claim there was physical injury to property or loss of use of property. ####  ##### Joshua Gold, a shareholder with policyholder law firm Anderson Kill P.C. in New York, said, “I don't think it's terribly ambiguous to begin with, which is I think most policyholders should have personal injury coverage for a violation of privacy complaint, unless the policy has an express exclusion for a computer hacking incident.” ####  ##### ISO's recent publication of a cyber exclusion “is an indication that the policies are supposed to be read to cover those, otherwise what's the point of the exclusion?” he asked. ####  ##### William Boeck, senior vice president, insurance and claims counsel, for the Lockton Cos., in Kansas City, Missouri, said he advises his clients never to rely on commercial general liability policies for coverage of cyber risks. ####  ##### “I would always prefer that clients have certainty on this issue, and if they rely on their general liability policy to cover cyber risks, the only thing certain is they will have a fight with their insurer over coverage,” he said. He said more policyholders are buying cyber policies “so they have certainty on the issue.” ####  ##### A prudent policyholder should not “just pick one policy and put all their eggs in one basket,” said Kevin Kalinich, Chicago-based global practice leader of cyber risk insurance at Aon Risk Solutions. ####  ##### Policyholders should seek cyber coverage under any applicable policy, which could include property, crime, kidnap and ransom, and professional liability, as well as a specific cyber policy, he said. ####  ##### He added in these cases an issue may arise under the “other insurance clause” on many policies, which states that the particular policy is excess of any other policy in covering the same issue. #### "
"Northrop must face whistleblower anti-missile lawsuit";"Risk Management";"Middle East/Africa";" ##### (Reuters) — A Chicago federal judge on Thursday rejected Northrop Grumman Corp.'s bid to dismiss a lawsuit by a former employee who accused the defense contractor of defrauding the U.S. government in performing a contract to develop a missile defense system for commercial aircraft. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Manish Shah said the employee, Illinois resident Leo Danielides, plausibly alleged that Northrop induced the government in 2006 to award it the third phase of the “Counter-MANPADS” project through false statements, and lied about its performance when seeking periodic payments. ####  ##### The contract ended in 2008, and federal funding for the Counter-MANPADS project was later canceled. Mr. Danielides sued under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on the government's behalf and share in recoveries. ####  ##### Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said the Falls Church, Virginia-based company does not discuss litigation. ####  ##### The Counter-MANPADS project overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was designed to protect civilian airliners from shoulder-fired missiles after a failed attack in 2002 against an Israeli aircraft taking off from Mombasa, Kenya. ####  ##### According to the complaint, Northrop's performance in the project's first two phases was a key factor in its winning the third phase, where it was expected to use its “best efforts” to test the defense system and fix problems. ####  ##### However, according to Mr. Danielides, who said he worked on the project for “many years,” despite being paid more than $62 million in the third phase, Northrop did “virtually nothing” to improve the design and reliability of the system. ####  ##### In letting most of the case go forward, Judge Shah said Mr. Danielides alleged Northrop and the government agreed on a “specific, shared definition” of what “best efforts” meant: completing a task, or spending money in a legitimate effort to complete it. ####  ##### To prevail, Mr. Danielides will need to show Northrop knew what “best efforts” meant, and as a result lied when seeking payments, Judge Shah said. ####  ##### The judge dismissed one claim concerning a $3 million addition to the Counter-MANPADS project, known as Mod 8. ####  ##### “Our client is very pleased by the decision, and looks forward to pursuing the case,” Mr. Danielides' lawyer Michael Behn said in a telephone interview. #### "
"Dialysis firm to pay $350M to settle physician kickback charges";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A national dialysis services provider has agreed to pay $350 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit involving Justice Department charges that it violated the False Claims Act by paying kickbacks to induce physicians to refer patients to its clinics, the DOJ said Wednesday. ####  ##### The department said that between March 2005 and February 2014, Denver-based DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc., which has dialysis centers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, identified physicians or physicians groups that had significant patient populations suffering renal disease and offered them lucrative opportunities to partner with the firm by acquiring, and/or selling, an interest in dialysis clinics to which their patients would be referred for dialysis treatment. ####  ##### In addition, DaVita entered into secondary agreements with the physicians, including ones in which the physician agreed not to compete with the DaVita clinic, and non-disparagement agreements that would have prevented the physicians from referring their patents to other dialysis providers, the department said in its statement. ####  ##### The settlement resolves charges brought in a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act by a former senior financial analyst in DaVita’s mergers and acquisitions department, David Barbetta. His share of the recovery has not yet been determined, the department said. ####  ##### “Companies seeking to boost profits by paying physician kickbacks for patient referrals — as the government contended in this case — undermine impartial medical judgment at the expense of patients and taxpayers,” said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in the statement. ####  ##### The company said in a statement, “ We have worked incredibly hard to get things right, and it is our belief there was no intentional wrongdoing. ####  ##### “We believe this settlement is the right thing for our teammates, partners and shareholders. It allows us to move forward with heightened clarity and transparency, both with regulators and our physician partners. As part of the settlement, we will undo 11 joint venture transactions covering 26 of our 2,119 clinics.” ####  ##### In July, the department announced the $24.5 million settlement of a whistleblower lawsuit with an Alabama health system and physician group, in which they were charged with violating the False Claims Act by paying or receiving kickbacks in connection with claims to the Medicare program. #### "
"OFF BEAT: 'Simpsons' lawsuit claims cartoon imitates 'Goodfellas' character";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### If gangster “Louie” on “The Simpsons” cartoon reminds you of someone, you’re not alone. ####  ##### Actor Frank Sivero is suing Fox Television Studios Inc., claiming they ripped off the character he developed specifically for the films “Goodfellas” and “The Godfather Part II.” ####  ##### In the lawsuit, filed Oct. 21 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mr. Sivero alleges that the Simpsons’ writers overheard him practicing the character in 1989 while they were living in adjacent apartments. ####  ##### “They knew he was developing the character he was to play in the movie ‘Goodfellas’,” the lawsuit asserts. “In fact, they were aware the entire character of ‘Frankie Carbone’ was created and developed by Sivero, who based his character on his own personality.” ####  ##### In the animated television series, “Louie” is second in command to “Fat Tony,” two Mafioso characters who live in The Simpsons’ hometown of Springfield. ####  ##### Mr. Sivero apparently filed his lawsuit after Gracie Films failed to make good on its promise of making a film with him. ####  ##### The suit states that Gracie Films “never intended to make a film with (Mr.) Sivero, and that they were simply studying him further for the character Louie.” ####  ##### In addition to legal fees and injunctive relief, Mr. Sivero is demanding $250 million in actual damages, including $50 million for the use of his likeness without permission, $100 million for “improper interference,” and $100 million in actual and exemplary damages for the misappropriation of his “confidential” idea. #### "
"Appeals court clears Nationwide of age and race bias charges";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, P/C Insurers";" ##### A federal appeals court has overturned a jury verdict and ruled Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. is not liable for age and race discrimination charges in connection with its termination of two sales managers. ####  ##### Both Parker Perret and Melvin Pierre Sr. had worked as sales managers for Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide under the same supervisor, Brian McCulloch, according to Monday’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Parker Perret; Patricia Penn Pierre as executrix of the estate of Melvin Pierre Sr., deceased v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. ####  ##### Mr. McCulloch placed both Mr. Perret and Mr. Pierre on a job coaching plan in November 2009, according to the ruling. In April 2010, Mr. McCulloch notified Mr. Perret that because of his failure to improve in accordance with the coaching plan, he was being placed on a performance improvement plan. Mr. Perret, who testified this was the final stage in Nationwide’s process for terminating employee, resigned in May 2010. ####  ##### Mr. Pierre, who was also placed on an improvement plan around April 2010, almost immediately took medical leave and resigned in July 2010, according to the ruling. ####  ##### The two men filed separate lawsuits that were later combined in U.S. District Court in Sherman, Texas. Mr. Perret claimed age discrimination, while Mr. Pierre, who was black, charged the insurer with both age and race discrimination. Mr. Pierre died after the case was appealed. ####  ##### In a complex resolution, a federal jury found Nationwide had constructively discharged Mr. Perret because of his age and Mr. Pierre because of his age and race. ####  ##### But the court also found that Nationwide proved it would have placed both men on coaching and improvement plans even if it had not considered age or race, which precluded the plaintiffs from receiving monetary damages under Texas law. ####  ##### The District Court denied Nationwide’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, awarded costs to plaintiffs and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees. ####  ##### Both sides appealed the ruling. A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit held there was no evidence to support the two plaintiffs’ discrimination charges. ####  ##### “Plaintiffs contend that Perret and Pierre were pre-selected for termination because of their age and/or race, that Nationwide did not fairly evaluate their compliance with the coaching plans and (improvement plans), and that the result of the coaching plans and (the improvement plan) was intended to be and would inevitably have been termination.” ####  ##### However, said the appeals panel, “There is no evidence of demotion, reassignment, reduction in responsibilities, harassment, or humiliation, and no evidence that any supervisor or manager ever advised plaintiffs to resign or asked them whether they would resign,” said the panel, in reversing the District Court’s denial of Nationwide’s motion for judgment as a matter of law and calling for the case’s dismissal. #### "
"Staples says probing possible payment card data breach";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — Staples Inc. is investigating a possible breach of payment card data and has contacted law enforcement about the matter, making it the latest U.S. retailer to become a possible victim of a cyber attack. ####  ##### ""Staples is in the process of investigating a potential issue involving credit card data and has contacted law enforcement,"" company spokesman Mark Cautela said in a statement late Monday. ####  ##### The office-supply retailer disclosed the investigation after security reporter Brian Krebs reported on his blog Krebsonsecurity.com that several banks have identified a pattern of payment card fraud suggesting that several Staples stores in northeastern United States had succumbed to a data breach. ####  ##### ""We take the protection of customer information very seriously, and are working to resolve the situation,"" Mr. Cautela said. ####  ##### ""If Staples discovers an issue, it is important to note that customers are not responsible for any fraudulent activity on their credit cards that is reported on a timely basis."" ####  ##### Staples did not provide additional details of the data breach. ####  ##### Earlier this month, Sears Holdings Corp. said it was the victim of a cyber attack that likely resulted in the theft of some customer payment cards at its Kmart stores. ####  ##### Restaurant chain Dairy Queen, owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., also said that it may have compromised payment card information of customers across 46 U.S. states.

"FMLA suit of worker fired after returning from leave reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, P/C Insurers";" ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a Family and Medical Leave Act  lawsuit filed by a worker who was fired nine days after returning from FMLA leave, allegedly in part for being about five minutes late for work for a few days. ####  ##### Jeanne Lee Wallner worked as an options trader for 29 years for Louisville, Kentucky-based financial brokerage firm J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons L.L.C., which conducts business as Hilliard Lyons Asset Management, according to Friday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Jeanne Lee Wallner v. J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons L.O.C. dba Hilliard Lyons Asset Management. ####  ##### In June 2009, Ms. Wallner requested FMLA leave to have knee-replacement surgery. Her physician estimated she would be unable to return to work before Oct. 11, 2009, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Wallner's short-term disability insurer, however, calculated her return-to-work date as Sept. 22, 2009. In mid-September, a human resources manager at the firm told Ms. Wallner she was expected to return to work on that date, and Ms. Wallner unsuccessfully tried to explain to her the difference between FMLA leave and short-term disability, according to the ruling. ####  ##### When Ms. Wallner returned to work on Oct. 1, a colleague started keeping track of when she showed up at work and said she had arrived for work about five minutes late for five days. She was terminated nine days after her return, allegedly in part because of her lateness. ####  ##### Ms. Wallner filed suit against Hilliard Lyons in U.S. District Court in Louisville, Kentucky, charging interference and retaliation under the FMLA; the court granted the firm's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### But in a 2-1 ruling, a 6th Circuit panel reinstated the FMLA retaliation charge. “Even though Wallner lacks direct evidence of discrimination, she has presented circumstantial evidence of retaliation sufficient to forestall summary judgment on her claim,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The opinion said “on the evidence presented by Wallner, a reasonable jury could find the decision to terminate Wallner did not depend upon her tardiness alone,” and that it would be reasonable for a jury to infer her leave “generated ill-will toward her” from her direct supervisor and factored into his decision to terminate her, said the court, in remanding the case to the District Court. ####  ##### The panel did agree with the lower court's dismissal of the FMLA interference claim, stating Ms. Wallner has not demonstrated she was denied a statutory benefit to which she was entitled. ####  ##### In July, a federal court in Seattle refused to dismiss an FMLA violation claim by a Boeing Co. employee who was terminated after she attempted to take FMLA leave for her migraines, stating there is evidence the company discriminated against her. #### "

"Dignity Health hospital system settles whistleblower suit for $37M";"Risk Management";"";" ##### The San Francisco-based Dignity Health hospital system has agreed to pay $37 million to settle charges in a whistleblower suit that 13 of its hospitals in California, Nevada and Arizona knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare and Tricare by admitting patients who could have been treated on a less costly outpatient basis, the U.S. Department of Justice said. ####  ##### Dignity Health said in a statement there is “widespread confusion” about federal standards for approving coverage of patient admissions. ####  ##### The whistleblower in the case, former Dignity employee Kathleen Hawkins, will receive about $6.25 million of the settlement total, the Department of Justice said Thursday in a statement. ####  ##### The department charged that between 2006 and 2010, the hospitals billed Medicare and Tricare, which is part of the military health care program, for inpatient care for certain patients who underwent elective cardiovascular procedures, such as implanting stents and pacemakers, in scheduled surgeries when the claims should have been billed as lower-cost outpatient surgeries. ####  ##### The government also charged that from 2000 through 2008, four of the hospitals billed Medicare for beneficiaries undergoing elective kyphoplasty procedures, which are minimally invasive and performed to treat certain spinal compression fractures that also should have been billed as less costly outpatient procedures. ####  ##### In addition, the 13 hospitals were charged with admitting patients for certain common medical diagnoses where admissions as an inpatient were medically unnecessary between 2008 through 2010, the department said. ####  ##### As part of the agreement, Dignity, which was previously known as Catholic Healthcare West, entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General that requires the company to engage in significant compliance efforts over the next five years, the department said. ####  ##### “Charging the government for higher-cost inpatient services that patients do not need wastes the country's vital health care dollars,” said Joyce R. Branda, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, in the statement. “This department will continue its work to stop abuses of the nation's health care resources and to ensure patients receive the most appropriate care.” ####  ##### Dignity, which is the fifth-largest hospital system in the nation with 39 hospitals in three states, according to the Department of Justice, said in a statement that because of the confusion about federal standards for approving coverage of patient admissions, “it is often challenging for physicians to ensure their documentation adequately reflects their decision-making in order to comply with complex regulations when making their best medical judgments. Dignity Health is dedicated to providing compassionate, high-quality and affordable health care to the patients and communities we serve.” #### "
"Target not obligated by law to provide defibrillators in stores: Appeals court";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Target Corp. is not obligated to provide heart defibrillators in its stores, a federal appeals court said after consulting with the California Supreme Court on the issue, though one of its judges said box stores have a “moral obligation” to keep such equipment on hand in case a customer has a heart attack. ####  ##### Mary Ann Verdugo, 49, was shopping in a Pico Rivera, California, Target store in August 2008 when she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and collapsed, according to Michael Verdugo et al. v. Target Corp., filed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. ####  ##### In response to a 911 call, paramedics were dispatched from a nearby fire station, but it took them several minutes to reach the store and a few additional minutes to reach Ms. Verdugo inside the store, by which time it was too late to save her life. The store had no automatic external defibrillator on hand. ####  ##### Ms. Verdugo's brother and mother filed suit against Minneapolis-based Target, charging the retailer breached the duty of care that it owed Ms. Verdugo by failing to have a defibrillator on hand for use in a medical emergency. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Pasadena, California granted Target's motion to dismiss the case, concluding it had no duty to acquire and make available a defibrillator for customers' use. ####  ##### The plaintiffs appealed the ruling to the 9th Circuit, which determined California law did not provide a clear answer to the question of whether Target was required under California law to have a defibrillator in its stores. The appeals court then asked the California Supreme Court to consider the question. ####  ##### In a unanimous ruling in June, the California Supreme Court held that under California law, “Target's common-law duty of care to its customers does not include a duty to acquire and make available” a defibrillator for use in a medical emergency. ####  ##### In its ruling Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit affirmed the U.S. District Court ruling, based on the state Supreme Court's guidance. ####  ##### However, in a separate opinion, Judge Harry Pregerson said he hopes big box stores, including Target, “will, at the very least recognize their moral obligation” to have a heart defibrillator on hand for use in a medical emergency. ####  ##### “Should that not come to pass, I hope that our California legislature takes a hard look at this issue,” he said, observing also that at least one state, Oregon, has enacted a statue that requires big box stores to have a defibrillator on hand. #### "
"Ebola is one of many risk management issues concerning health care executives";"Risk Management";"Workers Comp Coverage";" ##### ANAHEIM, California — Coping with the threat posed by the Ebola virus is one of many risk management issues on the minds of health care executives. ####  ##### “Get a flu shot,” Richard Umbdenstock, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, advised health care risk managers when dealing with the Ebola threat, noting that its initial symptoms resemble the flu. ####  ##### If “there's a textbook case of the value of risk management and risk managers to their health care organization, it's now,” Mr. Umbdenstock said. “It's a particularly challenging and deadly disease that demands a vigilant adherence to protocols,” and no one in a mobile society can risk ignoring it. ####  ##### Health care organizations must do everything they can to protect patients, staff members and the community, he said during the opening keynote address at the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management's annual conference last month in Anaheim, California. ####  ##### The Ebola virus is among emerging threats in the health care industry for which captives can be a useful tool in helping to insure and manage the risks, others said during the conference. ####  ##### Sarah Pacini, vice president of risk management and insurance at Advocate Health Care in Downers Grove, Illinois, said insurance for health care organizations has started to include exclusions for the Ebola virus. ####  ##### She said health care organizations that use captives might use those alternative risk transfer vehicles to insure Ebola-related liabilities, as well as emerging risks from an increased number of insured patients under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### But Rebecca Havlisch, system vice president of risk management/business health at Banner Health in Phoenix, said health care organizations should consider using captives to insure emerging risks only if they have plans in place to mitigate such issues. ####  ##### “We have to get back to the basics in managing some of these risks,” Ms. Havlisch said. “Ebola is emergency management. Cyber (is) evolving, but we still have to get back to managing them on a day-to-day basis.” ####  ##### Another exposure hospital risk managers must face is preventing violence in hospitals, said Carolyn Coleman, Lehigh Valley Health Network's Allentown, Pennsylvania-based director of risk management, who discussed a March 23, 2013, murder-suicide at the network's Allentown hospital. ####  ##### In discussing lessons learned from the event, Ms. Coleman said one step the hospital system has taken since then is having hospice patients' families answer questionnaires that ask whether there is a gun at home and if other members of the family have been in hospice care. ####  ##### Training hospital staff to make patients say their name and date of birth before a laboratory specimen is taken and refusing to accept improperly labeled specimens also was suggested as a way to reduce diagnostic errors. ####  ##### Health care workers were also warned that while electronic medical records can save money and improve outcomes, incorrectly using them can set up significant liability issues. ####  ##### Marianne DePaulo Plant, a partner at Goodell, Devries, and Leech & Dann L.L.P. in Baltimore, said doctors are not always aware that any medical record changes they make are easily discoverable, yet even the least sophisticated plaintiff attorneys routinely seek the information to prove providers' failure to review the medical records. ####  ##### In addition, medical record templates “give me more heartburn than any other part of electronic records” because of their ability to fill in the wrong information about a patient, said Craig R. Merkle, a partner at Goodell, DeVries. ####  ##### Meanwhile, health care risk managers received the good news that hospitals will not face sharply higher professional liability insurance costs next year, said Erik Johnson, the Raleigh, North Carolina-based director of Aon Risk Solutions' global risk consulting unit. ####  ##### Professional liability claims have been flat, and loss rates are increasing at a modest 2.5% annual rate, which will give health care opportunities “to actually take that flat curve and bend it down” to reduce costs, Mr. Johnson said of the annual study conducted for ASHRM. ####  ##### Nearly 2,000 people attended this year's ASHRM conference Oct. 26 to 29. ####  ##### Next year's conference is scheduled for Oct. 18 to 21, 2015, in Indianapolis. #### "
"Marsh Analytics Platform integrated with global loss database";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Marsh & McLennan, Tech Insights";" ##### Insurance broker Marsh L.L.C. said it is completing the global rollout of its proprietary analytics solution, Marsh Analytics Platform, which is now fully integrated with its claims database, Global Loss Data Library. ####  ##### The database contains $300 billion in aggregate claims data derived from dozens of countries and more than 20 industries, Marsh said Monday in a statement. The claims data is paired with placement information and analytics technology to deliver a holistic view of current and emerging trends in risk, the company said. ####  ##### By consolidating modeling with a growing loss database, the platform should enable the broker to deliver more effective insights to clients, according to Timothy Gardner, New York-based risk management global leader at Marsh. ####  ##### “We are starting to accumulate a really sizable perspective on global loss activity.” Mr. Gardner said in the statement. “It allows us to take client experience, which tends to be limited, and augment with our own perspective.” ####  ##### Mr. Gardner said the ultimate aim of the platform is to help broaden the conversation with clients from the insurance coverages a client may need in the coming year to more holistic discussions such as how best to align risk with capital. ####  ##### “Our view is that this platform is part of a changing dynamic of how insurance brokers advise their clients,” he said. “It gets us beyond the year-over-year questions of 'what did we pay last year' and instead helps answer more fundamental questions.” ####  ##### Mr. Gardner said one challenge the company has faced in establishing MAP has been training its global team of sales professionals to use the platform. “A big piece for us was rolling this out in a consistent global fashion,” he said. ####  ##### The platform's mobile-based application, known as iMAP, has been helpful in training colleagues around the globe, Mr. Gardner said. ####  ##### “The mobile application that we built allows us to scale the conversation more quickly,” he said. “We can train colleagues quickly, and they are ready to go.” #### "

"Maryland firm to pay $415K to settle EEOC race, gender bias case";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A Maryland environmental remediation services firm has agreed to pay $415,000 to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission race, gender discrimination and harassment lawsuit. ####  ##### The attorney for the firm, Rockville, Maryland-based ACM Services Inc., has denied the charges and said the company settled the case to avoid the cost of litigation. ####  ##### The agency on Friday said ACM had exclusively used word-of-mouth recruitment practices for field laborer positions in order to avoid hiring black job applicants. The EEOC also charged that ACM refused to hire black job applicants or female applicants for field laborer positions. ####  ##### The firm was also charged with subjecting two Hispanic female employees to harassment based on sex, national origin and race, and engaging in unlawful discrimination against them by terminating them when they opposed their treatment. The company was charged with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The settlement provides for $305,000 to be paid to a class of persons not hired or recruited because of race or sex and $110,000 to be paid to the two Hispanic female employees. ####  ##### The three-year consent decree resolving the lawsuit also enjoins ACM from engaging in any future race, sex or national origin discrimination or retaliation, and provides that the company implement numerical goals for hiring qualified black and female applicants, among other provisions. ####  ##### “We are pleased that ACM Services worked with us to resolve this lawsuit quickly and without engaging in protracted litigation,” EEOC Philadelphia regional attorney Debra M. Lawrence said in a statement. “These affirmative measures will benefit all employees and applicants. All employers should consider proactive measures to foster equal employment opportunities for job applicants and workers.” ####  ##### “ACM is very proud of the stellar reputation it has built over many years of hard work,” ACM attorney Jeffrey M. Schwaber, a principal with Stein Sperling Bennett De Jong Driscoll P.C. in Rockville, said in a statement. “It employs a qualified and diverse workforce, and does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.” ####  ##### “ACM denies any wrongdoing, but has a company to run, and after years of back-and-forth discussion with EEOC about this matter, ACM made the difficult decision to settle this case in a manner that avoided the enormous cost and distraction of protracted litigation, and to move on with the work it is set up to do. The matter has been resolved by agreement, and ACM looks forward to continued service and success.” ####  ##### In September, restaurant chain McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurants Inc. agreed to pay $1.3 million to resolve an EEOC-class race discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with refusing to hire African-Americans for front-of-the-house positions at its two Baltimore restaurant locations. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Coffee-injury fib lands would-be claimant in hot water";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### Spilling a false coffee-injury story requires keeping a tight lid on the facts or you might get burned, a California woman has learned. ####  ##### Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville, California, has been charged with fraud for claiming she had been scalded by coffee Jan. 28, 2013, at a McDonald’s drive-thru in Fontana, California, then downloading online photos to try to illustrate that she had suffered second-degree burns on her hand, according to media reports. ####  ##### She faces 21 felony counts of fraud for filing an injury claim in which she said she was handed a cup of coffee at a McDonald's drive-thru with an improperly secured lid that allowed the hot liquid to spill on her hand, the California Department of Insurance said Monday, according to Reuters. She submitted an injury claim with photos from a hospital website of a burned hand she said was her own, and submitted bogus documentation describing treatment she said she received at a hospital, according to the Department of Insurance. ####  ##### The Los Angeles Times reported that Ms. Edwards was seeking $10,000 from her claims. She was charged by the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office, according to the paper. ####  ##### Reuters reports the case against Ms. Edwards comes 20 years after a well-known product liability lawsuit in which Stella Liebeck won a $2.9 million civil judgment in New Mexico over burns she suffered at age 79 from hot coffee she bought at McDonald’s. That judgment was reduced to $480,000, and became the butt of jokes, symbolizing the problem of frivolous lawsuits for many people, Reuters said. ####  ##### But a significant difference between the cases remains: Ms. Liebeck actually suffered her third-degree burns, while California insurance officials say Ms. Edwards, on the other hand, made up her injury claim. ####  ##### “By copying legitimate burn photos from the Internet, Edwards attempted to make a profit from another person’s pain and suffering, and for this she will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement obtained by Reuters. #### "
"Negligence case over cruise line's care of passenger who died reinstated";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated charges of vicarious liability against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in connection with the death of an elderly passenger who was allegedly incompetently treated by ship medical personnel after a fall. ####  ##### Pasquale Vaglio was a passenger aboard Miami-based Royal Caribbean’s cruise ship “Explorer of the Seas” on July 23, 2011, when he fell boarding a trolley at a port-of-call in Bermuda and suffered a severe blow to his head, according to Monday’s ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami in Patricia Franza, as personal representative of the estate of Pasquale F. Vaglio v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., a Liberian corporation. ####  ##### When he was taken to the ship’s infirmary, he was told by a nurse, who did not administer or recommend any diagnostic scans, that he was fine to return to his cabin. ####  ##### After his condition deteriorated, he was seen four hours later for the first time by a shipboard doctor, who ordered Mr. Vaglio transferred to a local hospital, where he arrived another 2½ hours later. ####  ##### “By that time, Vaglio’s life was beyond saving,” said the ruling. Although he was transferred to a hospital in Mineola, New York, the day after his fall, he remained in intensive care until he died a week later. ####  ##### Mr. Vaglio’s daughter, Ms. Franza, filed suit in January 2013 against Royal Caribbean charging it with negligence in connection with her father’s death. The U.S. District Court in Miami dismissed the case in May 2013, citing a 1988 rule stemming from the decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Barbetta v. S/S Bermuda Star. ####  ##### The Barbetta rule immunizes a shipowner from liability whenever a ship’s employees render negligent medical care to its passengers, and “confers this broad immunity no matter how clear the ship owner’s control over its medical staff or how egregious the claimed acts of negligence,” according to the 11th Circuit. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the appellate court reinstated the charges against the cruise line in a unanimous ruling. ####  ##### “Much has changed in the quarter-century since Barbetta,” said the decision. “As we see it, the evolution of legal norms, the rise of a complex cruise industry, and the progression of medical technology have erased whatever utility the Barbetta rule may once have had.” ####  ##### “We thus decline to adopt the Barbetta rule, and find that the complaint in this case plausibly establishes a claim against Royal Caribbean,” said the ruling, in remanding the case for further proceedings. ####  ##### In 2013, the parents of a child who had to undergo emergency brain surgery because of an injury he sustained while playing a ball game during a Royal Caribbean cruise filed suit against the cruise line, charging it with negligence. The case was settled in February 2014 for an undisclosed amount, according to court records. #### "
"Aon tool sorts construction risk profiles for variety of jurisdictions";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Aon, Construction, Tech Insights";" ##### The construction services group at Aon Risk Solutions has launched a web-based tool to help clients manage the risks posed by working in multiple locations. ####  ##### The Construction Risk Portal comprises a risk map and register, which detail specific construction risk issues in various jurisdictions, while allowing clients to create risk profiles based on contributed data, Aon said in a statement released Tuesday. ####  ##### The risk map, a construction risk reference library, outlines specific risk issues that contribute to a jurisdiction’s overall construction risk rating, including litigation environments, legislation and insurance requirements, according to the statement. ####  ##### Clients can also contribute data to the risk register, which then produces a project- and location-specific risk profile that includes jurisdictional issues, such as state-specific statutes and case law; catastrophic risk exposure, such as windstorms and earthquakes; and a plot of the severity of the risks that may affect a construction project, Aon said in the statement. ####  ##### “As the construction landscape continues to grow, contractors entering new states continually express frustration when confronted with differences in regulation, statutory requirements and hazard risks between geographies,” Construction Services Group Executive Vice President Matt Walsh said in the statement. “The Construction Risk Portal will allow our clients and colleagues to have access 24 hours a day, seven days a week to statutory developments, case law, risk trends and regulatory updates to help facilitate the understanding of these dynamics.” #### "
"Building owners, contractors should be in agreement when buying insurance ";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, Aon, Construction";" ##### NASHVILLE, Tennessee — An emphasis on consensus-building between building owners and general contractors is essential when securing builders risk coverage, speakers said at the International Risk Management Institute Inc.'s 34th Construction Risk Conference. ####  ##### Scott Nissen, Houston-based managing director of the construction services group at Aon Risk Solutions, said building owners and general contractors need to agree on a variety of issues, ranging from which party will pay premiums and deductibles, to which parties will be named insureds, to who buys the coverage. ####  ##### Two important questions deal with “who has the duty to purchase insurance and what exactly needs to be procured,” Mr. Nissen said Monday during a panel discussion at the conference taking place in Nashville, Tennessee. “It's usually the owner, but perhaps 25% of the time the contractor does take over procurement of the insurance.” ####  ##### Fellow panelist Tracy Saxe, New York-based partner at law firm Saxe Doernberger & Vita P.C., said his thinking on who should procure the coverage has evolved. While he once thought that general contractors were best suited to determine their needs under a builders risk policy, he now thinks that building owners are better able to gauge the impact of “soft costs” that need to be covered. ####  ##### As opposed to “hard costs,” which are the amount of money needed to physically repair or replace damaged or destroyed property on a jobsite, soft costs largely result from business interruption. Additional interest expenses and property taxes that still accumulate even if work on a building site stops due to an accident are good examples of soft costs, Mr. Saxe said. ####  ##### “If a general contractor does buy a builders risk policy, it should have the appropriate business interruption, time element and soft-cost coverages,” he said. “But in order to do that, you will need cooperation with the owner from the outset.” ####  ##### Mr. Saxe said efforts by owners and contractors to spend the time upfront to make sure that risks are shared equitably would pay dividends in the end. ####  ##### “You need (to) recognize that you have a common peril,” he said. “If everybody in the project who needs to be covered by a first-party policy is covered, there may be less of a need to point fingers and hire lawyers to figure out who is at fault.” #### "

"OFF BEAT: Cyber villain's process a testament to patience";"Risk Management";"";" ##### As cyber attacks become increasingly common and sophisticated, it’s easy to imagine James Bond-style supervillains running megacomputers in labyrinthine underground fortresses gleefully attacking our favorite politicians, retailers and sandwich shops. ####  ##### But if one recently jailed European hacker is to be believed, the process is far less complicated and glamorous. ####  ##### The New York Times recently reported on Romanian hacker Marcel-Lehel Lazar, an unemployed 43-year-old Transylvanian who went by the online handle Guccifer. ####  ##### Mr. Lazar is serving a seven-year sentence in a Romanian prison after a two-year spree where he is credited with such acts as hacking the flirty emails of a bikini-wearing Romanian politician sent to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whom he also hacked, the newspaper said. ####  ##### Other Internet exploits revealed private self-portraits painted by President George W. Bush as well as hacks of a variety of celebrities’ accounts, all while eluding U.S. and international authorities. ####  ##### Although he admitted to the newspaper to using Russian proxy servers to cover his tracks, that was his highest level of sophistication. He told the Times that in addition to using a lot of time and patience to obtain passwords, in the end, Guccifer’s methods were simple — he guessed. #### "
"RenRe acquisition of Platinum may signal trend in soft reinsurance market";"Risk Management";"Bermuda, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### While RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.'s $1.9 billion purchase of fellow Bermuda reinsurer Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd. will bear specific fruit for the buyer, the deal is being driven at least in part by overall soft market conditions coupled with an abundance of capital — and may portend further deals. ####  ##### The deal, announced Monday, would see RenRe paying $76 in stock and cash per share of Platinum, a 24% premium to Platinum's closing price of $61.27 on Friday. ####  ##### Platinum's shareholders will get a $10-per-share special dividend, and will be able to choose the rest in the form of $66 in cash or 0.6504 in RenaissanceRe shares or a combination of $35.96 in cash and 0.2960 RenaissanceRe stock. ####  ##### RenRe has expressed interest in enlarging its casualty reinsurance business, and this is an ideal opportunity to do just that, according to analyst Brett Shirreffs, New York-based vice president with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. ####  ##### “This is clearly a sign that they are serious about these intentions, and it's clearly an effort to grow more rapidly in casualty reinsurance than they would have been able to build organically,” said Mr. Shirreffs. ####  ##### Casualty reinsurance represents over half of Platinum's book of business, said Mr. Shirreffs, and the business has been extremely profitable, making it an ideal fit for RenRe's growth plans. ####  ##### Overall market conditions, however, also played a role in the deal. ####  ##### Softening rates and increased competition from abundant sources of alternative capital have “caused RenRe to be more interested in non-property catastrophe business,” said Mr. Shirreffs. Similarly, “Platinum has been forced to shrink as a result of market dynamics,” rendering it a likely takeover candidate, he said. ####  ##### “The organic growth outlook looks soft,” said John L. Ward, CEO of Cincinnatus Partners L.L.C. in Loveland, Ohio, adding that the deal could be a harbinger of things to come. ####  ##### “I think we're going to be seeing some announcements” about further deals, said Mr. Ward, possibly even before the year's end. ####  ##### “The year-end does bring out a lot of deal announcements, so I would not be surprised to see more announcements before year-end, but generally I'm looking at this as maybe a six-to-18-month industry development,” he said. #### "

The action came as several published reports indicated that negotiations between the House and Senate over reauthorization of the program, which will expire Dec. 31 unless extended, had broken down over House negotiators' desire to insert non-insurance related language dealing with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in reauthorization legislation. ####  ##### The ongoing dispute leaves the future of the terrorism backstop in doubt. ####  ##### The new House bill would extend the program for six years and gradually raise the minimum trigger to activate the program to $200 million from the current $100 million. The bill would also create a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers to streamline interstate agency licensing. ####  ##### An earlier version of the bill passed by the House Financial Services Committee but never voted on by the full House would have extended the program for five years while gradually increasing the trigger for most future catastrophic terrorism attacks to $500 million. ####  ##### The Senate approved its own bill, which would extend the program for seven years while leaving the $100 million trigger intact, earlier this year. ####  ##### House and Senate negotiators appeared close to an agreement late last week, raising the possibility that the program would be reauthorized as part of a larger budget bill. #### "

"Corporate culture key to workplace gender equality, diversity: Speakers ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Ace, Chubb, Willis Group";" ##### NEW YORK — As companies formulate strategies for promoting gender equality and diversity in the workplace, it is critical that the programs they put in place to achieve that end match their overall corporate culture, a panel of experts said on Tuesday. ####  ##### At the Cleveland, Ohio-based brokerage Oswald Cos., CEO Robert Klonk has taken a top-down, hands-on approach to providing female professionals at his firm with a clearer path to advancement within the company. ####  ##### “We had a lot of talented and ambitious women in our organization who really didn't have a channel that they could go to and map out a path to a leadership role,” Mr. Klonk said Tuesday during a panel discussion at Business Insurance's 2014 Women to Watch Leadership Conference and Awards in New York. “With many of their help, we formed what we call the Women's Leadership Council in 2013.” ####  ##### Mr. Klonk said the council offers women within the Oswald organization “an outlet to work together and find ways to become leaders both within the organization and among their peer groups.” ####  ##### “It's been great to watch and see internally how a lot of their leadership skills have improved,” he said. ####  ##### Alongside the council's formation, Mr. Klonk said the company also named Janice Tomlinson, a former executive vice president and international field operations manager at Chubb Corp., as its first female board member in the company's 121-year history. ####  ##### “What I've seen at Oswald, and the reason I'm so committed to this is that every member of their leadership teams walks the walk,” Ms. Tomlinson said. “That support from senior leadership is crucially important.” ####  ##### Establishing a dedicated networking, discussion and educational group for female professionals has also proven successful at Philadelphia-based Ace Ltd., according to the company's deputy general counsel, Deborah Giss Stalker. ####  ##### “For me, it's been fascinating to watch the evolution,” Ms. Stalker said during the discussion. “We started with chapters in nine different regions in the U.S., and today's it's grown to more than 20. ####  ##### “It's a safe place for women to talk and network with women inside and out of organization that they'd ordinarily never meet, and it's been a phenomenal platform for bringing them into the view of senior leadership,” she added. ####  ##### Some firms, such as New York-based Willis North America, have expanded their efforts to emphasize and promote diversity beyond the four walls of their own organizations by making a concerted effort to build vendor relationships with women-owned and minority-owned businesses. ####  ##### “From my perspective, it drives both the value proposition and the business case for building diverse teams across the industry,” said Kim Waller, Chicago-based executive vice president at Willis. “Ideally, what we’re doing is partnering with firms that complement us, either by doing something that we don’t do or just doing it differently, which means we’re able to touch the client in a way that may be more hands-on.” ####  ##### Another benefit to partnering with a more diverse range of vendor companies, Ms. Waller said, is that “people begin to learn how to respect each other and hear each other’s voices and ideas.” ####  ##### “The only way to do that is to experience it,” she added. ####  ##### In rarer cases, some firms have found their corporate philosophy and culture to be naturally conducive to women’s advancement through the company’s upper ranks. ####  ##### “Nineteen of our 25 offices are run and managed by female managing partners,” said Steven Testan, founder and senior managing partner at the Van Nuys, California-based Law Offices of Adelson, Testan, Brundo, Novell, and Jimenez. “We haven’t had to create an initiative to make up for a deficiency, because we’ve never had one. We hired the best of the best, and it turned out that women would make up 76% of our managing partners, and 52% of our total lawyer staff.” ####  ##### “It’s been interesting to watch, especially where we’re trying to get men to come in and work under women, because I think it takes a special kind of man to be led by women,” said Karen Stankevitz, director of consulting services at the law firm. “Our organization does look very different, but it’s very supportive organization.” #### "

"Ex-NFL players' case against EA Sports' video game franchise can proceed";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A federal appeals court has refused to dismiss a case filed by former professional football players against a video game producer over the use of their likenesses, rejecting the producer's argument that the use is protected under the First Amendment. ####  ##### “We are called upon to balance the right of publicity of former professional football players against Electronic Arts' First Amendment right to use their likenesses in its Madden NFL series of video games,” says Tuesday's unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in Michael E. Davis et al. v. Electronic Arts Inc. ####  ##### According to the ruling, each annual version of the game in question, “Madden NFL,” includes all current players for all 32 National Football League teams along with accurate player names, team logos, colors and uniforms, for which Redwood City, California-based Electronic Arts pays annual licensing fees. ####  ##### In addition, however, from 2001 through 2009, the game also included certain particularly successful or popular “historic teams” for which no license was obtained. ####  ##### Although the players on these historic teams were not identified by name or photograph, each is described by his position, years in the NFL, height, weight, skin tone “and relative skill level in different aspects of the sport,” says the ruling. ####  ##### Electronic Arts states “its use of former players' likenesses is protected under the First Amendment as 'incidental use,'” says the ruling. “We disagree. ####  ##### “We hold (Electronic Arts') use of former players is not incidental because it is central to (Electronic Arts') main commercial purpose — to create a realistic virtual simulation of football games involving current and former (National Football League) teams,” says the appeals panel, in upholding a ruling by the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. ####  ##### In a comparable lawsuit in July 2013, a divided 9th Circuit panel ruled against Electronic Arts in a lawsuit filed by former collegiate athletes who accused the company of using their images in video games without permission. #### "

"Insurer CEOs say success depends on smart risk selection";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, FM Global, Hartford Financial, SCOR";" ##### NEW YORK — Increased capacity in the property/casualty market is putting more pressure on insurers and reinsurers, and they will need to adapt their operating strategies in order to succeed, a group of senior executives from across the sector said. ####  ##### Improved risk selection and closer relationships with policyholders and intermediaries should be key concerns as insurers and reinsurers seek to expand profitably, they said late Tuesday during the “CEO Panel” at the Property/Casualty Insurance Joint Industry Forum in New York. ####  ##### With the huge amount of capital in the market “we are going to have to be much smarter in how we choose our risks and where we deploy our capital,” said Henry Klecan Jr., president and CEO of Scor U.S. Corp. in New York. ####  ##### For reinsurers, that means selecting cedents that have infrastructure and technology in place to understand fully their policyholders' business, he said. ####  ##### Risk selection is important for insurers, too, said Christopher J. Swift, chairman and CEO of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. in Hartford, Connecticut. ####  ##### In addition, Hartford is seeking to build stronger relationships with certain agents — particularly in the Midwest — to make the insurer “easier to do business with.” ####  ##### While increased capacity in the property/casualty market is a challenge for insurers, the infrequency of catastrophe losses over the past year has been a boon for property insurers, said Thomas A. Lawson, president and CEO of FM Global in Johnston, Rhode Island. ####  ##### “If you can't make money in large risk property in this environment, you should probably hang it up,” he said. ####  ##### However, there is increased pressure in premium rates, and insurers will need to analyze closely issues such as risk location and loss control to achieve above average results, he said. ####  ##### The annual forum was held by the Insurance Information Institute. #### "
"Proposed settlement of $200 million reached in Quebec rail explosion";"Risk Management";"Canada";" ##### A proposed partial settlement of nearly $200 million has been reached in the 2013 Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, train derailment and explosion disaster, attorneys said. ####  ##### The July 6, 2013, accident killed 48 people and destroyed more than 30 buildings after unattended train cars carrying fuel oil derailed and some of the cars exploded, causing Canada's worst railway catastrophe in about 150 years. ####  ##### Participants in the settlement include the now-bankrupt Montreal Maine & Atlantic Canada Co., the attorneys said Friday in a statement. ####  ##### “We are pleased to finally reach a partial resolution and settlement for the victims of the train derailment disaster,” said Robert Keach, the appointed trustee for the rail company's bankruptcy case, in the statement. “Due to the diligence and respect by all parties associated with this plan in Canada and the United States, we have put forward a favorable resolution.

Lewis Jr., in the statement. “This case demonstrates that the consequences of failing to comply with the ADA can be far more expensive than the actual cost of providing a reasonable accommodation.” ####  ##### Kmart said in a statement, it “has always maintained strong anti-discrimination and accommodation policies and takes its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act very seriously. We vigorously disagree with allegations made by the EEOC in this case and decided to settle solely to avoid the burden, expense, and uncertainties involved in continued litigation and to eliminate disruption to our day-to-day businesses. Resolution of this matter allows us to focus our energies and resources on providing our customers and members with superior service and value. ####  ##### In June, the EEOC announced a $30,000 settlement with the Fort-Worth, Texas-based Fort Worth Center of Rehabilitation in a suit involving a similar situation, while in October, it announced a $72,500 settlement with Wal-Mart Stores East, L.L.P., a unit of Bentonville Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., in a case that also involved drug testing of a job applicant with a kidney disorder. #### "

More midsize losses than usual, incentive compensation and severance payments had a negative effect on the combined ratio, a spokesman said Friday in an email. ####  ##### The company said in a statement that it excludes nonrecurring items, such as the “costs associated with defending the unsolicited approach from Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd.,” when calculating operating income, as such items “are not reflective of underlying performance.” Aspen successfully thwarted Endurance’s $3.2 billion hostile takeover bid last year. ####  ##### For all of 2014, net income increased 8.0% to $355.8 million. Yearly net written premiums increased 9.4% to $2.52 billion, while net investment income increased 2.1% to $190.3 million. The combined ratio for 2014 improved to 91.7% from 92.6% last year. ####  ##### “For the full year, we grew premiums slightly while achieving an accident year ex-(catastrophe) loss ratio of 50.9%,” Stephen Postlewhite, Aspen’s CEO of reinsurance, said in the statement. “As a result of our client relationships and access to risk, we were able to withdraw capital from areas where rates and terms and conditions did not meet our requirements and deploy it in areas where the business was better rated.” ####  ##### During a conference call announcing the results, Aspen CEO Chris O’Kane said the company doesn’t view U.S. reinsurance as a growth area. Rather, he said, growth is coming from smaller economies across continental Europe, Asia and Latin America. ####  ##### Scott Kirk, chief financial officer for Aspen, said during the call that the company had about $30 million in noncorrelated midsize losses last year, including a fire in Spain that cost them $11 million. ####  ##### Mr. O’Kane said in the statement that Aspen maintained a “disciplined underwriting approach during the January reinsurance renewal season as we reduced our book where rates and terms did not meet our return requirements while achieving meaningful growth in areas where overall return remain attractive.” #### "

"Brokerage buying spree made 2014 a record year for mergers and acquisitions";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### Private equity-backed buyers expanded their ownership of insurance brokerages in 2014, contributing to a record number of announced mergers and acquisitions in the United States and Canada amid strong pricing for sellers. ####  ##### The 357 deals in 2014, 11.2% more than the previous record of 321 M&As in 2012, do not include international acquisitions completed by some of the major U.S. brokers amid companies' ongoing expansion overseas. ####  ##### A mad rush to get deals done to avoid a five percentage point increase in the capital gains tax, which rose to 20% on Jan. 1, 2013, propelled 2012 activity. After M&As slowed as expected in early 2013, the pace has been brisk ever since. ####  ##### Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Hub International Ltd. tied for the largest number of announced deals in 2014, followed by AssuredPartners Inc., Acrisure L.L.C. and BroadStreet Partners Inc. ####  ##### Eight of the 10 most active acquirers completed 10 or ####  ##### more deals during the year; 106 completed only one or two transactions. In all, 128 companies made acquisitions in 2014 vs. 114 in 2013 and 131 in 2012. ####  ##### Led by Hub, AssuredPartners and Acrisure, six private-equity buyers completed more than 10 deals. The private equity-based acquirers closed 44% of deals last year, up from 34% in 2012 and 21% in 2008. Since 2012, 14 of the top 25 acquirers have been brokers backed by private equity funds, furthering their dominant position in the marketplace. ####  ##### The only buyer category showing less activity in 2014 was the bank-owned group, where only 13 announced deals marked the lowest number since 2008. ####  ##### The other categories — publicly traded, privately owned and all other types of buyers — registered increases compared with 2013. ####  ##### Privately owned brokers set a record in 2014 with 113 announced transactions by 75 separate acquirers, only two short of the 2012 high mark of 77. Digital Insurance Inc. led the privately held group with seven deals. ####  ##### Deals closed by public brokers increased from 34 in 2013 to 56 in 2014, a 64% increase but off the 2012 high of 72. ####  ##### Gallagher led the pack among publicly held brokers followed by Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C. and Brown & Brown Inc. Over the past seven years, Gallagher and Marsh & McLennan Agency significantly increased their share of the publicly held broker deals, while Brown & Brown had the largest decline in its number and share of deals. ####  ##### Stand-alone property/casualty brokers continue to be the most sought-after sellers, representing 40% to 45% of total annual transactions. Benefits-only brokers and brokers offering property/casualty and benefits account for another 20% to 25%, with the balance of the deals generally made up of managing general agents, wholesalers and miscellaneous distribution channels. ####  ##### Despite the U.S. health care reform law, the percentage of benefits-only or property/ casualty/benefit agencies being sold has not changed to any significant degree in recent years. ####  ##### Among the largest purchases made in 2014 were Marsh & McLennan Agency's purchase of San Diego-based Barney & Barney L.L.C. and Greensboro, North Carolina-based Senn Dunn Insurance. In addition, Gallagher acquired Toronto-based Noraxis Corp. ####  ##### Looking ahead, the economy has been trending favorable, premiums remain relatively stable albeit with some recent apparent softness, and the near-term outlook is generally for more of the same. ####  ##### There is very strong demand on the buy-side from the private equity-backed and publicly held brokers to attract high-quality sellers. Given the current finite inventory, seller's market pricing prevails with multiples at historically high levels. ####  ##### That said, the natural marketplace forces eventually will shift buyer and seller behavior. Until we reach that point of equilibrium, barring unforeseen economic and/or insurance calamities, we would anticipate this active M&A market to continue. A large number of aging agency principals need to capitalize their value, but only a few are adequately prepared for any type of internal succession. ####  ##### Timothy J. Cunningham and Daniel P.

"Allstate cleared of EEOC retaliation charges";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### An appeals court has reaffirmed dismissal of retaliation charges against Allstate Insurance Co. by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in connection with conversion of its agent workforce to independent contractors. ####  ##### According to Friday’s ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Allstate Insurance Co., the case revolves around a series of moves the insurer made to change the way it sells insurance. ####  ##### In 1990, Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate introduced a program under which all new Allstate agents worked as independent contractors rather than at-will employees, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In November 1999, the insurer also gave 6,200 employee-agents who would be terminated the following year various options, including the opportunity to convert to independent contractor status, upon which they would receive a bonus of at least $5,000, among other benefits. ####  ##### They were required, however, to sign a release of all legal claims against the company. Several agents filed individual and putative class actions against Allstate. ####  ##### They were joined by the EEOC, which filed a civil action of its own, charging the insurer with illegal retaliation because it allowed the agents to continue their careers only if they waived any discrimination claims, according to the ruling. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Philadelphia initially granted summary judgment to Allstate in both cases in 2007, but the 3rd Circuit vacated those rulings in 2009 because they were “inadequately reasoned and insufficiently supported the evidence,” said the appellate court. ####  ##### The case was then remanded and handled by another judge, who consolidated the cases and granted Allstate summary judgment in the EEOC’s retaliation suit. The judge held the conversion option “was not facially retaliatory because the policy did not discriminate on the basis of any protected trait,” the appellate ruling said. ####  ##### The three-judge panel unanimously agreed. ####  ##### “Allstate followed the well-established rule that employers can require terminated employees to waive existing legal claims in order to receive unearned post-termination benefits,” said the appellate panel in upholding the case’s dismissal. ####  ##### “The EEOC has neither given us reason to craft an exception to this rule, nor articulated a valid retaliation claim under the relevant statutes.” #### "

"Soft rockers Hall & Oates play hardball with granola brand";"Risk Management";"Off Beat";" ##### Daryl Hall and John Oates, whose 1972 debut album featured a canister of oatmeal on the cover, are suing a granola company for naming a product “Haulin’ Oats.” ####  ##### The musical duo, known as Hall & Oates, filed a complaint against Brooklyn-based Early Bird Foods & Co. L.L.C. on Wednesday alleging trademark infringement. ####  ##### The complaint states that Haulin’ Oats is an “obvious play” on Hall & Oates, and that it’s meant “to trade off of the fame and notoriety associated with the artists.” ####  ##### For those who are wondering, Haulin’ Oats includes rolled oats and maple syrup and can be eaten by itself or used “as the base for a breakfast parfait creation,” according to Early Bird Foods’ website. ####  ##### “Over the years, various third parties have attempted to … make a connection between the artists’ names and oats-related products,” the complaint states. “In fact, Daryl Hall and John Oates made this same connection from their inception, as the group’s first full length musical sound recording was entitled ‘Whole Oats.’” ####  ##### “Hall and Oates’ company, Whole Oats Enterprises, owns a Federal Trademark Registration for the identical mark ‘Haulin Oats’ covering breakfast foods that is used in connection with the sale of ‘Haulin Oats’ branded oatmeal by Whole Oats Enterprises’ licensee,” a manager for the artists told media outlets. “Early Bird Foods’ use of the mark on their own products is likely to confuse consumers and lead them to believe that such products are affiliated with or approved by Hall & Oates, which is not the case. Prior attempts to discuss this matter with Early Bird Foods were unsuccessful, and Whole Oats was left with no other choice but to file suit in order to protect its valuable marks and goodwill.” ####  ##### According to a Rolling Stone report, when the magazine asked Early Bird Foods founder Nekisia Davis to comment on the complaint, she replied, “Say it isn’t so,” which also happens to be the name of a 1983 single by Hall & Oates. #### "
"PAM Transport settles EEOC disability bias suit";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### An Arkansas trucking firm has been ordered to pay $477,399 in a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination lawsuit in which it was charged with subjecting its truck-driver workforce to overly broad medical inquires. ####  ##### Tontitown, Arkansas-based PAM Transport Inc.’s medical clearance policy required all drivers to notify the company whenever the driver had any contact with a medical professional, including a routine physical, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the agency said Wednesday in a statement. ####  ##### The agency said that in April 2012, the U.S. District Court in Detroit issued an order mandating the company to change its medical clearance policy to make medical inquiries of drivers only when they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. To help resolve remaining issues, the court appointed a retired judge as a third-party decision-maker. ####  ##### The EEOC said an order entered Feb. 26 requires PAM to pay $225,998 in back pay and interest, $9,114 in compensatory damages and $202,287 in punitive damages to 12 of its former truck drivers. ####  ##### “A punitive damages award almost equal to the other awarded damages reinforces the ADA’s prohibition against impermissible medical inquiries,” said Laurie Young, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Indianapolis district, in a statement ####  ##### The company’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### In September, the EEOC charged a power generation equipment company with violating the ADA by requiring an employee to submit overly broad medical release forms. #### "

"Senate panel takes up cyber insurance issues";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, Regulation, Risk Management, Lockton, Zurich, Insurance-linked Securities";" ##### A single federal standard for notifying victims of cyber security breaches is preferable to the current patchwork of state laws, an attorney who is also a professor of insurance law told a Senate panel on Thursday ####  ##### Michael Menapace, counsel in the Hartford, Connecticut, office of Wiggin & Dana L.L.P. and an adjunct professor of law at Hamden, Connecticut-based Quinnipiac University, made that observation as the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security held its first hearing on cyber insurance. ####  ##### Mr. Menapace noted that that current system of 47 state standards plus standards promulgated by the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not uniform in terms of how they are triggered and what information must be contained in them. A uniform standard would reduce the cost of breach responses and enhance consumer protection, he said. ####  ##### The subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said cyber insurance “may be a market-led approach to help businesses improve their cyber security posture by tying policy eligibility or lower premiums to better cyber security practices.” ####  ##### Ben Beeson, the Washington-based vice president for cyber security and privacy with Lockton Cos. L.L.C., agreed, saying the cyber insurance is an important market force that can drive improved cyber security for companies. Mr. Beeson said that Lockton and “we believe the industry as a whole” would welcome the introduction of legislation that would reduce barriers and encourage organizations to share threat indicators with the government and each other while also protecting individual privacy. ####  ##### Catherine Mulligan, senior vice president of the management solutions group at Zurich North America, pointed out that discussions on greater sharing of information between public and private bodies are currently underway. She said that while it's too early to come to any definitive conclusions, the “potential upside” of the discussions is that more comprehensive information will help insurers in developing both coverage and risk management solutions for their policyholders. #### "

"Premera Blue Cross breached, medical information exposed";"Risk Management";"Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### (Reuters) — Health insurer Premera Blue Cross said on Tuesday it was a victim of a cyber attack that may have exposed medical data and financial information of 11 million customers in the latest case of a health care company reporting a serious breach. ####  ##### It said the attackers may have gained access to claims data, including clinical information, along with banking account numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data in an attack that began in May 2014 and was uncovered Jan. 29. ####  ##### It is the largest breach reported to date involving patient medical information, according to Dave Kennedy, an expert in healthcare security who is chief executive of TrustedSEC L.L.C. ####  ##### Breaches over the past year at health insurer Anthem Inc. and hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. involved a larger number of records, but those companies said they believe the attackers did not access medical information. ####  ##### Medical records are highly valuable on underground criminal exchanges where stolen data is sold because the information is not only highly confidential, it can also be used to engage in insurance fraud. ####  ##### “Medical records paint a really personal picture of somebody's life and medical procedures,” Mr. Kennedy said. “They allow you to perpetrate really in-depth medical fraud.” ####  ##### The insurer said it has so far uncovered no evidence to show that member data was “used inappropriately.” ####  ##### “We at Premera take this issue seriously and sincerely regret the concern it may cause,” CEO Jeff Roe said in a statement. ####  ##### Premera has set up a hot line to field members' calls and offering free credit monitoring. More information is available at http://www.premeraupdate.com. ####  ##### “As much as possible, we want to make this event our burden, not that of the affected individuals,” Mr. Roe said in the statement. ####  ##### Premera is working with the FBI and FireEye Inc. to investigate the matter. ####  ##### The attack affected Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and affiliate brands Vivacity and Connexion Insurance Solutions. ####  ##### FBI spokesman Joshua Campbell told Reuters the agency is investigating the attack. #### "

He was chosen by the Jaguars 39th overall in the 2014 draft and signed a four-year, $5.17 million deal. ####  ##### The Orange County Register reported that Mr. Lee filed his action after Lloyd’s denied his claim for the $4.5 million difference between the policy and his NFL contract. ####  ##### SI.com reports that the lawsuit states Mr. Lee tried to collect on the policy two weeks after the draft, but Lloyd’s alleged that he hid medical information about his injury. Lloyd’s subsequently refunded Mr. Lee’s premium, plus interest, and has asked a New Jersey court to rule that the policy was never applied. ####  ##### Mr. Lee’s lawsuit states he seeks “to make an example of the defendants and in order to deter similar conduct” and says Lloyd’s of London used “repeated delay tactics,” SI.com reports. ####  ##### Mr. Lee gained an unmemorable 422 yards on 37 receptions with one touchdown last season, according to ESPN.com. #### "
"Captive insurers can mitigate political, trade credit risks ";"Risk Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Risk Management, Political Risk";" ##### ORLANDO, Fla. — As political and trade credit risk rise in importance to multinational corporations, captives can be used to help mitigate such risks, according to a panel speaking at the Captive Insurance Companies Association conference Monday in Orlando. ####  ##### “Political risk has been in the news” from the Arab Spring three years ago to the more recent tensions between Ukraine and Russia, said Stephen Kay, senior vice president and U.S. practice leader for political risk for Marsh USA Inc. in New York. ####  ##### Mr. Kay said recent surveys show “political risk as one of the key issues that have risen to the attention of the C-suite,” citing a December survey by McKinsey & Co. that named political risk as the No. 1 issue of urgent concern to corporations. ####  ##### Indeed, a live poll conducted while the panel was speaking showed 87.5% of the audience said political risk was greater than a year ago, while only 12.5% saw it as the same and none said it was lower. ####  ##### David Anderson, Washington-based director for global business development for Zurich North America's credit and political risk business, gave two case study examples of how corporations have used a captive structure to help manage political and trade credit risk. ####  ##### In the first, $50 million of trade credit insurance for a commodities trader was secured through a $7 million captive facility together with a separate $43 million Zurich policy, allowing the risk manager to craft a “global financial risk solution” featuring both “diversification of risk” and “arms-length pricing provided by an insurer,” Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### In another example, a global drilling company secured $100 million in political risk insurance with a $10 million captive facility combined with a $90 million reinsurance limit from Zurich, Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### The greatest benefit of captives, said Rod Morris, Fountain Hills, Arizona-based CEO of R&Q Captive Management, is “that it allows risk managers and corporations to take control of their own destiny to a much greater extent” than as a consumer in the marketplace. #### "

"Executive alleges partner said he wanted to 'smack' him against a wall";"Risk Management";"D&O";" ##### (Reuters) — TPG Capital was sued on Thursday by its former head of public affairs, who accused the private equity giant of ignoring his warnings that the firm may have violated securities regulations and defrauded investors out of millions of dollars as a result. ####  ##### The whistleblower lawsuit, almost without precedent in the tight-knit world of private equity, was filed by Adam Levine, who had been an assistant White House press secretary under President George W. Bush in 2002-2003 and then worked at TPG from 2008 until the end of 2014. Mr. Levine says he was asked to leave the firm by senior executives after he raised concerns about TPG's conduct, according to his lawsuit. ####  ##### TPG, which has $65 billion under management and has, according to the lawsuit, been considering an initial public offering, was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### TPG, co-founded in 1992 by Chairman David Bonderman, sued Mr. Levine in January, accusing him of downloading confidential documents including an internal email about TPG's billing process and leaking them to the media. Mr. Levine said in his lawsuit that allegations he breached confidentiality agreements were false. ####  ##### Mr. Levine's suit alleges that TPG, whose past deals have included the takeovers of Burger King, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the biggest-ever leveraged buyout — the $32 billion takeover of Texas utility TXU — miss-billed expenses, was flouting compliance rules and gave inaccurate information about its investment team. ####  ##### According to the filing in the San Francisco/Oakland division of the U.S. District Court in Northern California, Mr. Levine said he raised concerns that TPG was engaged in practices that he believed ""violated securities laws, rules and regulations"" but was brushed off by its executives. ####  ##### The suit alleges that in response to some of Mr. Levine's concerns, TPG partner and senior counsel Clive Bode said if San Francisco-based Mr. Levine were in the same room as him, he would ""smack"" Mr. Levine's head into a wall and ""knock some f---ing sense"" into him. ####  ##### Mr. Bode also told Mr. Levine he would have ""hunted"" him down and had him ""gutted like a carp"" if Mr. Levine had sent one particular email to Mr. Bode, according to the lawsuit. That email detailing some of Mr. Levine's concerns had gone to other executives. Mr. Bode allegedly also told Mr. Levine that he would ""f---ing kill you"" if Mr. Levine brought ""Bonderman into it."" ####  ##### Mr. Bode could not be immediately reached for comment. ####  ##### Contacted the SEC ####  ##### Mr. Levine has contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission to disclose the alleged violations of regulations at TPG, the suit claims. SEC spokeswoman Florence Harmon said the regulator declined to comment. ####  ##### Mr. Levine is bringing claims under federal and state whistleblower laws, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created a private cause of action for whistleblowers whose employers retaliate against them for lawfully providing information to the SEC. His suit does not specifically address TPG's case against him, which was filed in Texas. ####  ##### The suit also alleges that one TPG fundraiser misrepresented when TPG's Chief Investment Officer Jonathan Coslet started his job to make it seem that his investment record was better than it was, and alleges that TPG billed its portfolio companies with expenses that should have been charged to the business itself. ####  ##### It also claims the firm was planning to expand its public affairs department by billing consultants time to portfolio companies rather than to TPG, which Mr. Levine argued was in breach of SEC regulations. ####  ##### Private equity funds typically raise capital from investors and use that to buy companies. They aim to improve the value of those companies and sell them some years later at a profit. ####  ##### Mr. Coslet could not be immediately reached for comment. ####  ##### Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG claimed in its lawsuit that Mr. Levine referred to himself as a ""weapon of mass destruction"" and someone who could ""bring TPG down in 10 days."" TPG is seeking an injunction requiring Mr. Levine to return any of its confidential documents and electronic devices. ####  ##### Mr. Levine says he was prompted to bring his concerns to TPG management after he attended a speech in May 2014 by Andrew Bowden, a director at the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. In the speech, Mr. Bowden said private equity funds routinely hide fees and overcharge investors. ####  ##### Mr. Bowden said that an examination of advisers by OCIE showed violations of law or material weaknesses in controls over 50% of the time regarding how expenses and fees are handled. One example he highlighted was expenses being shifted to the client without proper disclosure. ####  ##### Mr. Levine claims that bad practices highlighted by Mr. Bowden, such as private equity funds pushing expenses onto portfolio companies — and therefore onto the investors in its funds — when those costs should have been incurred by the management company itself, were ""commonplace"" at TPG. ####  ##### Mr. Levine claims in the lawsuit that he is entitled to up to $738,761 for noncash compensation owed to him, as well as general damages to recompense him for emotional distress. He is also seeking punitive damages. #### "

"Dismissal of Liberty Mutual pregnancy discrimination case upheld ";"Risk Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Risk Management, Liberty Mutual";" ##### A U.S. appeals court has affirmed dismissal of a pregnancy discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a former Liberty Mutual Group Inc. sales representative, stating her evidence was insufficient to support her claims. ####  ##### Autumn K. Brown began working as a sales representative for Boston-based Liberty Mutual In 2004, and as a lead sales representative received the assistance of a sales associate, according to last week’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Autumn K. Brown v. Liberty Mutual Group Inc. ####  ##### On Jan. 11, 2011, Ms. Brown told her supervisor, Lynn Peters, that she was pregnant, and Ms. Peters responded she had never had a pregnant person in her office before, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Shortly after, Ms. Peters began to question Ms. Brown’s sales performance and admonished her that she risked losing her sales associate’s assistance if Ms. Brown failed to meet her sales expectations, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Meanwhile, during the first week of January, an auditor who was unaware of Ms. Brown’s pregnancy discovered a number of insurance policies in which the information Ms. Brown entered did not match the information provided by the policyholders, the ruling says. Although meetings were held on the matter, Ms. Brown received no disciplinary action as a result of the audit, the ruling said. ####  ##### In February, Ms. Brown went on a previously scheduled vacation to South Africa. Upon her return, she requested and received short-term disability and medical leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. In April 2011, before the end of her medical leave, she resigned from her position with Liberty Mutual. ####  ##### About a year later, she filed suit against the insurer, stating it had subjected her to pregnancy-based discrimination, a hostile work environment and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as interference with her FMLA rights. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Dallas granted Liberty Mutual summary judgment dismissing the case, and a three-judge appeals court panel unanimously upheld the ruling. ####  ##### “Brown argues that Peters’ exhortations to improve her sales performance and threats to take away her sales associate constituted a constructive discharge by forcing Brown to resign. However, informal criticisms of an employee’s work rarely suffices to support a finding of construction termination,” the appeals panel said. ####  ##### The ruling also states that “neither Peters nor any other employees made any derogatory comments regarding Brown’s pregnancy other than Peters’ initial observation she had not had a pregnant employee before Brown,” and “more importantly, the treatment experienced was not so severe as to create an abusive working environment.” ####  ##### The U.S. Supreme Court has revived a part-time worker’s pregnancy discrimination suit against United Parcel Service Inc., which experts say puts employers on notice that they should review their light-duty programs with respect to pregnant women. #### "

Clayton Spencer as an executive assistant during summer 2012, wrote in her complaint that she was treated differently by Ms. Spencer than her male co-workers were, according to media reports. ####  ##### The lawsuit Ms. Hulbert filed with the Androscoggin County Superior Court on March 6, states that “the president of Bates College expected plaintiff, as a condition of her employment, to engage in activities with the president, such as running, tennis lessons and watching 'chick flicks,' which the president did not require of similarly situated male employees,” according to reports. ####  ##### View the Best Off Beat stories from March. ####  ##### A Bates spokesman told the Lewiston-Auburn Sun Journal that the college denies Ms. Hulbert's claims and expects to fight them. ####  ##### Ms. Hulbert, who said she was terminated on July 11, 2012, is seeking back pay, reinstatement or front pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and other costs and interests, reports state. ####  ##### It wasn't disclosed which chick flicks Ms. Hulbert was allegedly asked to watch with Ms. Spencer. #### "
"Race bias case reinstated of clerk accused of theft, falsely arrested";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a race discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a supermarket clerk, concluding he may have been framed for credit card theft and then falsely arrested after he complained about race discrimination. ####  ##### Sammy Perry, who began working as a night-shift stock clerk at Redner’s Market Inc. in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, in 2003, complained to then-assistant store director Brian Golden in April 2004 that African-American employees were having their hours cut, were being paid less than white employees and were being forced to work on weekends, according to Wednesday’s ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in Kayunta Johnson-Winters v. Redner’s Market Inc. Mr. Perry died in 2014, and the lawsuit was assumed by his daughter. ####  ##### Mr. Perry filed a race discrimination complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission in November 2004 and subsequently claimed he became subject to a pattern of antagonism, according to the ruling. ####  ##### A month later, he was injured at work and was out of work for 1½ years, returning in August 2006. Less than a month later, a woman reported to the local police that her credit card was missing and that she had last used it at the supermarket. The credit card was used at the same store the following day without authorization. ####  ##### The supermarket provided the police with a videotape that showed Mr. Perry at a store cash register 15 minutes after the credit card had been illegally used, according to the ruling. Mr. Perry was arrested for the theft and handcuffed at the store. He was also terminated, although whether it was at that time or subsequently is in dispute. ####  ##### Another store employee subsequently confessed she had used the credit card, and said she was repeatedly pressured by store employees to falsely say Mr. Perry was involved in the theft, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Perry filed suit, charging race discrimination and retaliation. The U.S. District Court in Philadelphia granted Redner’s summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### But a unanimous three-judge appeals panel vacated the summary judgment and remanded the case. “We believe there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether someone at Redner’s purposefully and maliciously identified Perry in connection with the unauthorized transactions,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “The record demonstrates that a reasonable jury could find, contrary to the district court’s ruling, that Redner’s purposefully gave police the wrong video footage so that the police would identify Perry as the perpetrator in an attempt to implicate him in the crime.” ####  ##### The ruling said Mr. Perry has provided “sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the alleged adverse actions were taken against him in retaliation for his previous complaints of race discrimination.” #### "
"Government had no right to take 80% in AIG bailout: Greenberg lawyer ";"Risk Management";"Regulation, Risk Management, AIG, General liability";" ##### WASHINGTON — The federal government did not have the authority to demand nearly 80% of American International Group Inc.’s equity in return for financial assistance during the 2008 financial crisis, an attorney for AIG investors, including former AIG chief Maurice R. Greenberg, told a federal judge Wednesday. ####  ##### In closing arguments before Judge Thomas Wheeler in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, David Boies said the section of the Federal Reserve Act under which AIG received the first $85 billion of what ultimately amounted to more than $180 billion in federal assistance — all of which has been repaid — never in its 75 years has required equity as compensation in return for financial guarantees, except in the case of AIG. ####  ##### Mr. Boies, who is chairman of law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner L.L.P. in Armonk, New York, said the government made a “political decision” to single out AIG as a scapegoat in the financial crisis. ####  ##### The plaintiffs in Starr International Co. v. United States allege that the government’s actions cost them billions of dollars in lost equity and are seeking to be repaid. ####  ##### The government countered that the plaintiffs suffered no harm. At the time AIG directors agreed to accept the $85 million loan in return for allowing the government to take a 79.9% stake in the company, all involved in the transaction agreed that the loan was preferable to bankruptcy, Justice Department attorney Kenneth Dintzer told Judge Wheeler. ####  ##### If the Federal Reserve, which approved the loan, “had wanted to harm AIG in some way, all it had to do was nothing,” he said, ####  ##### Mr. Dintzer said that without the loan, the value of AIG stock was “zero.” He added that “there never was an entitlement to a loan.” ####  ##### At the conclusion of the closing remarks, Judge Wheeler said “not surprisingly, just about everything in this case is still in dispute” and told the parties that he expected to issue a decision relatively soon. #### "

"Cocktail waitress' hostile work environment suit reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### An en banc appeals court has reinstated hostile work environment and retaliation charges filed by a terminated cocktail waitress who allegedly had been called a “porch monkey,” holding that a single incident of harassment, if bad enough, can be sufficient to pursue litigation. ####  ##### Reya C. Boyer-Liberto was hired by the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau Hotel in Ocean City, Maryland, in August 2010, according to Thursday's ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in Reya C. Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp. et al. ####  ##### Seven weeks later, in September 2010, Ms. Liberto carried a drink through the kitchen. A manager, Trudi Clubb, confronted her about taking it through the kitchen and calling her a “porch monkey,” Ms. Liberto claims. ####  ##### The next day, when Ms. Liberto went to the management office to report Ms. Clubb's conduct, Ms. Clubb pulled her out of the meeting and allegedly repeated the epithet, stating also, “I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna go” to the hotel owner, Dr. Leonard F. Berger to complain. ####  ##### The owner testified that in light of the racial harassment complaint, he inquired about Ms. Liberto's performance and fired her after receiving a negative evaluation. ####  ##### Ms. Liberto, who is African-American, filed suit in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, charging a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The District Court granted the hotel summary judgment, dismissing the case, an action subsequently affirmed by a divided 4th Circuit panel. ####  ##### The en banc appeals court reinstated both charges in a 12-3 opinion. ####  ##### “A reasonable jury could find that Clubb's two uses of the 'porch monkey' epithet — whether viewed as single incident or as a pair of discrete instances of harassment — were severe enough to engender a hostile work environment,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The court also reinstated the retaliation claim. ####  ##### Pointing to various U.S. Supreme Court rulings, it stated, “An employee is protected from retaliation for opposing an isolated incident of harassment when she reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in progress, with no requirement for additional evidence that a plan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment is likely to occur.” ####  ##### The ruling also said a jury could reject the hostile work environment claims while ruling in favor of the retaliation charge. #### "
"RSA buoyed by net premium boost as low rates, forex bite";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, United Kingdom, Financial Results";" ##### (Reuters) — British insurer RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. posted a 1% year-on-year rise in net written premiums in the first quarter, more than offsetting the impact of adverse interest rate and currency moves, and boosting its shares. ####  ##### The company, which provides personal and commercial general insurance, said it took in a net £1.5 billion ($2.27 billion) of premium income in the three months through March, with operating profit boosted by a series of disposals. ####  ##### Those disposals, including in Singapore and Hong Kong, are part of a recovery plan put in place by Chief Executive Stephen Hester after he was drafted in following an accounting scandal in Ireland and a series of profit warnings. ####  ##### The company, which swung to a profit in 2014, said in a statement on Thursday that net attributable profit was ""a little ahead"" of its plans and included anticipated gains from disposals. ####  ##### Tangible net asset value during the period, funds available to shareholders after intangible assets such as goodwill are stripped out, rose 3% to just shy of £3 billion ($4.54 billion), boosting tangible net asset value per share to 294 pence ($4.45). ####  ##### ""RSA made encouraging progress in Q1. Premium income returned to modest growth. Costs are falling as planned,"" Mr. Hester said in the statement, although ""lower interest rates and currency moves in our key territories continue to have adverse impacts, whilst insurance markets remain competitive."" ####  ##### Shares in RSA rose 2.4% in early dealings against a 0.7% fall in the broader U.K. stock market. ####  ##### Mr. Hester said pricing had held up well in Scandinavia, where market conditions remained relatively stable, while pricing in Canada was more mixed, with improved conditions in personal household insurance offset by weakness elsewhere. ####  ##### In its core U.K. market, meanwhile, pricing remained soft across all major lines of business. ####  ##### The company said foreign exchange movements continued to hit its results, given sterling had risen against all its major currency exposures. ####  ##### Interest rates, meanwhile, had fallen across its major markets, hitting the reinvestment rate on its bond portfolio, although it said it was still on track to deliver £380 million ($575.4 million) of income in 2015. ####  ##### Five-year government debt yields in Sweden and Denmark were down 10 basis points and 30 points, respectively, in the first quarter, while in Canada, yields fell 50 points. ####  ##### The impact of reduced investment income has been raised by other insurers during the current earnings season including Prudential P.L.C., where it contributed to a drop in new business profit. ####  ##### RSA said its preparation for new European solvency rules was on course, and capital ratios were up slightly compared with the year-end, in line with its expectations. #### "

"FAA partners with BNSF Railway, PrecisionHawk on drones";"Risk Management";"Emerging Risks, Aviation";" ##### (Reuters) — The Federal Aviation Administration announced industry partnerships on Wednesday to test commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's line of sight, seen as a necessary precursor to autonomous drone operations such as package delivery. ####  ##### The partnership include U.S. drone maker PrecisionHawk, which will test applications for surveying crops in rural areas, and BNSF Railway Co., owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which will use drones to inspect rail infrastructure in isolated areas. ####  ##### A third partnership between the FAA and CNN will enable the cable television news network to test newsgathering in urban areas with drones that would remain visible to operators. ####  ##### ""We anticipate receiving valuable data from each of these trials that could result in FAA-approved operations in the next few years,"" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said. ####  ##### ""They will also give insight into how unmanned aircraft can be used to transform the way certain industries do business — whether that means making sure trains run on time, checking on the health of crops, or reporting on a natural disaster."" ####  ##### The news raised the odds that beyond-visual-line-of-sight, or BVLOS, technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years. ####  ##### The proposed FAA rules unveiled in February would lift the current near-ban on commercial drones. But the proposals, as written, still would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by e-commerce company Amazon.com because they require drones to remain within an operator's visual line of sight as a safety measure. #### "

"Black steelworkers certified for promotions bias class action";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Black workers at a South Carolina steel plant are entitled to class certification on their job promotion claims, says a U.S. appeals court in overturning a federal court ruling on the issue for the second time. ####  ##### At the start of the complex litigation in 2004, there were 71 black workers out of a total of 611 employees in the Huger, South Carolina, steel plant operated by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor Corp. and Nucor Steel-Berkeley, but only one black supervisor, according to Monday’s ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in Quinton Brown et al. v. Nucor Corp.; Nucor Steel-Berkeley. ####  ##### Plaintiffs in the case sought class certification for discriminatory job promotion practices and a racially hostile work environment. In 2007, the U.S. District Court in Charleston, South Carolina, denied the workers’ motion for class certification on both charges. In 2009, the 4th Circuit reversed that ruling, calling for certification on both charges. ####  ##### In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a proposed class of about 1.5 million members in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Betty Dukes et al. Citing that ruling, the District Court decertified the job promotions class but not the hostile work environment class. ####  ##### In its ruling Monday, the appeals court once again reinstated the job promotions class certification. ####  ##### The promotions system at the plant “requiring approvals from different levels of management, created an environment in which the discriminatory exercise of discretion by one department head harmed the promotions opportunities for all black workers at the plant by foreclosing on opportunities in that department and generally impeding upward mobility,” said the 63-page majority ruling. It said the District Court had “fundamentally misapprehended the reach of Wal-Mart and its application to the workers’ promotions class.” ####  ##### “At bottom, the workers seek nothing more than the chance to speak with one voice about the promotions discrimination they allegedly suffered as one class on account of one uniting feature: the color of their skin,” said the appeals court in remanding the case to the District Court with instructions to certify the class. #### "
"Pool Re modernization efforts on track ";"Risk Management";"Regulation, Risk Management, Terrorism, United Kingdom";" ##### Pool Reinsurance Co.

In addition, the pool will grant discounts for deductibles of between £500,000 and £1 million ($768,750 and $1.5 million), it said. ####  ##### For loss limits in excess of £500 million ($768.8 million), Pool Re said it will consider rate discounts for locations where insured values are at least 20% more than the limit. ####  ##### Pool Re also said it would begin to introduce revised rates that “are more reflective of the underlying risk and are based on modern modeling techniques.” ####  ##### The revisions will reflect the changes to terrorism risk and exposures in the 12 years since the rating was last reviewed, Pool Re said. ####  ##### “The scheme must evolve in tandem with the shifting threat facing businesses across the United Kingdom,” Julian Enoizi, CEO of Pool Re, said in the statement. ####  ##### “This is a continuous process which can only be achieved through extensive collaborative discussion with our members and stakeholders,” he said. “Today’s announcement represents the culmination of the first stage of a process which will see Pool Re continue to look to enhance its offering.”. ####  ##### Pool Re was set up in 1993 by the U.K. government and insurance industry, and its members include most insurers and Lloyd’s of London syndicates that offer commercial property insurance in the United Kingdom. #### "

"One-eyed oil rig worker wins disability ruling ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, Disability, General liability";" ##### A federal judge has ordered an oil drilling company to pay $245,600 to an Alaskan oil rig worker who is blind in one eye for refusing to hire him, following an eight-day trial, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday. ####  ##### The agency said Houston-based Parker Drilling Co. withdrew a job offer to Kevin McDowell, an experienced oil rig worker, in 2010 because he had no vision in his left eye. ####  ##### The EEOC said Mr. McDowell had lost his sight in the eye as a child, and had never found it a hindrance during a 37-year career working various positions on the oil rig floor. ####  ##### The agency said Mr. McDowell had previously worked at Parker Drilling from 1978-1982, but after offering him a job in January 2010, the company withdrew the offer, stating his monocular vision disqualified him for the position. ####  ##### The EEOC charged Parker with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. A jury in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, Alaska, found the company liable and awarded Mr. McDowell $15,000 in compensatory damages for emotional pain and distress. U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason then ordered the company to pay another $230,600 in back pay. ####  ##### “This is the first EEOC case ever to go to trial in Alaska,” EEOC San Francisco Regional Attorney William R.

And the Office of Personnel Management breach revealed Thursday suggests cyber spies may now also be finding value in it. ####  ##### Cyber investigators from iSight Partners Inc. said they had linked the OPM hack to earlier thefts of health care records from Anthem Inc., a health insurer, and Premera Blue Cross, a health care services provider. Tens of millions of records may have been lost in those attacks. ####  ##### All three breaches have one thing in common, said John Hultquist of Dallas-based iSight. While cyber espionage usually focuses on stealing commercial or government secrets, these attacks targeted personally identifiable information. ####  ##### The stolen data ""doesn't appear to have been monetized, and the actors seem to have connections to cyber espionage activity"", said Mr. Hultquist, adding that none of the data taken in the earlier attacks had turned up for sale on underground forums. ####  ##### A source close the matter said U.S. authorities were looking into a possible China connection to the breach at OPM, which compromised the personal data of 4 million current and former federal employees. ####  ##### Several U.S. states were already investigating a Chinese link to the Anthem attack in February, a person familiar with the matter has said. ####  ##### China routinely denies involvement in hacking, and on Friday a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing said suggestions it was involved in the OPM breach were ""irresponsible and unscientific."" ####  ##### Mr. Hultquist said iSight could not confirm that China was behind the attacks, but similar methods, servers and habits of the hackers pointed to a single state-sponsored group. ####  ##### Black market flooded ####  ##### Security researchers say medical data and personnel records have become more valuable to cyber criminals than credit card data. ####  ##### The price of stolen credit cards has fallen in online black markets, in part because massive breaches have spiked supply. ####  ##### ""The market has been flooded,"" said Ben Ransford, co-founder of security startup Virta Laboratories Inc. ####  ##### The result: Medical information can be worth 10 times as much as a credit card number. ####  ##### Fraudsters use this data to create fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or they combine a patient number with a false provider number and file made-up claims with insurers. ####  ##### State-sponsored hackers may not be after money, but would also be interested in such data because they could then build a clearer picture of their target. ####  ##### That, said Philip Lieberman of security software company Lieberman Software Inc., would increase the chances of any targeted email attack, or spear phish, successfully obtaining confidential data. ####  ##### Others said that, given the data affected includes job histories, those targets might be in other government departments. ""It's likely this is less about money and more about gaining deeper access to other systems and agencies,"" said Mark Bower of HP Security Voltage, a data security company. ####  ##### This interest in more granular data is pushing hackers of all stripes into more inventive ways of penetrating the defenses of hospitals and other institutions holding such data. ####  ##### TrapX Security, a cyber security company, said it had discovered criminal gangs from Russia and China infecting medical devices such as X-Ray systems and blood gas analyzers to find their way into servers from which they stole personnel and patient data. ####  ##### Other security researchers agreed this kind of attack was becoming more common. ####  ##### Billy Rios, founder of security company Laconicly L.L.C., said he had found infected systems while working with several health care organizations. ""Clinical software is riddled with security vulnerabilities,"" he said. ####  ##### A survey by think-tank The Ponemon Institute L.L.C. issued last month said that more than 90% of health care organizations surveyed had lost data, most of it to hackers. ####  ##### ""This is going to get worse before it gets better,"" said Carl Wright, of TrapX, which discovered the breaches via medical devices. #### "
"EEOC charges bread baking firm with ignoring race bias";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management";" ##### An Illinois bread company has been charged by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with permitting a pattern of disparaging comments against black employees in its Aurora, Illinois, baking facility. ####  ##### The agency said Wednesday that Schaumburg, Illinois-based Gonnella Baking Co., which is being charged with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, did little or nothing to respond to repeated complaints about harassment directed at black employees. ####  ##### The agency said the harassment included frequent and derogatory comments.. ####  ##### “Employers who know about discriminatory harassment of their employees are responsible for stopping it,” said John Hendrickson, the EEOC's regional attorney in Chicago, in a statement. “Racial comments and stereotypes have no place in a modern workplace, and the EEOC will hold employers accountable for that misconduct.” ####  ##### A company spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### In November, a federal district judge entered a $735,000 consent decree resolving a race harassment lawsuit, in which the EEOC charged a Chicago grocery wholesaler with tolerating a racially hostile workplace. #### "

We encourage employers to effectively investigate complaints and recognize color discrimination.” ####  ##### The hotel’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Berkshire most exposed to asbestos losses";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, Berkshire Hathaway, Financial Results, Claims Management";" ##### U.S. property/casualty insurers' asbestos reserves were deficient by $5 billion to $12 billion as of year-end 2014, with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. being most exposed, Fitch Ratings Inc. said in a report issued Tuesday. ####  ##### Industry asbestos reserves now total $22 billion, representing about 4% of industry loss reserves, according to the Chicago-based rating agency's Asbestos Reserves Dashboard: 2015 report. ####  ##### The agency said it has increased its maximum estimate of ultimate industry insured losses for asbestos exposures to $90 billion as of year-end 2014 from a previous estimate of $85 billion. ####  ##### It said incurred losses continue to materialize, tied partly to mesothelioma claims and rising legal defense costs, which have been only partially offset by a reduction in new claims filings. ####  ##### The report said Fitch expects asbestos reserves to continue to “bleed through” insurers' and reinsurers' earnings, rather than “resulting in severe capital shocks.” ####  ##### “Industry practice remains largely to strengthen reserves as claims are paid, thereby keeping reserve levels relatively flat. The earnings drag from asbestos losses for insurers with the greatest exposure has averaged almost 1 percentage point to the group's combined ratio over the past five years,” says the report. ####  ##### Fitch said in its 2014 U.S. Asbestos Liability Dashboard that it estimates U.S. property/casualty industry statutory asbestos reserves to be deficient by $2 billion to $9 billion at year-end 2013. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway has the most asbestos reserves of all companies, with about $14 billion, according to the report. But it has assumed $12 billion of asbestos losses through reinsurance transactions, according to the report. ####  ##### A spokesman for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "

"Financier ordered to pay $18 million in harassment case";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### (Reuters) — A federal jury on Monday ordered the CEO of a Manhattan investment firm to pay $18 million in damages to a former employee for sexual harassment and defamation. ####  ##### Benjamin Wey, who heads up New York Global Group, was accused of using his power to coerce Hanna Bouveng, 25, into having sex, firing her when she refused further advances and then ruining her reputation with a series of offensive blog posts that called her, among other things, a ""street walker."" ####  ##### The two-week civil trial in New York drew lurid headlines from the city's tabloids, pitting a young Swedish woman against a Wall Street financier 20 years her senior. ####  ##### Jurors found in Ms. Bouveng's favor on sexual harassment, retaliation and defamation claims but rejected her allegations of assault and battery. ####  ##### The jury awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and $16 million in punitive damages, mostly for defamation, from Mr. Wey, NYGG and its FNL Media subsidiary. Ms. Bouveng's lawsuit had sought $850 million. ####  ##### Lawyers for Mr. Wey declined to comment on the verdict, saying they would consider his legal options. ####  ##### David Ratner, Ms. Bouveng's lawyer, said she was ""extraordinarily relieved that this ordeal that he has put her through is finally over."" ####  ##### During the trial, Mr. Ratner told jurors that Ms. Bouveng's ""dream"" was to work on Wall Street. He said Mr. Wey conducted a ""relentless campaign"" of harassment after hiring Ms. Bouveng in 2013 to run his firm's marketing efforts, buying her gifts and demanding sexual favors in return. ####  ##### Mr. Wey's actions led to a two-minute sexual encounter in her apartment that left her feeling ""degraded,"" Mr. Ratner said. The two would have sex three more times before Ms. Bouveng rejected further attempts, the lawyer said. ####  ##### In April 2014, Mr. Wey discovered another man in Ms. Bouveng's apartment, which he was helping to finance, and fired her in retaliation, Mr. Ratner said. After she filed the lawsuit, he then wrote a series of disparaging articles in an online publication controlled by FNL Media. ####  ##### Mr. Wey's lawyer, Glenn Colton, countered that the two never had sex and that Ms. Bouveng attempted to extort him after she was fired for substandard work. ####  ##### Ms. Bouveng, Mr. Colton told jurors, torpedoed her career by spending too much time enjoying the city's nightlife and not enough on learning how to do her job. ####  ##### NYGG has access to about $1 billion in investment capital, according to its website. ####  ##### The case is Bouveng v.

"Lloyd's cyber study reveals insurers' aggregation risks ";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Terrorism, Lloyd's of London, Energy";" ##### A coordinated cyber attack on the U.S. power grid could cause large, but manageable, losses of about $21 billion for the insurance industry, according to a study published Wednesday that addresses the risks of aggregation. ####  ##### An attack whereby hackers shut down parts of the grid, leaving 15 U.S. states and Washington without power, could cause economic losses of about $243 million — or as much as $1 trillion in the most extreme scenario — and impact a broad range of insurance coverages, according to the report, “Business Blackout: the insurance implications of a cyber attack on the U.S. power grid” produced by the Centre for Risk Studies at Cambridge University in conjunction with Lloyd's of London. ####  ##### Such an attack, stemming from fires in power generators caused by a cyber attack, likely would impact about 32 lines of insurance, said Andrew Coburn, director of the advisory board of the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies and senior vice president at catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc. in London. ####  ##### The main drivers of insurance losses would be the property damage at the generators themselves, business interruption losses from companies that lose power and contingent business interruption losses for companies that trade with those that lose power. ####  ##### Other major areas of insured losses likely would include incident response costs, fines, liability, perishable contents, household contents and event cancellation, he said. ####  ##### There would be several areas of potential coverage dispute arising from the scenario, Mr. Coburn said, including peril definition and attribution — who caused the loss and why, the territorial distance of limits for insured sites, and deductibles for the duration of the event. ####  ##### The potential losses “are not limited to affirmative cyber coverages,” Mr. Coburn said, and there are areas of ambiguity and “silent coverages” that could potentially be damaging for some insurers. ####  ##### “It is to everyone's advantage to be clear about what is covered and what is not,” he said. ####  ##### Tom Bolt, director of performance management at Lloyd's, said the report had been commissioned, in part, to give Lloyd's greater insight into possible loss aggregations from a major cyber event. ####  ##### “We think we should be insuring cyber, but we think it is incredibly important to understand the aggregation of risk,” said Mr. Bolt, who said that he was worried about how to protect the Lloyd's Central Fund, which covers syndicates that are unable to meet their liabilities, from the actions of a “kid in a bedroom somewhere.” ####  ##### Mr. Bolt urged underwriters and insurance buyers to share information about cyber attacks in order to build up greater knowledge about how to price risks as well as potential aggregation of risk. ####  ##### A cyber attack that affected several industry segments could cause aggregation vulnerabilities and threaten some insurers' solvency, for example, he said. ####  ##### “We want to make sure that is not a risk we take,” he said. #### "

"EEOC charges Wal-Mart over disability bias against worker with bone cancer";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Disability";" ##### The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is charging Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with disability discrimination and harassment for allegedly refusing to set up a chair for an associate suffering from bone cancer. ####  ##### The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said it denies the EEOC's “misleading” charges. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement last week that Wal-Mart initially agreed to comply with a request by Nancy Stack, who worked in its Hodgkins, Illinois, store, that the company provide a chair in her work area in the fitting room and limit her scheduled work hours because treatment for bone cancer in her leg limited her ability to work and stand. ####  ##### But, after complying with her scheduling accommodation for many months, the store revoked it “for no reason,” said the agency, in a statement issued last week. ####  ##### Furthermore, said the agency, the store did not ensure that a chair was in Ms. Stack's work area, “at one point telling her that she had to haul a chair from the furniture department every day, which was of course hard for her to do given her disability.” ####  ##### The EEOC said also that the store then transferred Ms. Stack from the fitting room to a greeter position, which did not comply with her standing restrictions. ####  ##### In addition, it said a co-worker harassed Ms. Stock by calling her names, imitating her limp, and removing or hiding the chair she needed, and that the store took no action in response to her complaints. ####  ##### The EEOC is charging Wal-Mart with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### “It's hard to believe a retailer the size of Wal-Mart could not manage to consistently provide such a simple accommodation as a chair,” said John Hendrickson, regional attorney for EEOC's Chicago district office, in a statement. ####  ##### “Telling a disabled employee that she needs to drag a chair across the store every day is no accommodation at all. Employers have to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so would be an undue hardship. EEOC is aware of no hardship that required Wal-Mart to suddenly change Stack's schedule, deny her the use of a chair, and transfer her out of the fitting room where she had performed her job well for years.” ####  ##### A Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement, “We strongly disagree with the allegations raised in the complaint. Wal-Mart does not condone or tolerate discrimination of any kind, and our company has thousands of associates who perform their jobs with reasonable accommodations that we have provided. ####  ##### “Ms. Stack is a current Wal-Mart associate, and for years we have provided her a reasonable accommodation to assist her in performing essential job duties. We intend to defend the company against the EEOC's misleading claims.” #### "

"United Airlines flight attendant's race bias case reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### United Airlines Inc. failed to adequately respond to death threats received by a black airline attendant, said an appeals court in overturning a lower court ruling and reinstating her hostile work environment claim. ####  ##### Renee Pryor, who joined Chicago-based United in 1984, discovered a note in her mailbox in the Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, in 2011 claiming to be a hunting license to hunt and kill black people that had a racial epithet and included a hand-drawn image of a person hanging from a pole or tree, according to Wednesday's ruling by the 4th U.S. District Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia in Renee Pryor v. United Air Lines Inc. ####  ##### Despite her complaints to company officials, Ms. Pryor wound up having to file complaints herself with the police and the airline's employee service center, according to the ruling. Eventually, United Airlines conducted an investigation and concluded it could not identify a suspect. ####  ##### Ms. Pryor receiving a subsequent note, and other black airline attendants received similar notes and were subjected to racist rumors and breakroom postings, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Pryor relocated to George Bush International Airport in Houston, where she has not reported any further race-related incidents. ####  ##### In March 2012, Ms. Pryor filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging that United's failure to adequately investigate the rumors and racist notes left in her mailbox constituted unlawful discrimination. ####  ##### After receiving a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Ms. Pryor filed suit in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, charging the airline with race discrimination and a hostile work environment. ####  ##### The District Court dismissed the case, concluding that while Ms. Pryor had been subject to a racially hostile work environment, the airline was not liable for the offensive conduct. ####  ##### The three-judge appeals court panel agreed Ms. Pryor had been subject to a hostile work environment and reinstated the case. ####  ##### “It bears emphasizing that an employer's response need not be perfect, or even embody best practices, to be reasonably calculated to end harassing conduct,” said the ruling. ####  ##### But “a reasonable jury could conclude that the response United actually chose was neither prompt nor reasonably calculated. ####  ##### “Indeed, a reasonable jury could find that United's response was instead reluctant and reactive, intended to minimize any disruption to day-to-day operations instead of identifying a perpetrator and deterring future harassment,” said the appeals panel in reinstating the case. ####  ##### Last year, a U.S. District Judge entered a $735,000 consent decree resolving a race harassment lawsuit, in which the EEOC charged a Chicago grocery wholesaler with tolerating a racially hostile workplace. #### "

"Drone flights present risks, rewards";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Aviation";" ##### The first commercial drone package delivery approved by the Federal Aviation Administration has caught the attention of risk managers, brokers and insurers. ####  ##### Aviation brokers and underwriters see insuring drones as an opportunity, but the latest technology also poses risks such as pilot error and product liability. Risk managers already see drones, the common term for unmanned aerial vehicles, among their top risks. ####  ##### On Friday in Wise County, Virginia, the first FAA-approved drone package delivery service carried medical supplies to a remote medical clinic where volunteers provided medical care to residents in the poverty-stricken area of Appalachia. ####  ##### “Access is a challenge. Some of the people live on top of mountains with no access to medical care. I don't believe people are as aware that we have issues like this in the U.S. They see it in other countries, but it is here as well,” said Rose Mooney, Baltimore, Maryland-based executive director of Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership at Virginia Tech, which co-sponsored the delivery with NASA via the drone that was covered by an undisclosed insurer. ####  ##### “This is opening up a whole new area in the United States,” Ms. Mooney said. “There are a lot of safety and logistical issues that our research at FAA-designated test sites is addressing.” ####  ##### While the FAA recently issued rules for the personal operation of drones, it may be another year or so before it issues rules for commercial drone operators. It has, however, already granted more than 700 exemptions to commercial operators. ####  ##### “These exemptions are granted on a case-by-case basis because there's currently a prohibition on commercial unmanned aerial systems use in the U.S,” said a spokesman for the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International based in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Insurance buyers' interest has soared. ####  ##### “We have seen a 100-fold increase in commercial insurance requests in just over 90 days. We are handling 150 submissions for insurance a week,” said Terry Miller, president of Conifer, Colorado-based Transport Risk Management Inc. ####  ##### The aviation brokerage provides manufacturer, owner and operator coverage for nearly every type of commercial drone, from those that patrol power lines and agricultural fields to those that survey damage after a catastrophe. ####  ##### “We see media looking into it, film news coverage, we are seeing energy and infrastructure looking into drone insurance, real estate companies,” said Patton Kline, Marsh USA Inc.'s New York-based senior vice president of aviation and space. “There is a huge spectrum of companies and industries looking into it because it is more cost-effective to operate (unmanned aerial vehicles) than typical aircraft, and they're looking for insurance at the same time.” ####  ##### Drones are on risk managers' radar as well. ####  ##### In an April survey by the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc., risk managers ranked drones as being among their three top emerging casualty risks, along with cyber security and product recalls. ####  ##### As far as insurance offered to cover commercial drones, Mr. Miller said the coverage includes up to $100 million in third-party liability limits and up to $10 million in hull physical damage limits. With about 2,700 commercial drones insured, there have been about 30 hull physical damage claims, but no liability claims yet, he said. ####  ##### “The insurance policy is a helicopter policy, more or less, but since it does not have an airworthiness certificate, we re-define it as a UAV. We look at aircraft type, aircraft use and the pilot to see if it will be an insurable risk,” Mr. Miller said. “One of the largest causes of crashes has been pilot error,” he said. ####  ##### Marsh's Mr. Kline agrees. ####  ##### “From a liability standpoint, pilot error will remain a risk,” Mr. Kline said. “Underwriters typically have a list of pilot requirements. It's a little bit like typical aviation insurance for pilots; the underwriters want to see something similar for drone pilots.” ####  ##### “We think there will be a fair amount of product liability associated with drone use, and we are working with our clients to avoid that risk,” he said. “A lot of people are focused on the operations, but we are also focused on the product's liability, and we see that as something that should be a concern in the industry.” ####  ##### Should a faulty component cause a drone accident, “it's very easy to go after the operator. But if they don't have deep pockets and if the deep pockets are with the manufacturer, then that is something that should be a concern to people in the business,” Mr. Kline said. ####  ##### However, the unmanned vehicle association argues that drones “could actually reduce liability concerns by making traditionally dangerous tasks, such as bridge, power line and cell tower inspections, safer and more efficient,” the spokesman said. ####  ##### “If a drone is operated properly, it takes out a significant exposure factor,” said Peter Schmitz, New York-based CEO of Aon Risk Solutions' global aviation specialty practice. ####  ##### As the number of drone users increases, so do the incidents of drones being flown into restricted areas, such as over fires or airports, that could put pilots of standard aircraft at risk. ####  ##### From an insurance industry standpoint, Mr. Schmitz feels drones are a good thing “as long as it's not something that gets tarnished by the enthusiastic amateur. That's the issue the FAA is struggling with right now.” #### "
"Ace, XL prepare to address challenges of growth";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Ace, Mergers & Acquisitions, XL Catlin";" ##### Ace Ltd. and XL Group P.L.C., born of the mid-1980s liability crisis, have become successful global players largely through acquisitions, though they face several challenges resulting from their latest purchases. ####  ##### Ace Ltd., formed in 1985, and XL Group P.L.C., originally EXEL Ltd. when established in 1986, began as policyholder-owned facilities to offer excess liability and directors and officers liability coverage. ####  ##### They also helped jumpstart the alternative Bermuda market. ####  ##### Now public companies, both are growing thanks to major acquisitions. ####  ##### Ace earlier this month announced a $28.3 billion deal to buy Chubb Corp. Ace's earlier purchases include Corporate Officers & Directors Assurance Ltd. in 1993; Tempest Reinsurance Co. Ltd. in 1996; and Cigna Corp.'s global property/casualty business in 1999, which gave the insurer an international platform. ####  ##### XL boosted its market share most recently with the $4.28 billion deal in May to acquire Catlin Group Ltd. Earlier purchases include property catastrophe reinsurer GCR Holdings Ltd., the holding company for Global Capital Reinsurance Ltd., in 1997; Mid-Ocean Reinsurance Ltd. in 1998; and Winterthur International in 2001. In 1999, XL merged with NAC Re Corp. ####  ##### Both also have acquired a significant presence at Lloyd's of London. With the purchase of Catlin, XL owns the market's largest syndicate, syndicate 2003 that provides more than 30 lines of coverage. ####  ##### Ace and XL have been largely successful, said Jim Auden, managing director of insurance at Fitch Ratings Inc. in Chicago. ####  ##### When the liability crisis ended, the companies “had very good results and made money and retained that capital, and that allowed them to take advantage of other opportunities down the road,” Mr. Auden said. ####  ##### “They came in without a lot of legacy issues in terms of culture and with fresh management and I think, as a result, they were able to be more nimble” than other insurers, said John Wicher, principal at John A. Wicher & Associates Inc. in San Francisco. “With the appropriate safeguards in place, they have not been afraid to be aggressive and to reach out for growth.” ####  ##### Still, they have stumbled along the way. ####  ##### XL acquired legacy liability exposures with NAC Re and Winterthur that led to more than $1 billion in charges and reserve increases in 2004 and 2005. ####  ##### Ace managed its exposure to past-year liability losses from Cigna's property/casualty business through a then-innovative reinsurance deal with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The deal involved Cigna establishing a separately capitalized runoff entity, which purchased reinsurance from Berkshire. ####  ##### But it ran into trouble when it was one of several insurers caught up in bid-rigging allegations by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the resolution of which cost Ace more than $80 million in various states. ####  ##### In addition to having strong management teams, “each of these companies has demonstrated an ability to maintain a very clear vision in terms of maintaining strong (returns on equity), only doing deals that make sense,” said Robert Hartwig, president of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute Inc. ####  ##### “Even though they stand true to their own vision and they're disciplined, they're still receptive to the risk manager's needs,” said Carolyn Snow, director of risk management at Louisville, Kentucky-based health care provider Humana Inc. ####  ##### Both are “pretty good at paying attention to their customer, making sure the customer does get their claims paid on a timely and accurate basis as needed,” said William M. Zachry, vice president of risk management at grocery store chain Safeway Inc. in Pleasanton, California. ####  ##### Ace and XL have “developed the insight and expertise to write high-exposure, primary business,” said Warren Mula, CEO of Aon Risk Solutions' retail broking unit in Chicago. ####  ##### “When you consider how many carriers are in existence today that truly write primary global property and casualty business, there's not all that many,” he said, saying there are about five to six such insurers. ####  ##### Integrating Chubb and Catlin will be a challenge, but “I think they'll come out fine,” said Safeway's Mr. Zachry. ####  ##### Ace and XL face the complexity of managing operations and risk worldwide, with different regulatory regimes, capital demands and competitive environments, said Alan Murray, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service in New York. ####  ##### “It's easier to be entrepreneurial when you're smaller. When you become bigger, it's more difficult to stay entrepreneurial” and continue to have success, said Rob Yellen, New York-based executive vice president of Finex North America, a unit of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. ####  ##### “Are they going to be able to continue? I think they will,” said Mr. Yellen. While it does not mean there will not be bumps in the road “they're on the right track.” #### "
"Broker M&A deals set record pace in first half";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### Private equity-backed buyers again dominated mergers and acquisitions of insurance agents and brokers during the record-setting first half of 2015. ####  ##### There were 224 announced transactions in the U.S. and Canada during the first six months of the year, 29% more than the same period last year and 22% higher than the previous six-month record period in the second half of last year. ####  ##### With 110 transactions, private equity-backed buyers accounted for 49% of the total and represented eight of the 10 most active first-half buyers. ####  ##### Privately owned buyers were a distant No. 2 with 61 deals. ####  ##### There were 99 unique buyers in 2015, an increase of more than 20 over the same period in 2014 and 2013, with 11 announcing five or more deals vs. eight during the first half of 2014 and 2013. ####  ##### Private equity-backed firms Acrisure L.L.C., AssuredPartners Inc. and Hub International Ltd. led the first-half buyer list, each with 17 deals. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. was next with 15. BroadStreet Partners Inc. and Confie Seguros Insurance Services each had 11 transactions. ####  ##### Overall, agent and broker M&As have grown steadily since the trough in mid-2013, when quarterly transactions totaled 50 to 60. But over the past eight quarters, four have had more than 90 transactions. And the past three quarters have had more than 100 deals apiece. ####  ##### For the 12-month period ended in June, there were 407 deals announced, a 14% rise over 2014. ####  ##### Each of the buyer groups, except those that are publicly owned, increased their M&A activity during the first half of this year. Private equity-backed firms announced 42 more transactions this year than last year, a 59% increase. The private equity-backed group represented more than 80% of the total year-over-year growth in announced deals. ####  ##### Privately owned agencies also continued their record-setting pace, besting their previous high of 60 acquisitions last year at this time with 61 announced through the first half of this year. But publicly held brokers saw a decline to 26 during the first half of 2015 from 28 transactions in the first half of 2014, primarily due to reduced activity by Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C. ####  ##### Agents and brokers specializing in property/casualty coverage continue to be the primary acquisition targets, with nearly 60% of all deals this year involving them vs. 40% to 45% during 2012-2014. ####  ##### The 224 reported deals this year do not include international acquisitions or recapitalizations by private equity-backed firms. The late June merger of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. and Towers Watson & Co. also is excluded, since Willis is based in London. ####  ##### There also were several changes among private equity players. Most notably, Stone Point Capital L.L.C. took a stake in Alliant Insurance Services Inc., supplanting rival investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. as the largest institutional investor in Alliant; and ABRY Partners invested in The Hilb Group L.L.C., a deal in which BHMS Investments L.P. exited the business. ####  ##### Additionally, several of this year's top 100 brokers of U.S. business were sold this year. They include No. 50 MHBT Inc. and No. 90 J.W. Terrill Inc., which Marsh & McLennan Agency purchased; and No. 86 Cook Maran & Associates Inc., which Prime Risk Partners Inc. bought. ####  ##### Looking to the balance of 2015 and beyond, there will likely be a slowdown in activity and pricing aggressiveness as the overall market returns to some degree of normality, but not yet. ####  ##### Timothy J.

"Hospital firing of tardy nurse justified by lack of FMLA communication";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### A hospital was justified in firing a nurse who was two minutes late for her shift because she had failed to inform her employer she was taking intermittent Family Medical Leave Act leave, says a federal appeals court in upholding dismissal of an FMLA case. ####  ##### Kathleen Norton worked at Bay City, Michigan-based McLaren Bay Special Care, an acute long-term care hospital, for about 17 years, according to Wednesday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Kathleen Norton v. LTCH dba McLaren Bay Special Care et al. ####  ##### In early 2013, Ms. Norton received three written reprimands for excessive absenteeism and tardiness, which was defined as clocking in more than one minute late for a scheduled shift, and understood she risked losing her job if she committed additional infractions, according to the ruling. ####  ##### In May 2013, Ms. Norton began to suffer “vestibular” migraines, experiencing symptoms such as extreme dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, headaches and sensitivity to light, according to the ruling. ####  ##### After her condition prevented her from working for two weeks, she applied for and received intermittent FMLA leave, but was still required to call the hospital's family leave call center at least two hours before her scheduled shift before taking time off. Ms. Norton called the center at least once in June or July, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Norton arrived two minutes late for her July 14 shift without calling the call center in advance and claimed she was unable to anticipate her late arrival, according to the ruling. She said she was suffering from symptoms caused by her condition, but did not discuss this with a manager or human resources representative. ####  ##### At a July 18 meeting, she said she was late because she was waiting for a babysitter to arrive, according to notes taken by a hospital consultant. She was terminated at the end of that meeting. ####  ##### Ms. Norton filed suit, charging the hospital had interfered with the exercise of her FMLA rights and retaliation. The U.S. District Court in Bay City granted the hospital summary judgment dismissing the case, and a three-judge panel unanimously upheld that ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Norton's “silence on and after July 14 deprived (the hospital) of an adequate basis for determining whether the FMLA covered her late arrival,” said the unanimous three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit in dismissing the interference charge. In dismissing the retaliation charge, the ruling said Ms. Norton cannot show that the hospital “applied its attendance and disciplinary policies selectively.” ####  ##### Last year, a federal court refused to dismiss an FMLA violation claim by a Boeing Co. employee who was terminated after she attempted to take FMLA leave for her migraines, stating there is evidence the company discriminated against her. #### "

"Sirius XM will settle unpaid intern lawsuit for $1.3 million";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Sirius XM Radio Inc. has agreed to pay up to $1.3 million to settle claims that it violated U.S. labor laws by not paying interns, making the satellite radio provider the latest large company to settle such a case. ####  ##### Sirius said in court papers filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan that it still believed the unpaid intern program was legal, but that it would pay the money to more than 1,800 former interns to avoid costly litigation. ####  ##### A company representative could not immediately be reached for further comment. A lawyer for the former interns also could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### The plaintiffs, who worked on the Howard Stern Show and other Sirius projects, claimed they worked up to 40 hours per week and were not paid, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York state's minimum wage law. ####  ##### The primary test used by courts in such cases is whether internships were designed primarily to educate young people in a particular field, as opposed to companies using unpaid workers for the same tasks performed by regular employees. ####  ##### The proposed settlement by Sirius, which must be approved by a judge, was announced a month after rulings by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. In cases against Fox Searchlight Pictures Inc. and The Hearst Corp., the appeals court said unpaid internships were legal when they were closely tied to interns' educations. ####  ##### The Fox case, which was filed in 2013, spurred many similar lawsuits. Warner Music Group Corp. in June agreed to pay more than $4.2 million to hundreds of interns, following even larger settlements by Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, Conde Nast and Viacom Inc. #### "

"Ace liable for Abercrombie defense in gift card litigation ";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Ace, Claims Disputes, General liability";" ##### An Ace Ltd. unit is obligated to defend retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. in connection with three pending class action lawsuits stemming from a promotion, an appeals court ruled. ####  ##### New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie gave a $25 gift card to customers who had purchased either $75 or $100 worth of goods during the 2009 holiday season, according to Thursday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati in Ace European Group Ltd. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ####  ##### Although Abercrombie refused to honor the cards after Jan. 30, 2010, some of the gift card had the phrase “no expiration date” printed on the surface, and others had no expiration date. ####  ##### Abercrombie customers filed three class action lawsuits still pending in Illinois, California and Ohio claiming customer fraud stemming from the retailer's refusal to honor the cards and breach of contract. ####  ##### Abercrombie, which had purchased an “advertisers and Internet liability” policy from Ace unit Ace European Group Ltd. in September 2009, requested that the insurer defend it in the litigation, but the insurer refused, stating the subject matter fell outside its policy's coverage. ####  ##### Abercrombie sued Ace for breach of contract and related claims, while Ace sought a declaratory judgment stating it was not obligated to provide coverage. ####  ##### The U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, ruled the insurer was obligated for defense costs, and the 6th Circuit's three-judge appellate panel agreed in a unanimous ruling. ####  ##### According to the appellate ruling, Ace argued it has no duty to defend Abercrombie under two exclusions in its policy. ####  ##### The first exclusion said the insurer has no liability assumed under any contract or agreement, including any breach or express warranty or guarantee. That exclusion is not applicable, said the panel. “Under Ohio law, contracts are legally enforceable agreements consisting of — among other things — offer, acceptance and consideration … Under this definition, we do not understand the promotional gift cards to be 'contracts' within the meaning” of the exclusion. ####  ##### The second policy exclusion, for “coupons, prize discounts, prizes, awards or any other valuable considerations” also does not apply, said the panel. “Ace neither shows that the plain and ordinary meaning of 'coupon' embraces the promotional gift cards nor justifies looking beyond the policy's plain language,” said the ruling. ####  ##### As a result, the exclusion “does not relieve Ace of its duty to defend,” said the panel, in affirming the lower court's ruling. #### "
"Bumble Bee pays record settlement in death of worker trapped in oven ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### Bumble Bee Foods L.L.C. will pay $6 million for workplace safety violations that caused the death of an employee trapped inside an industrial oven, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced Wednesday. ####  ##### The San Diego, California-based food producer will pay $1.5 million in restitution to the family of Jose Melena, who was killed in October 2012 at the company's Santa Fe Springs, California, plant, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. Mr. Melena was stuck in the back of an industrial oven after his coworkers loaded 12,000 pounds of canned tuna, unaware he was inside the oven. ####  ##### The company will spend $3 million to replace all of its outdated tuna ovens with new, automated ovens and has pledged not to require workers to enter the super-heated, pressurized steam cookers. Bumble Bee must also implement enhanced safety measures such as installing video cameras at their ovens, train managers and workers about safety rules and conduct safety audits of its plant equipment. ####  ##### Another $1.5 million will reimburse investigators for the costs of the criminal inquiry and pay for court costs, fines and penalties, the statement said. ####  ##### The settlement is the largest known payout in a California criminal prosecution of workplace safety violations involving a single victim and requires the company to make a public statement conceding guilt, according to the statement. ####  ##### “Bumble Bee has reached a settlement with the Los Angeles District Attorney's office related to the tragic accident that occurred at our Santa Fe Springs plant in October 2012,” the company said in a statement. “While this resolution will help bring closure with the district attorney's office, we will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities.” ####  ##### Angel Rodriguez of Riverside, California, Bumble Bee's director of plant operations, was charged in the case. He agreed in a plea bargain to perform 320 hours of community service, pay about $11,400 and take classes on lockout tagout and confined-space rules, which are procedures designed to disable machinery or equipment and protect workers from the release of hazardous energy, the district attorney's statement said. ####  ##### Saul Florez, Bumble Bee's former safety manager from Whittier, California, pleaded guilty to a felony count of willfully violating lockout tagout rules and proximately causing Mr. Melena's death. He was sentenced to three years of formal probation, ordered to complete 30 days of community labor, pay $19,000 and also take safety classes. #### "

"Seprafilm maker settles federal lawsuit for $32.5 million ";"Risk Management";"Regulation, Risk Management, General liability, Health Care Costs";" ##### Biotechnology firm Genzyme Corp. will pay $32.5 million to resolve criminal charges with regard to the allegedly unlawful distribution of a surgical device it markets and promotes, the U.S. Department of Justice said. ####  ##### The latest settlement with the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Paris-based pharmaceutical company Sanofi S.A., is in addition to the $22.28 million civil agreement the U.S. government had reached with Genzyme in December 2013 to resolve allegations under the False Claims Act related to Seprafilm, the Justice Department said Thursday in a statement. ####  ##### The conduct at issue occurred between 2005 and 2010, which was prior to Sanofi's 2011 acquisition of Genzyme, the department said. ####  ##### Seprafilm is a clear piece of film that can be applied to internal tissues during pelvic and abdominal surgeries to reduce the formation of adhesions, which are bands of scar tissue that can form between traumatized tissues and organs after surgery, causing them to stick together, the department said. ####  ##### It said Seprafilm was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients undergoing open abdominal or pelvic laparotomy, which is a traditional surgical technique that utilizes a relatively large incision. Over time, however, laparotomy became a less common surgical technique as laparoscopic surgery, which is perceived to have several advantages for the patient, came into favor. ####  ##### The Justice Department charged that Genzyme sales representatives then taught surgeons and other medical staff how to use Seprafilm in laparoscopic procedures, for which it was not approved and which resulted in it becoming adulterated, according to the criminal charges. ####  ##### “Today's action demonstrates that the Department of Justice will evaluate the facts of each case and choose the most appropriate tool of the several available to it to best address criminal misconduct,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department's civil division, said in the statement. ####  ##### A Genzyme spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"EEOC case over restaurant's mandatory arbitration policy can proceed ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### A federal judge has refused to dismiss a claim filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against a restaurant chain over the issue of its requirement that job applicants sign mandatory arbitration agreements. ####  ##### The firm's attorney said the company, Allendale, New Jersey-based Doherty Enterprises Inc., has not violated the law, and that it expects to prevail in the dispute. ####  ##### The EEOC said Tuesday that Doherty, which owns and operates more than 140 franchise restaurants, including Applebee's and Panera Bread, throughout Florida, Georgia, New Jersey and New York, required prospective employees to sign mandatory arbitration agreements in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The agency filed a lawsuit against the chain in the U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September 2014. The court refused to dismiss the case against Doherty, which had argued the EEOC's lawsuit could not proceed because it was not premised upon a discrimination charge, and because the EEOC had not engaged in presuit conciliation, which is required under other sections of the statute, the EEOC said in a statement. ####  ##### The EEOC said the court found that the section of Title VII in question, Section 707, permits the EEOC to seek immediate relief without the same presuit administrative process that is required under another section of Title VII. ####  ##### It also rejected Doherty's argument that the EEOC is limited to claims of discrimination and retaliation under Section 707. ####  ##### Title VII's Section 707 says actions can be filed against firms when there is “reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment” of rights protected by Title VII. ####  ##### “The court's order recognizes EEOC's critical role in eradicating employment discrimination,” Robert E. Weisberg, Miami-based EEOC regional attorney, said in a statement. ####  ##### “Employers cannot immunize themselves from federal oversight by prohibiting employees from filing discrimination charges and communicating with EEOC. As the court held, Title VII gives the agency the authority to take immediate action to challenge the use of these types of overly broad arbitration agreements,” Mr. Weisberg said. ####  ##### “Doherty is confident that further proceedings will reveal the flaws in the EEOC's position that the arbitration agreement does not violate Title VII no matter how the agency frames its arguments,” Doherty's attorney, Dena B. Calo a partner with Saul Ewing L.L.P. in Princeton, New Jersey, said in a statement. “Doherty continues to believe that the case has no merit and will vigorously defend against it.” #### "
"Wilmington Trust fraud lawsuit is now a class action";"Risk Management";"D&O";" ##### (Reuters) — Former Wilmington Trust Co. shareholders may pursue their securities fraud lawsuit over mounting loan losses that led to the company's discounted sale to M&T Bank Corp. as a class action, a Delaware federal judge ruled Thursday. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington agreed with the plaintiffs that there is a common means to calculate damages from Wilmington's alleged concealing of several hundred million dollars worth of troubled construction loans and commercial mortgages in 2009 and 2010. ####  ##### Class actions let plaintiffs sue as a group, and can lead to larger recoveries and lower costs than individual lawsuits. ####  ##### Mounting loan losses led to Wilmington's Nov. 1, 2010, agreement to sell itself to Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank Corp. at a 46% discount to its market value, ending more than a century in business. ####  ##### Several pension funds are leading the Wilmington lawsuit, which covers shareholders from Jan. 18, 2008, to Nov. 1, 2010. ####  ##### Thomas Allingham, a lawyer representing Wilmington and several individual defendants including former Chief Executive Ted Cecala and President Robert Harra, declined to comment.

"Kmart pays $1.4 million to settle Medicare inducement charges";"Risk Management";"D&O";" ##### (Reuters) — Kmart Corp. has paid $1.4 million to settle allegations that it violated the federal False Claims Act by inducing Medicare beneficiaries to fill prescriptions at its pharmacies, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday. ####  ##### The government said the accord resolves allegations that Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings Corp., let beneficiaries use drug manufacturers' coupons to reduce or eliminate prescription copayments. ####  ##### It said this caused people to seek out brand-name drugs rather than cheaper generics, boosting the government's costs. ####  ##### Kmart was also accused of improperly offering discounts on gasoline purchases at participating gas stations based on the number of prescriptions filled. ####  ##### The government said Kmart's improper activity lasted from June 2011 to June 2014, and violated a federal prohibition against offering benefits to Medicare beneficiaries to influence their decisions about which pharmacies to use. ####  ##### Tuesday's settlement resolved claims first brought in a 2013 whistleblower lawsuit by Joshua Leighr, a former Kmart pharmacist from Kansas City, Missouri. He will receive about $248,500 of the payout, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### Kmart has about 780 in-store pharmacies, and settled without any determination of liability, the Justice Department said ####  ##### Howard Riefs, a Sears spokesman, declined to comment. The company is based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. ####  ##### The case is U.S. ex rel. Leighr v. Sears Holdings Corp. et al., U.S. District Court, Western District of Missouri, No. 13-00988. #### "
"'Mark of the Beast' case puts spotlight on religious accommodation ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability";" ##### A U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission case in which a mining worker was awarded $586,860 for allegedly being forced to retire because he refused to use a biometric hand scanner for religious reasons, saying it related to the “Mark of the Beast,” should serve as a warning to employers to take religious accommodation requests seriously, attorneys say. ####  ##### Beverly R. Butcher Jr. had worked as a laborer for Consolidation Coal Co., a unit of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Consol Energy Inc., for more than 35 years when the company began requiring workers to use a newly installed biometric hand scanner to track employee time and attendance, the EEOC said last week in a statement. ####  ##### Mr. Butcher repeatedly informed company officials that submitting to biometric hand scanning violated his religious beliefs as an evangelical Christian. ####  ##### He also wrote a letter to company officials explaining about the relationship between hand-scanning technology and the “Mark of the Beast” and the Antichrist discussed in the New Testament's Book of Revelation, and said he required an exemption from hand scanning based on his religious beliefs, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### Consolidation and Consol refused to consider alternative means of tracking Mr. Butcher's time and attendance, however, and Mr. Butcher was forced to retire, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The EEOC filed suit on Mr. Butcher's behalf, charging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In January, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Clarksburg, West Virginia, awarded Mr. Butcher $150,000 in compensatory damages. ####  ##### Last week, the court awarded Mr. Butcher an additional $436,861 in wages for the Title VII violations found by the jury. The court also ordered a permanent injunction for a three-year period barring the defendants from denying reasonable accommodations for religion in connection with their use of biometric hand scanning, and required them to be trained on religious accommodations under Title VII. ####  ##### “I am very pleased with the final outcome in this case, which is the latest in a series of cases involving Title VII's prohibition against religious discrimination,” said EEOC general counsel David Lopez in a statement. “This victory underscores two important American values: religious freedom and inclusiveness.” ####  ##### St. Clairsville, Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp., which acquired Consolidation Coal in 2013, said in a statement, “The record is clear that Mr. Butcher failed to follow the contractually required dispute resolution procedures. Further, Consolidation Coal Company made a reasonable accommodation for his religious beliefs and never discriminated against Mr. Butcher. We strongly disagree with the decision and will immediately appeal.” ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, Mark Fijman, counsel at law firm Phelps Dunbar L.L.P. in Jackson, Mississippi, said the case “highlights how aggressively the EEOC is pursuing religious discrimination cases, and it should serve as a wakeup call to employers, especially in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in Abercrombie & Fitch.” ####  ##### In its ruling in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the Supreme Court held that employers must consider whether a job applicant needs an accommodation based on religious needs, even if the applicant does not mention the subject. ####  ##### The Abercrombie case “put a heightened standard on employers if they suspect there is a religious accommodation” that is required, Mr. Fijman said. “They have to take a step further than previous courts would call for,” so employers “have to be very proactive in these cases,” he said. ####  ##### Mark S. Kittaka, a partner with law firm Barnes & Thornburg L.L.P. in Fort Wayne, Indiana, said, “Employers need to take seriously any employee's request for reasonable accommodation, regardless of whether they think it seems outrageous or not,” because it has become a “significant point” of emphasis by the EEOC. #### "

"Senators ask automakers for cyber security details";"Risk Management";"Regulation, Auto liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Two U.S. senators have asked the world's biggest automakers for information on steps they have taken to protect cars from being hacked, as attention on vehicle security has surged following the first car recall over a cyber bug. ####  ##### Sens. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., wrote to 18 automakers on Wednesday asking about efforts taken to secure vehicles including 2015 and 2106 models. They asked automakers how they test electronic components and communications systems to ensure attackers cannot gain access to onboard networks. ####  ##### Concerns about auto cyber security have grown since July, when researchers gained remote control of a moving Jeep, prompting Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to recall some 1.4 million vehicles for a software update. ####  ##### The request from the senators follows a review that Sen. Markey began in December 2013. He concluded in a February 2015 report that the spread of technology connecting vehicles to networks had outpaced industry and government efforts to protect vehicles from hackers. ####  ##### The senators said they want to know what automakers have done since the last survey to beef up security. ####  ##### Modern cars typically have dozens of small computers that connect to multiple external networks, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks similar to ones waged on traditional computer systems. Researchers have said attackers could put lives at risk if they can gain remote control of key vehicle systems such as steering and acceleration. ####  ##### ""As vehicles become increasingly connected to the Internet, and to one another through advanced features and services, we continue to see how these technologies present vulnerabilities that can compromise the safety and privacy of drivers and passengers,"" the senators' letter said. ####  ##### They added that the industry has made some progress in recent years. ""We appreciate that many automotive companies have begun to take concrete steps to close these security gaps."" ####  ##### Letter recipients included BMW Group, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Co. and Volkswagen A.G. ####  ##### Security experts have said it will take years for carmakers to plug security holes, because they have been adding computers to vehicles for two decades but only recently started seriously looking for security bugs. ####  ##### ""They've been trying to fix the problems, but it takes a long time,"" Chris Rouland, founder and chief technology officer of cyber security firm Bastille, said in a Reuters.com video on car hacking. #### "
"Insurers not liable to cover Urban Outfitters in ZIP code lawsuits";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers";" ##### Insurers are not obligated to provide defense coverage to Urban Outfitters Inc. for litigation in connection with its allegedly inappropriate collection of ZIP code information, based on their policies’ language, an appeals court ruled. ####  ##### Philadelphia-based Urban Outfitters Inc. and its Anthropologie Inc. subsidiary have been sued in three putative class action lawsuits related to the collection of  ZIP code data, according to Tuesday’s ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in OneBeacon America Insurance Co. v. Urban Outfitters Inc.; Anthropologie Inc. v. Hanover Insurance Group. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit unanimously upheld dismissal of the case in May 2014 by the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia based on the language of the policies issued by OneBeacon America, a unit of Hamilton, Bermuda-based OneBeacon Insurance Group Ltd., and by Worcester, Massachusetts-based Hanover Insurance Group Inc. ####  ##### For instance, in the first underlying case, filed in 2013 in the District of Columbia, plaintiffs alleged that Urban Outfitters’ request for  ZIP code information when customers made a credit card purchase violated the District of Columbia statute. ####  ##### The appeals court agreed with the lower court that the insurers’ policy provided coverage for “personal and advertising injury” arising out of publication. Urban Outfitters’ actions, “do not constitute ‘publication’ within the policies’ definition of ‘personal and advertising injury,’” said the ruling. ####  ##### The appeals court also upheld dismissal of the two other actions, based on the insurers’ policy language, one of which was filed in state court in San Diego, with the other now in U.S. District Court in Boston. #### "

But on March 30, it paid $211 million to settle a tax issue regarding BSI activities in the United States. ####  ##### In 2012, the insurer launched a turnaround plan to help firm up its balance sheet and boost cash generation by cutting costs and selling assets. ####  ##### ""The disposal of BSI completes Generali's strategy to focus on its core insurance business and improve its capital position,"" the group said on Tuesday. ####  ##### The sale of BSI lifted the group's economic solvency ratio — a closely watched measure of financial strength, calculated using internal models based on tougher industry rules, or Solvency II, that will come into force next year — by 8 percentage points to 200% as of June 30. ####  ##### The deal also boosted the Solvency I ratio by 8 percentage points to 164%, it said. ####  ##### At 1456 GMT, Generali shares were up 1.4 percent, in line with the European insurance index. #### "

"Ex-hacker: Act on assumption nothing is safe";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Emerging Risks, 2015 Cyber Risk Summit";" ##### SAN FRANCISCO — During the Industrial Age, there was a simplicity to the repetition of small tasks, but in today's Information Age, complexity drives progress, an ex-hacker told attendees at Business Insurance's 2015 Cyber Risk Summit in San Francisco. ####  ##### “Complexity grew over the years of the Information Age, and now, specialization is the key to progress,” Jeff Moss, a former hacker also known as The Dark Tangent, said Monday. “And 10 years from now, we will be even more specialized, but this will lead to complexity with systems that fail in unpredictable ways.” ####  ##### Mr. Moss, also is a member of several key organizations involving cyber risk mitigation, including the Homeland Security Advisory Council. ####  ##### How any system will fail is impossible to predict, he said. “Just assume it will fail, for your own well-being, so you can sleep,” he said. ####  ##### Hackers, according to Mr. Moss, are categorized into four groups: nation states who want secrets, organized criminals who want money, protestors who want attention and researchers who want knowledge. ####  ##### A common type of cyber attack used by hackers is a distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack, where a DoS attack compromises multiple systems to target a single system and cause a denial of service, by locking the data. These attacks are getting worse year by year, Mr. Moss said, and there is no known way to keep data safe. ####  ##### Even physical keys used to lock data can be photographed by thieves and hackers and then replicated by using a 3-D printer. The only safe physical key available at this time is EVVA MCS, which uses magnets on both sides of the keys so hackers can't tell the orientation of the magnets. Mr. Moss said he uses these types of keys for his home. ####  ##### As technology manufacturers continue to build devices that store and have the ability to update their data, nobody has given thought to the problem of being able to manage and upgrade their systems once they are made vulnerable, he said. ####  ##### “Encrypted police radios, mobile phones, GPS, Web browsers, alarms and access control systems, satellite phones and pagers — none of these are safe,” he told the conference. ####  ##### “Eventually, a software-enabled toaster will burn down a house, and this is where software liability will begin, but right now the only software liability is the price of the software,” Mr. Moss said. ####  ##### In the meantime, people need to be responsible for their own security, he recommended. ####  ##### “You need to have a holistic approach; have a knowledgeable team that will understand the technology, a life cycle management of prevent-detect-respond, senior leadership to buy in and have ownership of protecting the company and, finally, do what you can when you can,” he said. #### "
"Appeals court draws clearer line between interns, gofers ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Employers still using unpaid interns for nontraining-related tasks may have to reconsider doing so in light of the most recent appeals court ruling on the issue. ####  ##### Observers also say the ruling on unpaid interns by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta in Bill Schumann et al. v. Collier Anesthesia P.A., is a victory for employers because it supports an earlier appeals court ruling that rejects the U.S. Department of Labor's standard for determining when an intern can be unpaid. ####  ##### They say the ruling is also likely to be influential with other courts. ####  ##### Plaintiffs in Schumann were 25 former registered nurse anesthetist students who attended a master's degree program at Wolford College L.LC. In Naples, Florida, with the goal of becoming certified registered nurse anesthetists. During their study, the students participated in a clinical curriculum required to obtain their master's degrees under Florida law, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Students were seeking in the litigation to recover unpaid wages and overtime they claimed they were due under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The U.S. District Court in Fort Myers, Florida, granted the defendants summary judgment dismissing the case on the basis the students were not employees under the act. ####  ##### According to the 11th Circuit's Sept. 11 ruling, in guidance based on a 1947 U.S. Supreme Court case involving railroad brakemen, Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., the Labor Department has said trainees and students are not employees within the meaning of the FLSA only if all of six criteria are met. These are: ####  ##### • The training involves actual operation of the employer's facilities ####  ##### • It is for the benefit of the trainees ####  ##### • The trainees do not displace regular employees ####  ##### • The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the trainees' activities ####  ##### • The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the end of the training period ####  ##### • The trainees understand they are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training ####  ##### However, says the unanimous ruling of the 11th Circuit's three-judge panel, “We do not defer to this test because, with all due respect to the DOL and the important work it does, we do not find it persuasive.” ####  ##### Since that 1947 ruling, says the 11th Circuit, courts have “for the most part, concentrated on evaluating the 'primary beneficiary' ” of the training or school program to determine whether the participants are employees. ####  ##### As the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York observed on July 2 in its  ruling in Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures Inc., the facts of the 1947 case “do not necessarily 'reflect the role of internships in today's economy…' ” said the 11th Circuit. ####  ##### “Longer-term, intensive modern internships that are required to obtain academic degrees and professional certification and licensure in a field are just too different from the short training classes offered by the railroading Portland Terminal for the purpose of creating its own labor pool,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The ruling cites the “non-exhaustive set of considerations” for evaluating the “primary beneficiary” in cases involving modern internships described by the 2nd Circuit in its ruling. These are the extent to which: ####  ##### • Intern and employer understand there is no expectation of compensation ####  ##### • The training is similar to what would be provided in an educational environment ####  ##### • The internship accommodates the intern's academic commitments ####  ##### • The internship is limited to the period in which it provides beneficial learning ####  ##### • The intern's work complements, rather than displaces, paid employees ####  ##### • Intern and employer understand the internships are being conducted without entitlement of a paid job at the internship's end ####  ##### The case was remanded to the District Court to consider these factors. ####  ##### The takeaway ####  ##### “The test that the Department of Labor continues to use requires that an internship program meet all the factors in order to be considered a bona fide (internship) relationship,” said William R. Pokorny, a partner with law firm Franczek Radelet P.C. in Chicago. ####  ##### “The test that the 11th Circuit adopted in this new decision makes it clear that the factors are only a guide for the court and that the presence or absence of only one those factors is not necessarily dispositive,” Mr. Pokorny said. “And the court's ruling makes it clear that although internship programs may not meet all of the factors in the Department of Labor test, in the court's view, many of those internship programs are still properly considered internships rather than employment relationships.” ####  ##### The ruling reaffirms that employers are mistaken if they are “acting under the misconception that they can use the services of unpaid interns for routine job-related tasks and not pay them,” said Jonathan T. Hyman, a partner with law firm Meyers, Roman, Friedberg & Lewis in Cleveland. ####  ##### The days of using unpaid interns “for just about anything other than bona fide educational training” are about ended, he said ####  ##### Mr. Hyman said the ruling is potentially influential because it is the first case since the Department of Labor began looking at this issue “where you actually had coursework,” unlike the Fox case, where interns were making coffee. “This is more of what you would think of as a traditional internship,” he said. ####  ##### He said he hopes the District Court will decide that because the internship was part of a course, “the individuals were the primary beneficiaries, and therefore were not employees under the FLSA.” ####  ##### With this ruling, along with the 2nd Circuit ruling, “you have another nail in the coffin of the Department of Labor trying to overreach and assert that persons are employees when they are indeed not employees. In these cases, they are more appropriately students,” said Evan J. Spelfogel, a partner with Epstein Becker & Green P.C. in New York. ####  ##### Mr. Spelfogel pointed to Labor Department guidance issued in July on classifying workers as employee versus independent contractors, which emphasizes the alleged misclassification of many workers as independent contractors. #### "
"Plumbing contractor to pay for forcing out employees at age 62";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Construction";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reached a $140,000 settlement with a heating and plumbing contractor who allegedly fired two long-time employees when they reached age 62, and had also retaliated against one of the workers for resisting its plans. ####  ##### The attorney for the company, Superior, Wisconsin-based Stack Brothers Mechanical Contractors Inc., said Monday in a statement that the owner had planned to terminate both workers several years ago, but only kept them on until age 62 so they would be eligible for Social Security. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement issued Friday that Superior, Wisconsin-based Stack Brothers Mechanical Contractors Inc., a major heating and plumbing contractor in northern Wisconsin and northern Minnesota, had fired Randy Virta, a 16-year employee, and Karen Kolodzeske, a 25-year employee, although the company’s owner had been warned by the employees that this was illegal. ####  ##### The EEOC said also that after firing Mr. Virta, the owner retaliated against Ms. Kolodzeske for her complaints about being fired at age 62 by denying her a raise, suspending her without pay for two days and creating a hostile work environment while waiting for her to turn 62 before firing her as well. ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement agreement, Stack Brothers will pay $95,000 to Mr. Virta and $35,000 to Ms. Kolodzeske, plus $10,000 of their attorney’s fees, and train its managers and employees regarding employer obligations under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1987. ####  ##### “Employers often speak about how valuable loyalty in the workplace is,” said EEOC Chicago regional attorney John C. Hendrickson, in a statement. “But it’s a two-way street. Long-time, dedicated employees, like those in this case, are entitled to expect that their employers will not discharge them because of their age and in defiance of federal law. When Stack Bros. fired Mr. Virta and Ms. Kolodzeske because of their age, it ruptured the band of loyalty. This settlement is a way to make things right.” ####  ##### Stack Brothers’ attorney, James B. Sherman, president and CEO of Wessels Sherman Joerg Liszka Laverty Seneczko P.C. in Minneapolis, said in a statement: “As the EEOC’s trial attorney noted in a recent interview, in his deposition the owner of Stack Bros. testified that he determined he no longer needed the two employees in question several years prior to their departures. ####  ##### “Rather than letting them go at that time the owner notified both employees years in advance that they would be retained until reaching the age of 62 based on the assumption that they would become eligible to receive (S)ocial (S)ecurity. Consequently, the allegation that these individuals were terminated simply for turning 62 has always been vehemently denied. ####  ##### “Stack Bros.’ decision to resolve this lawsuit was made to avoid further disruptions to its business and the ongoing costs of litigation against a large federal agency with vast resources. In doing so Stack Bros. has not admitted to any wrongdoing.” ####  ##### In July, Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Los Angeles L.L.C., which was charged with failing to hire management trainees who were over 40, agreed to pay $425,000 to settle an age discrimination suit filed by the EEOC. #### "

"Employers continue to stumble on FMLA issues ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Disability";" ##### A Family Medical Leave Act case in which an allegedly abusive employee was terminated three days after he submitted FMLA paperwork illustrates the need for FMLA training, says an expert. ####  ##### James Hefti, a tool and die designer at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin-based Brunk Industries Inc. was repeatedly the subject of complaints by colleagues who said he said he made inappropriate and offensive comments, according to last month's ruling by the U.S. District Court in Milwaukee in James Hefti v. Brunk Industries Inc. ####  ##### According to one employee's complaint, for instance, Mr. Hefti “would tell co-workers what they were doing wrong using an unprofessional and degrading tone of voice, and instigate arguments with others as well.” ####  ##### In March 2013, Mr. Hefti requested FMLA leave became his son was suffering from various mental health issues and he needed to arrive late or leave early to help drop him off or pick him up from school, according to the ruling. His supervisor, Rick Eisel, told him “that Brunk paid for Hefti's insurance and thus expected him to be at work.” When Mr. Hefti told Mr. Eisel he had turned in his FMLA paperwork, Mr. Eisel “appeared frustrated and aggravated,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Hefti was terminated three days later, with the stated reason being that his communications with co-workers “were unprofessional and generally inappropriate. “ ####  ##### Mr. Hefti filed suit in federal court, charging the company had interfered with his FMLA rights and fired him in retaliation for exercising them. The court refused Brunk's motion to dismiss the case. ####  ##### “If Hefti was really on the road to being fired, it seems odd that Eisel would be upset about Hefti taking time away from work,” said Judge Rudolph T. Randa in his ruling. ####  ##### “On the contrary, it seems that Eisel would welcome the respite from a belligerent employee. Thus, the inference can be drawn that the stated reason for Hefti's termination was a pretext for discrimination.” ####  ##### Jeffrey Nowak, a partner with Franczek Radelet P.C. in Chicago, said, “What's maddening about the case is that, by all accounts, this seemed like one awful employee to interact with, and yet the employer trips itself up with one insensitive comment by a manager. ####  ##### “This case screams for FMLA training for managers,” said Mr. Nowak. “In a workforce, so often these kinds of situations arise due to managers not understanding how to handle these situations due to a lack of training. They get frustrated, and that often manifests itself in what managers then say to employees, and as a result, it results in a great deal of risk for the company.” #### "

"Takata recall said to involve more than 11 carmakers";"Risk Management";"Auto liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Takata Corp.'s unprecedented recall of potentially deadly air bag inflators affects more than the 11 auto manufacturers that have already been identified, the top U.S. auto safety regulator said on Monday. ####  ##### Mark Rosekind, who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told reporters that his agency will disclose new automakers at a one-hour public hearing on the Takata recall set for Thursday. ####  ##### ""It goes beyond the 11,"" said Mr. Rosekind, who met with automakers and suppliers affected by the Takata recall over the summer. On Thursday, NHTSA is expected to make a case that it should coordinate the Takata recall to ensure that an estimated 19 million defective Takata air bag inflators in U.S. vehicles are replaced by safer alternatives. ####  ##### Mr. Rosekind also said he believes automakers could follow the lead of General Motors Co. by moving quickly on Takata-related recalls as additional attention is focused on the danger. ####  ##### ""It would not surprise me if other people decide to deal earlier and faster with these issues,"" Mr. Rosekind said. ####  ##### The air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal shrapnel into passenger compartments, have been linked to at least eight deaths and more than 100 injuries worldwide. ####  ##### Experts say the ammonium nitrate used as a chemical accelerator in the inflators could become unstable after being exposed to high humidity over a period of time. Some have suggested that auto design, including how well sealed passenger compartments are against humidity, could also be a factor. ####  ##### ""Think about age, high humidity, all the different factors. Now you add design of the vehicle,"" Mr. Rosekind said. ####  ##### Newer Takata inflators have not been shown to be a problem, he added. ####  ##### ""So far the testing is showing that the newer ones seem to be solid,"" Mr. Rosekind said. #### "
"Pharma firm Hospira to pay $400,000 for bias against female job-seekers";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Claims Disputes, General liability";" ##### Pharmaceutical firm Hospira Inc. will pay $400,000 in back wages with interest to 145 female job applicants to settle hiring discrimination charges by the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the DOL said Tuesday. ####  ##### New York-based Pfizer Corp. completed its acquisition of Hospira in September. Hospira has more than $35 million in government contracts for developing and manufacturing injection medications for the U.S. government, according to the DOL. ####  ##### In addition to paying the $400,000, Hospira committed to hiring 11 female job applicants, according to the DOL. ####  ##### The OFCCP found in its investigation that female applicants for pharmacy attendant positions were hired at much lower rates than similarly qualified male applicants at Hospira's McPherson, Kansas, facility, and that Hospira violated record-keeping requirements by failing to preserve employment applications and interview forms, the DOL said. ####  ##### “Discrimination is preventable when employers have nondiscriminatory selection procedures in place and see to it that they are followed,” said OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu, in the statement. “Hospira has worked proactively with our agency to resolve the alleged discrimination and to ensure that all required employment records will be maintained going forward.” ####  ##### Hospira said in a statement it “believes hiring practices at the plant have been fair.To close this matter from 2012 out, the company has entered into a conciliation agreement with the OFCCP. Hospira has a strong track record of compliance with OFCCP requirements and is confident our hiring practices support the company's priority of employing diverse and skilled talent.” ####  ##### Last week, a Minnesota fastener company agreed to pay $1.3 million to settle OFCCP charges that it discriminated against 171 black and female job applicants who sought general warehouse positions at two of its distribution facilities in Indianapolis and Atlanta. #### "
"Fired engineering worker gets race, wage bias case reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Claims Disputes, General liability";" ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a race discrimination charge filed by a former engineering firm employee who was allegedly hired at a lower salary than a similarly-qualified white worker, then became the first employee involuntarily terminated in a reduction in force after he complained. ####  ##### Melvin Smith was hired as an instructor/trainer as part of a project where URS Corp., which is now a unit of Los Angeles-based Aecom Technology Corp., was hired by the U.S. Army to destroy munitions at a facility in Arkansas, according to Wednesday’s ruling by the 8th U.S. circuit Court of appeals in St. Louis in Melvin Smith v. URS Corp. ####  ##### Although Mr. Smith sought a position of training specialist at a salary of $46,000, he was hired with a salary of $57,668 per year. Five months later, URS hired a white applicant, Jesse Griffin, who had also applied for a position of training specialist, at a salary of $65,000 a year and gave him the title of senior training specialist. ####  ##### Two months later it hired another black male applicant, Stanley Ellis, as a training specialist at salary of $57,668. Four other trainers, three of whom were white and one of whom was Hispanic, were subsequently hired as senior training specialists at a higher wage than Mr. Smith or Mr. Ellis, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Smith learned of the salary disparity and complained to training manager Ted Howard. Mr. Howard later conducted a subjective ranking of the trainers, and placed Mr. Smith and Mr. Ellis first in line to be terminated in a reduction in force although, unlike the two men, Mr. Griffith and another trainer who were ranked higher had disciplinary reports on their personnel files. Mr. Smith was subsequently the first trainer to be involuntarily terminated in a reduction in force. ####  ##### Mr. Smith filed suit, charging race discrimination and retaliation. The U.S. District Court in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, granted URS summary judgment dismissing the case, stating Mr. Smith had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. ####  ##### The appeals court reinstated the case in a 2-1 ruling. Between Mr. Smith’s and Mr. Ellis’ hiring, “a white man without meaningfully different qualifications applied for a position in the same department to perform the same work and received a higher-ranking and higher-paying position than the black men (a position for which he had applied),” said the majority opinion, in reversing dismissal of the racial discrimination charge. The court also said the lower court, which did not discuss the retaliation claim, should address that issue. ####  ##### The dissenting opinion said because Mr. Smith was hired at a salary that was $10,000 per year more than he requested, he had not suffered an adverse employment action in the hiring process. ####  ##### In June, an appeals court reinstated a retaliation lawsuit filed by a District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority worker who said he was terminated in retaliation for complaining about racial discrimination. #### "

"Aon Hewitt sees $15 billion shift from U.K. defined pensions this year ";"Risk Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, Risk Management, Aon Hewitt, United Kingdom";" ##### LONDON (Reuters) — Deals involving transferring the risk of British company defined benefit pension schemes to insurers are likely to total £10 billion ($15.35 billion) this year, down from last year's record £13 billion pounds, consultants Aon Hewitt said Monday. ####  ##### These ""bulk annuity"" deals are a good source of income for U.K. life insurers, particularly after government pension reform at least halved the sale of individual annuities. ####  ##### For companies, the deals remove the headache of running the pension schemes. Years of low interest rates mean many schemes are in deficit and these sometimes need to be filled by the company before the life insurer takes on the risk. ####  ##### Aon Hewitt said in a report there had been £3.6 billion pounds in bulk annuity deals in the second quarter, compared with only £800 million in the first quarter. ####  ##### ""With insurers busy on a substantial number of transactions which could conclude before Christmas, £10 billion is not an unrealistic expectation for year."" ####  ##### But European Solvency II capital rules to be introduced in January are likely to mean insurers have to set aside more money to cover the cost of bulk annuity transactions, and these have been a concern. ####  ##### ""2015 has been a period of flux,"" Aon Hewitt said, pointing out that on Solvency II, ""some details have remained obstinately gray."" ####  ##### Life insurers are moving to reinsure this business outside Europe to soften the impact of the new rules. ####  ##### Prudential P.L.C. and Legal & General Group P.L.C. were the most active in the bulk annuity market in the year to date, the report said. #### "
"Acceptance grows as more capital flows into reinsurance ";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Aon Benfield, Guy Carpenter & Co., Marsh & McLennan, Gallery";" ##### Capital markets keep gaining traction in the reinsurance space, and players see continued growth despite lingering concerns, according to sources speaking on the sidelines at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America annual conference Oct. 25-28 in Hollywood, Florida. ####  ##### More participants are utilizing capital markets coverage. ####  ##### “In the last 24 months, you've seen reinsurers that I think have recognized that we've reached the end of the beginning, meaning they have accepted the challenge and started incorporating it into their underwriting capital structures,” said Bryon Ehrhart, CEO of Aon Benfield Americas in Chicago. ####  ##### “So, leading reinsurers in the last 24 months have more alternative capital that has been incorporated into their value proposition for our clients,” said Mr. Ehrhart. ####  ##### Capital markets coverage is gradually losing its “alternative capital” status as it becomes a more familiar option. ####  ##### “I think it's just capital. It's just more capital flowing in. You can call it whatever you want.” said Rod Fox, managing partner for TigerRisk Partners in Stamford, Connecticut. “And what we see and hear is that there's still a significant amount of it that wants to come in.” ####  ##### Mr. Fox is bullish on the sector. ####  ##### “We think it's more than doubling over the next five years,” said Mr. Fox. “Our number was $180 billion to $200 billion, and I still think that's still within the ballpark.” ####  ##### Aon Securities Inc. put the total as of June 30 at $68.4 billion. ####  ##### Catastrophe bonds expand ####  ##### Private catastrophe bonds are helping fuel growth. ####  ##### Expansion of the private catastrophe bond market has been rapid, having grown to $846.9 million of capital raised in 19 deals through Oct. 13 of this year from $561.5 million in 17 deals in all of 2014 and $181.2 million in six deals in 2013, said Cory Anger, global head of ILS structuring at GC Securities, a division of MMC Securities Corp., in New York. ####  ##### Private catastrophe bonds offer clients the potential for lower limits and costs. ####  ##### “It's done in a way where you can do smaller limits, something under $75 million, and it's done in a less rigorous way with less paperwork and modeling so that the expenses don't overwhelm the all-in pricing,” said Ms. Anger. ####  ##### One source, however, reiterated a lasting concern hanging over the capital markets. ####  ##### “Obviously it hasn't been tested yet with a big event,” said Steve Levy, president, reinsurance, for Munich Reinsurance America Inc. in Princeton, New Jersey. ####  ##### But he remains confident overall. ####  ##### “Our sense is that the investors who are really committed to the market will likely remain after a major event, but there will be some investors who will decide to withdraw from the marketplace once it is really tested with a major event,” said Mr. Levy. #### "

"Gays not protected by Missouri's human rights law, court rules ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability";" ##### The Missouri Human Rights Act's protection against sex discrimination does not extend to sexual orientation, says a divided state appeals court in dismissing a lawsuit filed by a gay man. ####  ##### James Pittman worked as a controller for Overland Park, Kansas-based Cook Paper Recycling Corp., which did business in Missouri, from April 2004 until his termination in December 2011, during which time he was allegedly subjected to comments of a sexual nature by the company president, according to Tuesday's ruling by the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western district in Kansas City in James Pittman v. Cook Paper Recycling Corp. ####  ##### Mr. Pittman filed suit against the company, charging sex discrimination on the basis of his sexual orientation. A circuit court in Kansas City, Missouri, dismissed the case, and the appeals court upheld the ruling. ####  ##### “The plain language of the Missouri Human Rights Act is clear and unambiguous,” said the appeals court's 2-1 majority opinion. ####  ##### “Employers cannot discriminate against employees on the basis of their 'sex.' The clear meaning prohibiting discrimination based upon 'sex' under the Missouri Human Rights Act intended by the Missouri legislature … has nothing to do with sexual orientation.” ####  ##### “Unlike many other states, the Missouri legislature has not enacted legislation prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals by adding sexual orientation as protected class,” said the ruling. “It could have done so” had it so desired, said the ruling. ####  ##### The dissenting judge's opinion states: “Given the fact that the Missouri Human Rights Act is a remedial statute to be construed liberally to include those cases within the spirit of the law with all reasonable doubts to be construed in favor of applicability to the case, I would find that Pittman stated a claim” under the act “and leave it to the jury to decide whether Pittman can provide the elements necessary to prevail on his claim of sexual harassment.” ####  ##### According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit sexual orientation discrimination. Current federal law does not explicitly extend civil rights protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. ####  ##### In July, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held in a < a href=""/article/20150717/NEWS06/150719848"">divided ruling applicable only to federal workers that workplace sexual orientation discrimination is illegal under federal law. #### "
"RIMS reports chart growth of enterprise risk management ";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management, Risk Management";" ##### CHICAGO — The implementation of enterprise risk management is making significant strides, according to two executive reports released Monday at the Risk & Insurance Management Society's enterprise risk management conference in Chicago. ####  ##### The reports, written by Carol Fox, the RIMS director of strategic & enterprise risk  practice, and Steve Minsky, CEO and founder of LogicManager, are tools risk professionals can use when assessing their current programs and making necessary changes to their future risk management strategies. ####  ##### “Adopting ERM is a commitment,” RIMS President Rick Roberts said in a news release. “The initial implementation process is only the beginning. Risk professionals must continue to work to advance their risk programs, to maintain support from leadership and keep operations managers engaged.” ####  ##### The RIMS “State of ERM Report 2015” compares data from the organization's risk maturity model that was collected over the past seven years. The last such report was issued in 2008. The findings in the report suggest that competency drivers, or the processes that are put in place at all levels of an organization when applying enterprise risk management techniques, have improved considerably since the previous report. ####  ##### Another trend found within the collected data was that more than 2,000 organizations were using the RIMS risk maturity model to assess their maturity levels and make action plan improvements, a “250% increase over the 564 organizations studied in 2008,” the report said. ####  ##### The second RIMS report, “About the RIMS Risk Maturity Model” provides background about the model used and the drivers that define a well-managed ERM program, a RIMS news release said Monday. ####  ##### The “State of ERM Report 2015” and “About RIMS Risk Maturity Model” are available in RIMS' risk knowledge library. #### "
"Putting big data to work in search of next asbestos";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, General liability";" ##### Casualty catastrophe modeling is increasingly a focus of insurers and reinsurers as markets seek to identify and measure the next mass tort exposure. ####  ##### Lloyd's of London and Los Angeles-based modeler Praedicat Inc. earlier this month released a report outlining the challenges of casualty cat analysis. Praedicat has developed models that mine data from a variety of public sources to identify and quantify emerging mass tort risks and then apply the information to insurer portfolios. ####  ##### Reinsurance units of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. and Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. have also developed liability cat models using large databases of historic losses. ####  ##### While the insurance industry's typical response to liability disasters like asbestos has been to limit or bar coverage, successful modeling may allow insurers to underwrite more selectively and manage risk accumulation, reducing coverage bans and limitations, according to Lloyd's. ####  ##### Reinsurers, including the insurance-linked securities market, may also develop products to spread accumulation risk, Lloyd's noted in its report. ####  ##### While property cat modeling has been able to rely on meteorology, seismology, historical loss patterns and geo-specific risk data, modeling emerging casualty risks “is a relatively new field without an established methodology,” Lloyd's said in its Oct. 15 report, “Emerging Liability Risks: Harnessing Big Data Analytics.” ####  ##### Praedicat — which, backed by Newark, California-based catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc., released its first liability cat model in February — starts by mining millions of peer-reviewed science journal articles and other data sources to identify substances and products that may pose threats of bodily injury or environmental damage. The model monitors scientific research on possible causal links between a product and injuries “before it matures to the point that it can support litigation,” according to the Lloyd's report. ####  ##### The model is also designed to “contextualize” a given risk, comparing its potential impact to other emerging and historical risks; and to use detailed information about a policyholder company's products and operations to place the company on a “map” of those exposed to liability disasters, the report explains. ####  ##### Praedicat then applies the model's data to an insurer's portfolio to quantify its exposure to mass litigation. The model can also be used to analyze an industry's mass tort exposure and to measure an insurer's clash exposure across industries in a given line of coverage, according to Praedicat. ####  ##### Others have developed their own models for casualty catastrophes. Marsh & McLennan's Guy Carpenter & Co. L.L.C. unveiled its ForCas model in March, focusing first on measuring insurers' exposure to “sudden disasters,” such as oil rig explosions, that can generate multibillion-dollar cleanup costs, environmental liabilities and fines. In June, it expanded the model to cover catastrophe risks of financial institutions across directors and officers liability, errors and omissions, excess casualty and fidelity lines; and cyber exposures including privacy liability, network security liability, business interruption and data asset losses. ####  ##### Willis Re, meanwhile, has developed eNTAIL, which uses an analysis of more than 30 years of casualty cat events to project a probability distribution of potential future client insurer losses, according to the broker. Separately, Willis Re earlier this year announced a $400 million reinsurance facility, dubbed PRIMO, to provide ceding insurers with coverage for liability cat accumulation exposures. The facility, backed by 20 reinsurers, covers multiple accident years across all casualty and professional liability lines. ####  ##### “While the world has changed since asbestos litigation emerged, the interplay between science, technology-driven innovation and risk which can drive the accumulation of exposure has not,” Lloyd's observed in its report. Lloyd's noted possible toxicity of nanomaterials and potential environmental impacts of oil and gas hydrofracking among the emerging risks. ####  ##### Modeling that makes these exposures more predictable could help insurers and policyholders, sources say. ####  ##### “The results from casualty catastrophe modeling can lead to better underwriting — for example, risk selection, pricing for future events, portfolio optimization (and) exposure through policy terms,” according to a 2013 analysis by Towers Watson & Co. ####  ##### Modeling can also help map realistic disaster scenarios, validate capital model assumptions and test risk mitigation strategies, Towers Watson said. #### "
"Bill would allow nonprofits to cover property in risk retention groups";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Political Risk, Insurance-linked Securities, Property";" ##### Nearly three decades after federal lawmakers passed legislation expanding coverages risk retention groups can provide to member-owners, a new effort is being launched to further expand RRGs. ####  ##### Legislation introduced Wednesday by Reps. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., and Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., would allow certain risk retention groups to cover policyholders’ property risks. ####  ##### Specifically, the measure, H.R. 3794, would allow RRGs to write property coverages for policyholders that are nonprofit organizations with tax-exempt status or educational institutions and educational-related institutions that are nonprofit organizations or governmental entities. ####  ##### The expansion of coverage, though, only would be available to RRGs that have been operating for at least 10 years, while the RRG would have to maintain capital and surplus of at least $10 million. ####  ##### The legislation also only would allow adding property coverage as long as the total insured value of risks of any individual policyholder insured by the RRG does not exceed $50 million. ####  ##### Backers of the legislation say the expansion is needed because small to medium sized nonprofit organizations often cannot obtain property coverage on a standalone basis. ####  ##### “We are trying to solve a real need in the marketplace,” said Pamela Davis, president and CEO of the Vermont-domiciled Alliance of Nonprofits for Insurance Risk Retention Group in Santa Cruz, California. ####  ##### Virtually all of the RRG’s 6,200 member-owners would benefit if Congress passed the expansion legislation, Ms. Davis said. ####  ##### Some organizations, though, oppose the measure. “Allowing RRGs to write nearly any form of commercial insurance coverage while retaining a weaker and preferential system of regulatory oversight will create an uneven playing field, distort the competitive balance within the insurance market, and, most importantly, place consumers at increased risk,” Charles Symington, senior vice president of external and federal government affairs at the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia said in a statement. ####  ##### Other insurance-related organizations, though, support the bill. The expansion will help an “underserved market,” said Joel Wood, senior vice president of the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers in Washington. ####  ##### The National Risk Retention Association does not yet have a position on the measure, said Jon Harkavy, NRRA’s secretary. ####  ##### But speaking personally, Mr. Harkavy, who also is vice president and general counsel of RRG manager Risk Services L.L.C. in Washington, said if Congress does expand the law, that expansion should not be limited to nonprofit organizations. ####  ##### “We don’t want a two-tier system,” he said. ####  ##### Congress passed the original risk retention group legislation in 1981. The law allowed RRGs, which are special group captives to provide coverage to member-owners after meeting the licensing requirements of one state. The 1981 law, though, limited RRG coverage to product liability and completed operations risks. ####  ##### Then, in 1986, Congress expanded the law to allow RRGs to write all casualty coverages, except workers compensation. ####  ##### Currently, there are about 235 RRGs. #### "
"Engage all levels of employees to achieve effective cyber security";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, Technology";" ##### As emerging technologies introduce new security risks to businesses, risk managers should have a solid plan in place to both prevent and respond to a potential cyber attack, according to a recent panel of insurance industry experts. ####  ##### But the plan should strike a balance between protecting the firm from cyber breaches while still enabling the business to perform its operations with the technology necessary to do so, experts said Tuesday during the Insurance Executive Forum held by Illinois State University's Katie School of Insurance and Financial Services in Chicago. ####  ##### Data breaches are becoming more common, making response plans all the more essential to protect the property and reputation of an organization. According to a September 2014 study by the Traverse City, Michigan-based Ponemon Institute L.L.C., 43% of companies said they suffered a cyber attack in 2014, compared with 33% in 2013. ####  ##### And employers are acting: 73% of organizations have developed a data breach response plan in 2014, up from 61% the year before, the Ponemon Institute found. ####  ##### An effective data breach response plan includes three parts, said Greg Bee, the director of corporate information security governance and chief information security officer with Bloomington, Illinois-based insurer Country Financial. ####  ##### The first step is to determine how to prevent a breach from occurring by assessing the risks of the organization and where the gaps in security are, Mr. Bee said. Firms should also prepare to “dissect the attack” once it occurs, he said. ####  ##### “We have to understand why we're being attacked, how we're being attacked and what the motive of the attackers (is),” Mr. Bee said. ####  ##### Third, if a breach does occur, organizations should know ahead of time how to portray themselves in the public. Holding mock cyber incidents can help prepare the organization in all scenarios, he said. ####  ##### Companies that are successful at battling cyber breaches include all leadership and workers in the plan to prevent attacks, said W. James Regan, senior vice president of FINPRO at Marsh L.L.C. ####  ##### But it's important to note that employees are often one of an organization's greatest “vulnerabilities,” said Paul Larson, senior vice president and specialty risk manager with Chubb Specialty Insurance, a unit of Chubb Corp. ####  ##### As such, training workers in cyber security is necessary. For instance, Country Financial began testing its employees' cyber security practices four years ago by sending a fake phishing email crafted by a third-party organization to 400 workers during the benefits enrollment period, Mr. Bee said. The email was made to look as if it was sent from the benefits team, and 320 employees clicked the malicious link. Forty-percent actually handed over credentials, he said. ####  ##### But after performing the test each year since, last year only 2% of Country Financial's employees clicked the malicious link, and only one person gave up credentials, Mr. Bee said. ####  ##### Securing cyber insurance ####  ##### The insurance industry has “done a good job expanding cyber” insurance coverage to include potential sources of costs, such as business interruption and extortion, Mr. Regan said. ####  ##### According to the Ponemon Institute study, in 2014 26% of organizations adopted a cyber insurance policy, compared with 10% in 2013. ####  ##### Insurance options for middle market employers are widely available, and organizations can outsource to a third-party vendor to perform an annual review of the cyber security practices, experts said. ####  ##### According to Mr. Larson, a good agent or broker “is critical” because they work to find gaps in the cyber security of an organization. But in the end, he said, data breach preparedness begins with a good cyber security policy in the workplace. #### "

Carroll and Larry Moore who were partners for restaurant Tomaydo-Tomahhdo Express L.L.C. and a delivery catering business that ultimately led to a copyright disagreement. ####  ##### Mr. Moore conceived hit recipes for the restaurant's menu, according to Tuesday's ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals in Tomaydo-Tomahhdo L.L.C. et al. v. George Vozary, et al. ####  ##### Ms. Carroll and Mr. Moore parted ways in 2007, with Mr. Moore signing a share purchase agreement agreeing to return all recipes to Ms. Carroll. Mr. Moore opened a catering business in 2011. ####  ##### In 2012, Ms. Carroll assembled a recipe book based on Mr. Moore's recipes and applied for copyright protection in 2014. She then sued Mr. Moore for copyright infringement, among other charges, claiming he was using the recipes in his catering business. ####  ##### But to prove copyright infringement creativity must be involved, and there is nothing creative about a mere collection of recipes, said a three-judge appeals court panel in Cincinnati in affirming a lower court ruling dismissing the case. ####  ##### It may have been different had the collection included “musings about the spiritual nature of cooking,” said the ruling, in quoting another court decision. But the plaintiffs have “not shown that any aspect of their recipe book is original and would therefore enjoy copyright protection.” #### "

The companies are settling without admitting wrongdoing, the NCUA said. ####  ##### Barclays said on Monday it will include a provision for the settlement in its third-quarter results. ####  ##### ""We are pleased that this matter is resolved,"" Wells Fargo spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson said. ####  ##### The NCUA said the settlements will bring to $2.2 billion its total recoveries from various banks in litigation over faulty mortgage bonds sold to corporate credit unions. The agency, which regulates and supervises federal credit unions, has sued numerous banks to recover losses caused by the collapse of credit unions during the financial crisis. ####  ##### The agency had sued Barclays' U.S. unit Barclays Capital in 2012, accusing it of making false statements in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities sold to U.S. credit unions that later failed. ####  ##### Mortgages backing the securities were much riskier than the offering documents stated, with a ""material percentage"" all but certain to become delinquent or default, the lawsuit said. ####  ##### Wachovia was accused of similar practices in a 2011 lawsuit by the NCUA. ####  ##### The lawsuits sought damages for violations of various state and federal securities laws. ####  ##### Banks that have already paid big settlements include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. The NCUA said it continues to pursue lawsuits against others, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group A.G. and Morgan Stanley. ####  ##### The agency said on Monday it also has litigation pending against securities firms over alleged manipulation of interest rates and for failing to perform their duties as trustees for residential mortgage-backed trusts. #### "
"Allergan unit to plead guilty to health care fraud, pay $125 million";"Risk Management";"Prescription Drug Benefits, D&O, General liability, Health Care Costs";" ##### (Reuters) — Warner Chilcott U.S. Sales L.L.C., now part of Botox maker Allergan P.L.C., agreed to plead guilty to felony health care fraud and pay $125 million to resolve U.S. charges that it paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe several of its drugs. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Justice, which announced the settlement, also said former Warner Chilcott President W. Carl Reichel was arrested in Boston on Thursday and charged with one count of conspiring to pay kickbacks. ####  ##### At least four other people have pleaded guilty or been charged over Warner Chilcott’s activities, the department said. ####  ##### The settlement resolves charges that from 2009 to 2013, Warner Chilcott illegally marketed seven drugs, including Asacol to treat ulcerative colitis, and Actonel and Atelvia to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis. ####  ##### Investigators said this marketing included the making of payments or offering of perks such as expensive restaurant meals to persuade doctors to prescribe the drugs. ####  ##### Warner Chilcott agreed to pay a $22.94 million criminal fine and admit to paying kickbacks, improperly inducing insurers to pay for Atelvia prescriptions, and making unsubstantiated claims about Actonel. ####  ##### It also agreed to pay $102.06 million to the U.S. government and states to resolve civil charges that it caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs. ####  ##### Allergan is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. It said it cooperated with the U.S. probe and had previously set aside funds for the accord. ####  ##### CEO Brent Saunders said in a statement that Allergan is committed to operating “in full compliance with the regulations and high ethical standards we have set.” ####  ##### Mr. Reichel, 57, of Chester, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Boal in Boston, and was released without bail, said his lawyer Joe Savage. ####  ##### “The charges brought today by the U.S. Attorney’s office are false,” said Mr. Savage, a partner at Goodwin Procter. “For more than 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Carl Reichel worked hard and did the right thing, and these baseless claims can’t change that.” ####  ##### Whistleblowers who sued Warner Chilcott under the federal False Claims Act in 2011 will receive $22.9 million from the civil settlement, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### Warner Chilcott was acquired by Actavis P.L.C. in October 2013. Actavis bought Allergan in March 2015 and took its name. ####  ##### Also on Thursday, Allergan confirmed that it is in preliminary talks to merge with drugmaker Pfizer Inc. #### "
"Cable provider Cox pays $595,000 fine to resolve FCC data breach probe";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Cable firm Cox Communications Inc. will pay a $595,000 fine to resolve a Federal Communications Commission investigation as to whether it failed to properly protect its 6 million subscribers’ personal information in connection with a 2014 data breach, the FCC said. ####  ##### Atlanta-based Cox said in a statement its commitment to data security is a top priority, and that only 61 customers were affected by the breach. ####  ##### The FCC said in a statement Thursday that its enforcement bureau’s investigation found that Cox’s electronic data systems were breached in August 2014 by a hacker using the alias “EvilJordie,” a member of the “Lizard Squad” hacker group. ####  ##### The FCC said EvilJordie pretended to be from Cox’s information technology department and convinced both a Cox customer service representative and Cox contractor to enter their account IDs and passwords into a fake “phishing” website. ####  ##### The FCC said with these credentials, the hacker gained unauthorized access to Cox customers’ personally identifiable information, including names, addresses, email addresses, secret questions and answers, PIN numbers and, in some cases, Social Security and driver’s license numbers. ####  ##### The hacker then posted some customers’ information on social media sites, changed some customers’ account passwords and shared the compromised account credentials with another alleged Lizard Squad member, the FCC said. ####  ##### In addition to paying the $595,000 penalty, the settlement also requires Cox to provide all affected customers with one year of free credit monitoring, among other terms. ####  ##### “Cable companies have a wealth of sensitive information about us, from our credit card numbers to our pay-per-view selections,” said Washington-based FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc in the FCC statement. “This investigation shows the real harm that can be done by a digital identity thief with enough information to change your passwords, lock you out of your own accounts, post your personal data on the Web, and harass you through social media. We appreciate that Cox will now take robust steps to keep their customers' information safe online and off.” ####  ##### Cox said in its statement that its “commitment to privacy and data security is a top priority for the company, and we take our responsibility to protect our customers’ personal information very seriously.  While we regret that this incident occurred, our information security program ensured that we were able to react quickly and limit the incident to 61 customers. ####  ##### “Cox also promptly reported the incident to the FBI and worked closely with them in their investigation, resulting in the arrest of the perpetrator.  We will continue to enhance our privacy and information security programs to protect the personal information that is entrusted to us.” ####  ##### Blogger Brian Krebs, who focuses on data breaches, said in his blog Friday that he was among those affected by the breach against Cox, his former Internet provider. #### "

"AIG profit hit by weak underwriting, lower investment income";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, AIG, Canada, China, Financial Results";" ##### (Reuters) — American International Group Inc.’s quarterly operating profit plunged as income at all but one of its underwriting businesses declined and tumultuous markets hurt its investments. ####  ##### AIG, the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, also incurred a hefty $274 million pretax restructuring charge that also hurt results in the quarter. ####  ##### The company said restructuring costs would total $500 million through 2017 as it simplifies its business to eventually save about $400-$500 million a year. ####  ##### AIG shares were down 1.9% after the bell. ####  ##### The company also said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share compared with 12.5 cents a year earlier. ####  ##### The increase in dividend comes less than a week after billionaire Carl Icahn urged AIG to break itself apart, cut costs more aggressively and give back more to shareholders in one of the largest activist campaigns of the year. ####  ##### Mr. Icahn’s proposal, supported by hedge fund manager John Paulson, has sparked talks among AIG directors about spinning off or selling the insurer’s small mortgage-insurance business, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. ####  ##### Operating income after tax tumbled 60% to $691 million, or 52 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, widely missing the average analyst estimate of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ####  ##### Pretax operating income from AIG’s insurance operations slumped 41% to $1.47 billion, as earnings fell in all its underwriting lines but mortgage guarantee insurance. ####  ##### At the commercial property and casualty insurance business, traditionally AIG’s forte, pretax operating income fell 40% to $569 million, hurt by lower investment income and rates. ####  ##### Travelers Cos. Inc., which vies with AIG for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit last month, helped by higher underwriting gains. ####  ##### AIG, which traces its roots to a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also made a $195 million loss from investments in the People’s Insurance Group of China Ltd. and its subsidiary, PICC Property and Casualty Co.

A meme posted to his account says he felt a “pop” in his back during the incident, and he told the mascot to “get off” of him. ####  ##### Mr. Schapira went to a local emergency room soon after Sparky jumped on him, he said via Twitter. Pictures of the accident tweeted by Mr. Schapira show Sparky consoling him while he was doubled over in pain. ####  ##### The Republic says Mr. Schapira suffered a muscle tear that could take up to six months to heal. He is now reportedly seeking about $120,000 in damages from Arizona State in relation to the accident. ####  ##### “There has been no contention behind the scenes whatsoever.

Probably not,” said Mr. Withers-Clarke. ####  ##### Pressure on rates will likely persist through Jan. 1 renewals. ####  ##### “These trends, I think, will likely continue,” said Bryon Ehrhart, CEO of Aon Benfield Americas and chairman, Aon Securities, in Chicago. ####  ##### “People look at years like this with no losses and see additional pressure. That's just natural,” said Mr. Ehrhart. He added that Aon Benfield also does not issue forward guidance, limiting that information to confidential client briefings. ####  ##### “It's been rough, and unfortunately, I don't disagree with these guys,” said Greg Haft, head of worldwide catastrophe reinsurance business for PartnerRe Ltd. in Pembroke, referring to the preceding comments of his fellow panel members. ####  ##### He did, however, offer a ray of hope. ####  ##### “I do think there has been some change,” said Mr. Haft. “In 2015, we saw what I would call a firming of pricing, not a hardening.” #### "
"Low interest rates, rising equities boost global insurer mergers";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Ace, Chubb, Cigna, Mergers & Acquisitions, XL Catlin, Catlin, Health Insurers, Ironshore Inc.";" ##### Global insurer mergers and acquisitions are at the highest level in recent years and are likely to continue at that rate, Moody’s Investors Service Inc. said Tuesday ####  ##### The report, Highest M&A Activity in Years Looks Set to Continue, notes that the total value of 15 insurance M&As during the first nine months of the year totaled more than $200 billion. ####  ##### Ace Ltd.’s acquisition of Chubb Corp., XL Group P.L.C.’s purchase of Catlin Group Ltd., Cigna Corp’s proposed acquisition of Anthem Inc. and Fosun International Ltd.’s purchase of Ironshore Inc. are among higher profile deals so far this year cited by Moody’s. ####  ##### Several factors have driven the spate of transactions, according to Moody’s. They include regulatory change such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States driving health care M&As, low interest rates and rising equity markets, which encourage debt-fueled growth and expansion by Chinese and Japanese companies in search of nondomestic growth opportunities. ####  ##### Moody’s predicts that M&As will continue owing to the fragmented insurance industries in many countries; “continued attractive economic fundamentals in many regions (low interest rates/funding costs and forced sellers,” and the international growth aspirations of many buyers. ####  ##### Moody’s said acquisitions are likely to stop only if interest rates rise significantly and equity markets fall “dramatically.” It added, though, that a drop in equity markets might reduce the sale price of acquisitions. #### "
"One of season's hot toys stuck in hairy dilemma";"Risk Management";"Off Beat";" ##### Oh what tangled hair we weave: Bunchems, “the colorful little balls that stick to each other and build like no other,” according to the company, are giving parents and kids fits because the little hooks that make the balls cling to one another can also cause the balls to become tangled in children’s hair. ####  ##### The Bunchems, expected to be one of the hottest toys of the holiday season, now come with a warning on retailer Amazon.com Inc.’s website about the hair tangling danger. Out of the 219 customer reviews on Amazon’s website, 34% of reviewers gave the toy only one star, with one reviewer saying he spent two and a half hours trying to remove 14 balls from his daughter’s hair and urging fellow Amazon shoppers to “buy this toy for someone if you hate them or their child.” ####  ##### Other Amazon reviewers were more forgiving, with 25% giving the toy five stars and some blaming inattentive parents for the hair tangles. ####  ##### In response to the backlash, Toronto-based Spin Master Ltd., which manufactures the toy, put an instructional video on its website telling parents how to remove the stuck Bunchems from their child’s hair, starting with applying conditioner or vegetable oil, combing below the affected hair areas and then sliding the Bunchems down and off the child’s hair. ####  ##### The video advises parents to repeat the process if they don’t succeed at removing the Bunchems on the first try, but some Amazon reviewers say Spin Master’s conditioner/vegetable oil solution simply does not work and suggest other tools, including pliers and toothpicks, to pry the toys loose. #### "

"Lockheed, FAA give flight to new hybrid airship";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Aviation, Off Beat";" ##### A hybrid airship designed by Lockheed Martin could revolutionize the transport of large cargo to remote sites. ####  ##### Lockheed and the Federal Aviation Administration have worked together for more than a decade to define the criteria to certify hybrid airships for transport, and the FAA has certified the unique, bulbous airships for flight, the company said Tuesday. ####  ##### Thanks to their unique shape and air cushion landing system, hybrid airships can economically transport heavy cargo to and from remote locations. They burn significantly less fuel when compared to conventional aircraft, which makes them environmentally friendly, according to news reports. ####  ##### The airship’s four hovercraft-like air cushioned landing pads allow it to land on a cushion of air onto flat land or water without being required to be moored on large towers like traditional airships. The pad functions can also reverse to grip the ground after landing to keep the airship stable to safely load and unload cargo. The hybrid airship offers the simplicity of a pickup truck by carrying cargo loads and personnel in and out of remote areas daily, not just certain seasons or only after major road, rail or airport infrastructure is developed. ####  ##### Hybrid Enterprises, the airship resellers for Lockheed said the helium filled airship can carry 20 tons of cargo, but can easily be scaled to roughly the size of a football field with 500 tons of capacity. It has a fuel capacity of 5,000 gallons with a range of 1,400 nautical miles, and can cruise at a speed of 60 knots. ####  ##### Lockheed kicked off sales for the 20-ton variety of the hybrid airship earlier this year and is on track to deliver operational airships by as early as 2018. ####  ##### Given that hybrid airships did not fit within existing FAA regulations, a new set of criteria allowing nonrigid hybrid airships to safely operate in a commercial capacity had to be created. Transport Canada was also involved in the development of this criteria to ensure it included safety concerns unique to Canada. #### "
"Aon tries to provide pipeline to Lloyd's syndicates";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, P/C Insurers, Aon, Lloyd's of London, United Kingdom";" ##### Aon P.L.C. has launched two broking initiatives it says will increase retail and wholesale buyers' access to Lloyd's of London, but some are grumbling that the efforts favor some syndicates over others. ####  ##### Aon said it hopes the facilities improve buyers' ability to access Lloyd's instead of local markets. ####  ##### Separately, Lloyd's has launched an effort to modernize and simplify the way it does business to improve its competitive position. ####  ##### Aon introduced its latest effort — a follow-up to a 2013 7.5% quota share facility involving Berkshire Hathaway Inc. that also was criticized — in a Nov. 11 meeting at its London headquarters, where it outlined the proposals for Lloyd's managing agents and Lloyd's CEO Inga Beale. ####  ##### Aon Carrier Link for Lloyd's, which will launch in the first quarter of 2016, opens a distribution channel allowing syndicates to connect directly with Aon's retail network worldwide, Aon said. ####  ##### “By effectively exporting the underwriting appetite of Lloyd's syndicates to its local retail brokers around the world, Aon is opening up an additional retail distribution channel that provides more choice for its clients, while increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the wholesale placement process by focusing that channel on their clients' largest and most complex specialist risks,” Aon said. ####  ##### Aon also announced a treaty-based approach, Aon Client Treaty, that it said is unique and borrows best practices from portfolio broking and underwriting that are common in the reinsurance world and applies them to primary wholesale and retail channels. ####  ##### This treaty — led by XL Catlin and including several Lloyd's syndicates that will offer a 20% line to Aon's wholesale clients — will offer presecured coinsurance capacity and be available to clients with eligible placements on Jan. 1, Aon said. ####  ##### “Aon is committed to innovating on behalf of our clients and excited to be working closely with Lloyd's,” Steve McGill, group president of Aon, said in a statement. ####  ##### “Aon Carrier Link for Lloyd's benefits our clients by exporting the underwriting expertise of Lloyd's underwriters directly to our global retail network, while our first Aon Client Treaty strengthens the subscription market in London and further reinforces Lloyd's as a destination for our clients' largest and most complex risks,” he said. ####  ##### Sources said syndicates that are not part of the initiatives were unhappy about the portfolio underwriting facility that effectively will enable a select number of Lloyd's insurers — about six in all — to offer a 20% line to Aon's wholesale clients. ####  ##### The moves, however, are likely to increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with underwriting subscription market business, sources said. ####  ##### Nondisclosure agreements prevent participants from revealing details of their involvement, sources said. ####  ##### The latest Aon facility effort follows Berkshire Hathaway's withdrawal earlier this year from Aon's 7.5% quota share sidecar, according to sources, and Willis Group Holdings P.L.C.'s Global 360 facility, also launched in 2013. ####  ##### Such facilities drew criticism from some sources who said they represented “blind underwriting” and risked squeezing smaller syndicates off underwriting slips. #### "

Jan. 1, 2016, the retention will increase to £135 million ($205.7 million) for any one event and will be capped at an annual aggregate of £270 million ($411.4 million) any year, a company statement said. The change is to assist in the return of a normalized U.K. terrorism insurance market, after recent events, Pool Re said in a statement. ####  ##### “Our continued goal is to re-engage global capacity in the provision of terrorism cover in Great Britain, said Steve Coates, chief underwriting officer for London-based Pool Re, in the statement. ####  ##### “This process started with the purchase of retrocession cover from global re-insurers in March this year, which saw significant aggregated cover provided in Great Britain for the first time since 1992. Given the industry retention had been unaltered since 2006, there seemed to be scope to return more of the risk to the local market. We will continue to examine ways to secure more capacity from insurers and re-insurers, so as to increase scheme resilience and ensure that Pool Re only provides capacity that the market is unable to.” #### "

"Ballooning claims roil commercial auto sector";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Zurich, Auto liability";" ##### Changing players and increasing claim severity have shaken the commercial auto insurance sector as some insurers retrench amid soaring settlements and awards. ####  ##### Both American International Group Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. addressed commercial auto coverage in their latest results. ####  ##### AIG noted “higher current accident year losses in health care and in U.S. commercial automobile liability.” The company also said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was increasing commercial automobile liability reserves by $402 million for the nine-month period that ended Sept. 30. ####  ##### The company did not respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### Zurich went a step further in its third-quarter release, saying it would “exit two portfolios in global corporate, including part of the U.S. transportation business.” ####  ##### In response to questions, Zurich said last week it will no longer offer casualty cover for U.S. companies in three categories. ####  ##### “The majority of the business is long-haul trucking and some passenger transport services,” Zurich said in a statement. “Zurich is not exiting the U.S. auto liability, auto physical damage, workers compensation or general liability markets.” ####  ##### “There are carriers that had pretty adverse results and are taking, from what we see, pretty drastic action in the marketplace,” said Bill Smyth, vice president of casualty at Berkshire Hathaway Specialty in Boston, which runs the company's excess trucking and transportation book of business. ####  ##### “Obviously, some of the legacy carriers are feeling the pinch,” said Tony DeFelice, managing director of Aon Risk Solutions' national casualty practice in New York. ####  ##### One factor roiling the commercial auto market is an increase in severe claims, sources said. ####  ##### “I do believe that we have seen massive increases in terms of severity on auto,” Mr. DeFelice said. “Over the past year, I myself have witnessed about five large auto liability claims ranging from $7 to $8 million all the way up to $50 million.” ####  ##### Dan Aronson, U.S. primary casualty placement leader at Marsh L.L.C. in New York, cited an example of rising costs in auto claims. ####  ##### “Ten years ago we would have said that a large commercial auto claim would be $10 million dollars,” said Mr. Aronson. “Well, $10 million became $20 million, which became $30 million, and we've now seen some cases as high as $40 million, if not more, in the past couple of years.” ####  ##### “There have been some notable cases which have had astronomical settlement values in excess of $25 million and upwards,” said Pamela Ferrandino, national casualty practice leader at Willis North America Inc. in New York. “Those are big numbers, and it's very hard to differentiate a favorable risk from an average risk, no matter what your rate on line is, to ever price for that sort of volatility of loss.” ####  ##### “Everyone is agreeing that severity is an issue,” said Tracy Dolin-Benguigui, director of financial services ratings of North American insurance at Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. ####  ##### One key driver of costs is medical care as safer cars are allowing people to survive accidents that previously may have been fatal. ####  ##### “People survive accidents, but with absolutely critical injuries which require lifelong care; and the value of those lifelong care plans has dramatically skyrocketed in recent years,” said Steve Hackenburg, chief broking officer of national casualty at Aon Risk Solutions in New York. ####  ##### “Severity continues to be impacted by the rising cost of medical care,” said Steve Assennata, senior vice president and head of the client group specialty markets at Munich Reinsurance America Inc. ####  ##### “If you think about the average auto loss of significance, a big component of that is medical loss,” said Debbie Michel, executive vice president of national casualty for Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. in Chicago. ####  ##### General loss costs have also increased, some 4.0% in 2013, then 7.0% in 2014 and 8.0% in 2015, added Ms. Michel. ####  ##### As some insurers have moved to stem such losses and reduce their commercial auto business, others have seen opportunity. ####  ##### “Our growth through July of this year was about a 40% growth rate in terms of premium,” said Berkshire's Mr. Smyth. “If you look through the end of October, that doubled.” ####  ##### “We didn't write nearly as much in the first seven months as we have in the last three months,” said Mr. Smyth. ####  ##### That growth seems poised to continue. ####  ##### “The number of submissions, the number of requests and the number of folks who have come to track us down and say, 'Hey, we really want a quote from you,' has changed dramatically,” said Mr. Smyth. ####  ##### Berkshire Specialty has “been building out their infrastructure and ramping up production and in 2015 it continued to expand quite a bit,” said John Iten, a director at S&P, of Berkshire Specialty's overall business. ####  ##### Renewals amid the changes have varied. ####  ##### While 15% of clients saw rate increases, 23% saw rate decreases, and the largest group by far, 62%, renewed flat, said Aon's Mr. Hackenburg. ####  ##### “Today we are in what I would consider to be a flat rate environment,” said Ms. Ferrandino. ####  ##### Several sources agreed that there was ample capacity available and the sector remained competitive, allowing many clients to renew coverage without rate increases. ####  ##### “When I look at the spread of rate on our book of business, it's not like everyone is at plus 3% — there's good spread, just like there should be,” said Ms. Michel. #### "
"Honda, Takata settle airbag suits, lose round in class action case";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Auto liability, D&O, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. judge has rejected a bid by air bag manufacturer Takata Corp. and automaker Honda Motor Co. to toss out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of millions of owners with potentially faulty airbag inflators, even as the firms are moving to quickly settle death claims. ####  ##### The Japanese companies have agreed to undisclosed settlements for six of eight deaths linked to ruptured inflators as U.S. prosecutors ramp up a probe of the ruptures and whether regulators were misled. Four settlements have been reached in recent months. ####  ##### Litigation arising from four of the six U.S. deaths has been settled, Honda spokesman Chris Martin said. Court records show a fifth U.S. death — in September 2014 in California — has also been settled. ####  ##### Honda has been working to settle claims quickly, Mr. Martin said. “Honda has worked in good faith to quickly resolve the concerns of those families,” he said. ####  ##### Honda, Takata and other automakers will continue to face a class-action suit filed on behalf of millions of owners that alleges Takata and the automakers violated anti-racketeering laws because of a ruling on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami. ####  ##### Since 2008, at least 19.2 million U.S. vehicles have been recalled for inflators that can rupture. The suit claims millions of car owners overpaid for vehicles with faulty airbags and the recalls reduced the value of those vehicles. ####  ##### “Honda looks forward to the opportunity to properly challenge plaintiffs’ claims,” Honda’s Mr. Martin said. He said the automaker is confident that the racketeering claim will be dismissed. ####  ##### Takata declined to comment on the ruling. ####  ##### The airbag manufacturer has bolstered its legal team. Lanny Breuer, a partner at Covington & Burling L.L.P. who served as U.S. assistant attorney general overseeing the criminal division from 2009-2013, said in a court filing in November that he was representing Takata in the civil lawsuit. ####  ##### The previously unreported civil settlements cover five airbag deaths in the United States — including two reported inflator deaths this year in Texas and Louisiana — and a 2014 incident in Malaysia in which a pregnant woman was killed and her baby subsequently died. Judge Moreno approved that settlement on Nov. 20. ####  ##### U.S. prosecutors have conducted interviews with Takata and Honda employees in both Japan and the United States, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit declined to comment. ####  ##### Mr. Martin declined to say if executives have been interviewed but said “Honda is actively cooperating with the DOJ investigation of Takata.” ####  ##### A federal grand jury has subpoenaed documents from Takata, but Honda said it has not received a grand jury subpoena. ####  ##### Honda has confirmed seven airbag deaths since 2009. An inflator is also suspected in the 2013 death of a California man in a 2002 Acura TL. #### "
"Positive 2016 results predicted for commercial insurers";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Mergers & Acquisitions, Financial Results";" ##### The U.S. commercial insurance industry will continue to see positive gains in 2016, according to a report published by Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA Inc. ####  ##### The company’s 2016 Market Outlook report, released Tuesday, indicated that favorable losses across most insurance lines and a lack in catastrophe property claims will provide positive underwriting gains in 2016. ####  ##### Some of the key findings in the report noted that gross domestic product was expected to continue to grow in 2016, though not as much as the previous two years, resulting in continued higher revenues, payrolls, and property values, which would be reflected in insurance premiums. ####  ##### Higher investment returns from rising interest rates should give insurers higher investment returns as well, the report said. ####  ##### The report found the insurance industry increasingly using data analysis to find loss trends, although it said it is not known if the data is being interpreted objectively or accurately. ####  ##### The report stated the continuation of mergers and acquisitions in the insurance and reinsurance market made achieving profitable organic growth difficult. ####  ##### “We expected M&A activity all along, but the magnitude of that activity, what with ACE-Chubb and XL-Catlin mergers, was much larger than we anticipated,” said Doug O’Brien, Wells Fargo’s New York-based casualty and alternative risk national practice leader. ####  ##### “Certain markets will enter into new product lines, which can prolong a buyer’s market,” he said. ####  ##### “I think it’s going to be more pronounced next year; as markets struggle to deploy their capacity, new product offerings and M&A are good for the marketplace,” he said. #### "

"AIG attempts balancing act amid pressures";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, AIG";" ##### American International Group Inc. will have to balance shareholder demands for profit and client desires for more product innovation to emerge successfully from its current woes. ####  ##### The New York-based insurer said four key executives — Commercial Insurance CEO John Doyle, Chief Financial Officer David Herzog, CEO of the Asia Pacific Region Jose Hernandez and Executive Vice President of Claims and Operations Eric Martinez — would leave. ####  ##### The December announcement came just weeks after AIG posted a third-quarter loss of $231 million. In an earnings call after releasing its results, President and CEO Peter Hancock said AIG planned to cut 23% of its 1,400 senior management positions, with further layoffs likely in 2016. ####  ##### The cost-cutting moves followed repeated calls by investor Carl Icahn that AIG be split into three separate entities — property/casualty, life and mortgage — to enhance shareholder value and allow it to get rid of its federally imposed systemically important financial institution designation. ####  ##### Although Mr. Hancock met with Mr. Icahn, no divestiture plan was announced. ####  ##### However, AIG subsequently said it would sell some of its stake in Chinese insurer PICC Property & Casualty Co. Ltd. in a deal worth nearly $752 million. ####  ##### The cost-cutting moves have raised questions among some risk managers and others whether AIG is backing away from its tradition of innovative products and services. In fact, some say the company already has softened its focus on innovation. ####  ##### “You just haven’t seen the innovation you used to see,” said a risk manager who asked not to be named. “It’s been very subtle. I would agree that they are not emphasizing new products.” ####  ##### “AIG is clearly in a defensive hunkered-down mode,” a broker who asked not to be named said. “People are scared for their jobs; and when you spend that much time behind closed doors trying to protect yourself, it doesn’t leave a lot of time to be responsive to the brokers or creative in the marketplace.” ####  ##### “They’re reducing their management structure to make it more nimble and, from a risk manager’s perspective, that’s a good thing,” said another risk manager who asked not to be identified. “If there is more access to senior management, that’s a positive. If the consequence of that is almost a commoditization of the product, they will be a less attractive option to the risk managers who deal with them because of a loss of their creativity in crafting unique solutions for large commercial insurance buyers.” ####  ##### A spokesman for AIG stressed, however, that the company remains committed to innovation in the marketplace. ####  ##### “AIG continues to be a leading innovator,” he said. ####  ##### “Whether you look at our lead position in cyber insurance and cyber risk management, the extensive build-out of our engineering capabilities, expanded use of (insurance-linked securities), large property limits, the industry’s first science team, data analytics, and our focus on emerging disruptive forces including the sharing economy, drones, the Internet of Things and driverless cars, AIG continues to be a thought leader in the market and product innovator for our clients,” he said. ####  ##### “Cost-cutting and innovation are not mutually exclusive,” said John Phelps, director of business risk solutions at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida Inc. in Jacksonville. “The health insurance industry is a perfect example of that. AIG senior leadership has to figure out the strategy that will allow them to continue to be innovative and meet marketplace demands while in a cost-cutting environment.” ####  ##### An equities analyst made much the same point. ####  ##### “AIG has been an innovative company for many, many years. The challenge will be as it navigates these difficult times to balance shareholders’ need for high margins against the need to invest in delivering value to customers and creating new innovative products and services,” said Josh Stirling, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein L.L.C. in New York. ####  ##### “It’s something you always need to be very careful about,” said Cliff Gallant, an analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc. in San Francisco. “Looking at their expense structure, it does seem they’re a little bloated and there’s need for expense cuts.” ####  ##### Still, “I think everybody brings something to the table, and AIG is known for having a lot of management experience and talent, and you don’t want to cut the wrong person. It’s always a risk when you’re going through something like this that you’ll lose some of your competitive edge. That’s one of the chief responsibilities of the CEO — in this case, Peter Hancock.” Mr. Gallant said Mr. Hancock “needs to make those calls on those positions, and there’s a lot of pressure on him.” ####  ##### One risk manager expressed concern over staff cuts already made and yet to come. ####  ##### “I am very disappointed to hear about John Doyle leaving AIG,” said Carolyn Snow, director of risk management at Humana Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. “He’s been a really good friend to Humana, and I’m sure a lot of other commercial accounts. I think his expertise and collaboration will be greatly missed.” #### "
"RIMS' new risk certification program exam April 10";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Risk Management";" ##### The Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. on Friday launched its risk management professional certification program. ####  ##### RIMS plans to administer its first in-person RIMS-CRMP (Certified Risk Management Professional) exam on April 10, 2016 in San Diego for RIMS members with either a bachelor's degree (or global equivalent) in risk management and one year working full-time in risk management or a bachelor's (or global equivalent) in a non-risk management related field and three years of full-time employment in risk management, a statement said. ####  ##### For members without a bachelor's degree, seven years of risk management is required. Possessing an associate's degree in Risk Management (ARM) and/or a Canadian Risk Management (CRM) designation counts as two years of risk management experience. ####  ##### “The RIMS-CRMP is intended to boost practitioners' professional standing and confirm their value to leadership,” Rick Roberts, RIMS president said in the statement. ####  ##### There is limited availability for the exam. Additional online exams will be offered at an increased registration fee after the San Diego exam. ####  ##### In October of this year, the Federation of European Risk Management Associations launched its professional certification program for risk managers in Europe, known as rimap. #### "
"JetBlue crew member's ADA lawsuit reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, Disability, General liability";" ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by an inflight crew member against JetBlue Airways Inc., stating she has successfully argued she was disabled and may have been fired because of it. ####  ##### Shari Dooley was terminated by JetBlue in September 2013 because she had allegedly violated company policy regarding attendance or dependability, according to court papers in Shari Dooley v. JetBlue Airways Corp. ####  ##### Ms. Dooley filed suit in U.S. District Court in New York in June 2014, alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, among other charges. The court dismissed the case and Ms. Dooley appealed. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reinstated Ms. Dooley’s ADA claim on Friday. Ms. Dooley, who said she had suffered a fracture and has nerve damage, has plausibly claimed she was disabled, said the ruling. ####  ##### The circumstances of her termination also raise an inference of discrimination, said the appeals court. JetBlue ordinarily follows a progressive discipline policy regarding dependability that includes a multistep process, but Ms. Dooley was not afforded any of these steps, said the ruling. ####  ##### “When coupled with the closeness in time between the injury that caused her alleged disability and JetBlue’s initiation of the process that ultimately resulted in her firing (alleging that Dooley was ‘suspended without pay pending an investigation of dependability’ approximately two months after she was injured and fired approximately one-and-a-half months thereafter) these allegations ‘give plausible support to a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation,’” said the court in quoting an earlier ruling. ####  ##### The appeals court did affirm the District Court’s dismissal of several other charges, including a failure to accommodate under the ADA and retaliation and discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### In August, an appeals court reinstated an ADA discrimination charge in a case where a company official allegedly sought reasons to fire a worker after he had already decided to terminate her because of her disability. #### "

"FTC's cyber security win against Wyndham may lead to more enforcement actions";"Risk Management";"";" ##### The Federal Trade Commission's settlement of its lawsuit against Wyndham Worldwide Corp. in connection with the hotel chain's cyber breaches is likely to encourage further FTC action and enforcement in this area. ####  ##### The FTC had charged Parsippany, New Jersey-based Wyndham in its 2012 lawsuit with failing to properly safeguard consumer information held by its hotels, allowing intruders to gain unauthorized access to its computer network three times between April 2008 and January 2010. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 3rd US. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia unanimously held in August that the FTC had authority to regulate corporate cyber security and could pursue the lawsuit, without ruling on the lawsuit's merits. ####  ##### The settlement announced last week requires Wyndham to establish a comprehensive information security program designed to protect cardholder data but does not require the company to pay any fines. ####  ##### “It's a very big deal,” said Stephen J. Newman, a partner with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan L.L.P. in Los Angeles. “Wyndham was fighting very hard, and I think a lot of people were anticipating that they were going to try to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this.” ####  ##### That Wyndham accepted the FTC's complete jurisdiction over it is a “real feather in the (the FTC's) cap,” Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Mr. Newman said he believes Wyndham agreed to the settlement because “the deal did not require them to pay any money in penalties or investigative costs, and certainly Wyndham can walk away with their head held high in that they weren't writing a check.” ####  ##### FTC will become more aggressive as a result of the settlement, Mr. Newman said. The FTC won on this issue in the 3rd Circuit “and with Wyndham abandoning the fight, I don't see anyone else mounting a serious challenge to the FTC's authority in this area,” he said. “I think they will be much more vigorous in their enforcement efforts here.” ####  ##### “I think they'll at least pick up the pace, if not become more active,” said Mary Ellen Callahan, a partner with Jenner & Block L.L.P. in Washington. There was a “bit of a lull” while the Wyndham case was pending, she said. ####  ##### Under terms of the 20-year settlement agreement, the company must establish a comprehensive cyber security program and conduct annual information security audits of its program that conform to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard for certification of a company's security program. It must also maintain safeguards in connection to its franchisees' servers. ####  ##### Referring to the requirement on the payment card industry standard, Ms. Callahan said there has been a lot of discussion that the standard is insufficient. ####  ##### Many of the companies that have been breached followed this standard “and to use that as your baseline almost concedes that the paradigm isn't perfect,” said Ms. Callahan, who is former chief privacy officer for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ####  ##### But, “If you agree to these objective third party-standards, you're good enough, even if being good enough means you can be subject to a breach,” she said. ####  ##### “The FTC may want to make sure there are objective standards on which they can judge any of the companies,” Ms. Callahan said. ####  ##### FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in the FTC's statement that the settlement “marks the end of a significant case in the FTC's efforts to protect consumers from the harm caused by unreasonable data security.” ####  ##### “Not only will it provide important protection to consumers, but the court rulings in the case have affirmed the vital role the FTC plays in this important area,” she added. ####  ##### Wyndham said in a statement, “We chose to defend against this litigation based on our strong belief that we have had reasonable data security in place, and that the FTC's position could have had a negative impact on the franchise business model. ####  ##### “This settlement resolves these issues, and sets a standard for what the government considers reasonable data security of payment card information. ####  ##### “Safeguarding personal information remains a top priority for our company at a time when companies and government agencies are increasingly the targets of cyber attacks,” said the company. #### "
"Integro unit buys London entertainment insurance broker ";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Risk Management, United Kingdom, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### Integro Insurance Brokers Holdings Ltd., a unit of Integro Ltd., has acquired London-based entertainment and sports brokerage Entertainment Insurance Partners Ltd., New York-based Integro announced Monday. ####  ##### Terms of the deal were not disclosed. ####  ##### EIP provides insurance and risk management services to artists, promoters, venues, and productions across the world.

"Hello Barbie has it all — including cyber risks";"Risk Management";"Off Beat";" ##### Toymaker Mattel Inc. is trying to bring its iconic Barbie doll into the digital age by creating an interactive version that will actually talk back when children speak to their dolls. But due to security issues, so can hackers. ####  ##### Mattel introduced the original Barbie at the annual Toy Fair in New York in March 1959 and unveiled the Hello Barbie version in late November of this year, just in time for the holidays. Using Wi-Fi and speech recognition technology, Hello Barbie can hold conversations, play games, share stories and tell jokes, according to the company. The doll sells for about $70 on retailer Amazon.com's website. ####  ##### Security firm Bluebox discovered several issues with the Hello Barbie app, including that the app can be modified to reveal confidential information such as authentication credential passwords, according to a white paper released last week by the firm. The app will also connect a mobile device to any unsecured Wi-Fi network if it has Barbie in the name, allowing for a network spoofing attack to occur by an attacker impersonating the Barbie network to steal data, according to the white paper. ####  ##### The Hello Barbie app utilizes an authentication credential that can be re-used by attackers and also shipped with unused code that serves no function, but increases the overall attack surface, according to the white paper. ####  ##### In addition, the Bluebox analysis identified server-side security issues, including that the ToyTalk server domain was on a cloud infrastructure susceptible to the POODLE attack — an exploit that takes advantage of the way some browsers deal with encryption. This would allow attackers to downgrade connection security and listen in on communications to the server such as uploaded conversations from the doll. Bluebox informed ToyTalk of these vulnerabilities, and the company has quickly resolved several issues, according to the white paper. ####  ##### Bluebox wasn't the first to identify a security flaw with Hello Barbie. Researcher Matt Jakubowski previously said he'd discovered a flaw that would potentially allow hackers to pinpoint home addresses of doll owners. ####  ##### Barbie isn't the only toy that's run into safety or privacy concerns related to its Internet connection. Hackers recently stole the account information of more than 6.4 million children who use the Learning Lodge app store for VTech Holdings Ltd. toys. #### "
"McDonald's charged by EEOC after canceling interview for deaf job-seeker";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### McDonald’s Corp. has been charged with disability discrimination by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for refusing to provide a sign language interpreter for a deaf employee candidate. ####  ##### Ricky Washington, who is deaf, applied online for a job at a McDonald’s restaurant in Belton, Missouri, in June 2012. When the Belton restaurant manager learned Mr. Washington needed a sign language interpreter for his job interview, she canceled the interview and never rescheduled it, despite Mr. Washington’s sister volunteering to act as the interpreter, the EEOC said in a statement issued Monday. ####  ##### Mr. Washington indicated on his application that he attended Kansas School for the Deaf and that he also had previous job experience working as a cook and clean-up team member at a McDonald's restaurant in Louisiana in 2009. ####  ##### Restaurant management continued to interview and hire new workers after Mr. Washington made several attempts to schedule an interview, according to the agency. ####  ##### After first attempting to reach a prelitigation settlement through its conciliation process, the EEOC charged Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s Corp. and McDonald’s Restaurants of Missouri Inc. in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Missouri, with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by refusing to accommodate and hire a deaf applicant. ####  ##### “Removing obstacles in the hiring process for people with disabilities is a national priority for EEOC,” said James R. Neely Jr., EEOC’s St. Louis district director. “All employers, but especially large ones, should join with the agency to make sure everyone has equal access to the employment process.” ####  ##### The Belton restaurant where Mr. Washington applied for work is owned and operated by McDonald’s Corp., the statement said. #### "
"Hillshire Brands to pay $4 million to settle race bias case";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Hillshire Brands Co., formerly known as Sara Lee Corp., has agreed to pay $4 million to settle a race discrimination suit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency said Tuesday. ####  ##### The EEOC claimed that from August 2001 to November 2011, African-American employees in the former Sara Lee facility in Paris, Texas, were subjected to racist graffiti on the walls of the bathrooms and locker room, the agency said in a statement. Former bakery employees also alleged that during work hours they were berated with racial slurs by supervisors and other white co-workers, and that complaints by the plant workers went unaddressed by management. ####  ##### The EEOC filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Marshall, Texas, in July alleging race discrimination in the workplace, including race harassment. ####  ##### “The Commission completed an extensive investigation at the Sara Lee plant, which included conducting interviews with the former bakery workers,” Meaghan L. Shepard, trial attorney for the EEOC’s Dallas district, said in the statement. “EEOC determined racial slurs and graffiti continued at the facility in Paris for years, until the doors finally closed in November 2011.” ####  ##### Under terms of the settlement, in addition to paying $4 million, the company agreed to implement various preventive approaches regarding discrimination or harassment against any employee on the basis of race and will periodically report incidents or investigations to the EEOC. Hillshire Brands also agreed to engage in remedial measures such as anti-discrimination training and implementation of procedures to prevent and promptly address graffiti issues, according to the statement. ####  ##### “African-American workers on the Sara Lee bakery production lines in Paris felt embarrassed and intimidated by the graffiti in the bathroom and the racial slurs on the production floor,” Suzanne Anderson, EEOC’s supervisory trial attorney, said in the statement. “Strong corporate policies and quick remedial action protects against this type of workplace discrimination.” ####  ##### Sara Lee was renamed Hillshire Brands in a 2012 corporate restructuring. #### "

"Major event needed to disrupt pricing status quo";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, P/C Pricing";" ##### What would it take to turn the commercial property insurance market, which is now in its third year of rate cuts? ####  ##### Maybe more than just a single event, according to observers. ####  ##### “It's going to take a major unexpected event or events to change the market,” said Joe Tinetti, Zurich North America's New York-based head of property for global corporate in North America. ####  ##### And how big would that event or series of events need to be? ####  ##### “We're calling for an event we've never seen,” such as an “outrageous California” earthquake or a direct hit on Miami by a Category 5 hurricane, said Dave Finnis, national property practice leader at Willis North America Inc. in Atlanta. ####  ##### “The markets that pay that loss have to take corrective action against a market loss that hadn't been experience before,” he said. ####  ##### He said that underwriters that don't pay for the loss, should it happen, “will see that as an opportunity to pounce,” which in turn would temper any increase from the market. ####  ##### Mr. Finnis said that an event that occurred outside of the property insurance market could also change the marketplace. ####  ##### “Something that really takes a hit on the balance sheets of all the companies, like a huge cyber event,” he said. ####  ##### Hedge fund activity is driving the cheap reinsurance available to the property insurance market, said Mike Martin, executive vice president and general manager of national insurance property at Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. in Boston. He said if the hedge funds decide to put their money into other investments, the hedge fund money would disappear. #### "
"Little urgency expected in Congress";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes";" ##### There looks to be a limited risk management-related agenda at the congressional level this year. ####  ##### That's not because of the relative merits of issues such as reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program or dealing with international insurance regulatory initiatives. Rather, it's the political reality of national elections and a short legislative calendar. ####  ##### “We have to be realistic about a presidential election year, particularly one like this one with divided Congress and administration,” said Joel Wood, senior vice president of the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers in Washington. “I do not believe there will be a vast agenda.” ####  ##### But for Mr. Wood and others, there still could be significant actions on both the legislative and regulatory fronts. Observers expect a congressional discussion about international insurance regulatory efforts, and perhaps some movement on allowing certain risk retention groups to offer property coverage. ####  ##### Perhaps the biggest risk management-related issue will be laying the groundwork for the reauthorization of the NFIP, which is slated to expire Sept. 30, 2017. ####  ##### There will be “a lot of motion and maybe some action” on NFIP reauthorization, said Nat Wienecke, senior vice president in the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America's Washington office. The program will be the subject of a series of hearings in 2016. ####  ##### There will be “basically a yearlong conversation,” he said. “I don't expect legislation to be introduced. ####  ##### “We're already seeing preparation by all the major stakeholders in NFIP,” said Mr. Wood. “Barring any major flood event, we still are going to see a very significant battle on this.” ####  ##### He said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, and Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., “will light themselves on fire before they lift the borrowing limits in the absence of significant actuarially sound reform” of the program. ####  ##### Related to the NFIP is legislation that would promote predisaster mitigation efforts rather than post-catastrophe relief. ####  ##### “We've been calling on Congress to create a national mitigation investment strategy. I think we'll see a package introduced that is a good first step” in dedicating more resources to be spent predisaster, said Jimi Grande, senior vice president of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Cos. Washington office. ####  ##### Mr. Wood said allowing RRGs to write property coverage “may go somewhere.” ####  ##### But Charles Symington, senior vice president of the Alexandria, Virginia-based Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, said his group opposes such a move for RRGs, which now are limited to liability coverage. ####  ##### “There's no marketplace crisis, and we think it's bad public policy in light of the very light regulation RRGs have compared to traditional insurers,” he said. ####  ##### The New York-based Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. wishes to block another legislative effort. That's an attempt disallow the deduction for excess nontaxed reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., has introduced legislation in the past to make the change, which is backed by the Obama administration. ####  ##### “The legislation has come and gone over the years, and we continue to be opposed to it,” said Janice Ochenkowski, a former RIMS president and now chair of the risk management group's external affairs committee. “We're concerned it might gain some traction in this shortened year.” ####  ##### Several observers believe Congress may address the issue of international insurance regulation during this shortened legislative year. ####  ##### “We're seeing very strong signs of congressional actions to rebalance some of the international and domestic actions on insurance regulations,” said Dave Snyder, a PCI vice president. His colleague, Mr. Wienecke, said concerns about international standards being imposed on U.S. insurers are “as bipartisan as they can be.” ####  ##### On the regulatory side, “the work by the Federal Reserve on domestic group capital standards has to get done,” said Leigh Ann Pusey, president and CEO of the American Insurance Association in Washington. ####  ##### “There is an expectation that the Fed will begin a process and put out a rule for comment,” she said. “It needs to get done before any global insurance capital standard is finalized.” ####  ##### Also of concern to agents and brokers on the regulatory side is implementation of the National Association of Registered Agents & Brokers, which is to streamline licensing procedures for nonresident agents, said Mr. Symington. President Barack Obama has yet to nominate members to the board. ####  ##### “We're hopeful that early next year we'll have some names put forth for Senate consideration so they can start the real work, a lot of foundational work. First and foremost, we have to get the right people on that board,” Mr. Symington said. #### "

The FAA is required to investigate complaints of violations involving flight safety and can issue sanctions to airmen and air carriers for noncompliance, while OSHA is required to investigate employee complaints of discrimination and may order a violation if necessary. ####  ##### OSHA agreed to notify the FAA of any discrimination complaints filed with the Department of Labor under the act and will promptly provide FAA with a copy of the complaint, including contact information for the individual filing the complaint, the memorandum states. ####  ##### Likewise, the FAA agrees to promptly provide OSHA with a copy of any complaint of alleged discrimination that involves air carrier safety, including contact information for the individual filing the complaint. ####  ##### OSHA and the FAA also agreed to give each other a complaint summary at least every quarter, and to meet at least once a year to discuss the performance under the memorandum, investigation coordination issues, and other potential whistleblower investigation improvements beneficial to both agencies, the memorandum said. #### "
"Business interruption remains most feared risk; market vagaries rank second";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Terrorism, Allianz, Political Risk, Emerging Risks, General liability, Property, Technology";" ##### Business interruption tops the list of global business risks, according to Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty S.E.'s 2016 Allianz Risk Barometer, released Wednesday. ####  ##### That was the same rank business interruption held in the 2015 survey. But a newcomer — market developments such as volatility, intensified competition and market stagnation — ranked second. Cyber incidents climbed up from fifth place to third place among the top business risks. ####  ##### Rounding out the top 10 were natural catastrophes, changes in legislation and regulation, microeconomic developments such as austerity programs, loss of reputation or brand value, fire and explosion, political risk including terrorism, and theft, fraud and corruption. ####  ##### The fifth annual index result is based on the responses of more than 800 global businesses, risk consultants, underwriters, senior managers and claims experts in the corporate insurance segment in both AGCS and local Allianz offices in October and November of 2015. #### "
"Operating margins, technology to drive insurer trends in 2016";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, P/C Pricing, Technology";" ##### Insurers will see margin pressure in 2016, and technology will continue to take center stage, according to a report released Monday by S&P Capital IQ. ####  ##### With the exception of life insurers, which saw margins expand 138 basis points to 9.68%, year-to-date operating margins for most insurers contracted through Sept. 30, said the New York-based division of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., citing data from SNL Financial L.C. Hardest hit were multiline insurers, where operating margins were down 196 basis points to 10.46%. ####  ##### This could force insurers to pare business, said the report, “Marketscope Advisor Trends & Ideas: Insurance Predictions for 2016.” ####  ##### “Many insurers may be forced to conclude that a broad-based product and segment strategy is no longer a viable business model. Many will trim product offerings, selling or running off noncore and underperforming lines of business,” S&P Capital IQ said in its report. ####  ##### Technology will continue to have a substantial impact on the industry. ####  ##### While “The insurance industry remains heavily dependent on third-party intermediaries — agents and brokers — to market and distribute their products,” S&P Capital IQ notes in its report that “a growing number of consumers prefer to research products and make purchases online,” meaning that the “degree to which an insurer is able to meet these shifts in purchasing trends will be a key competitive factor.” ####  ##### Technology will also affect competition, S&P Capital IQ said. ####  ##### “Tech innovations like Policy Genius and Google Compare, shopping sites which allow consumers to compare policies, are two examples. While these sites may help insurers increase their online presence, they also serve to further commoditize insurance products,” the report said. #### "
"Trader Joe's not trading fair with its canned tuna";"Risk Management";"Regulation, Risk Management, General liability, Off Beat";" ##### Cool specialty grocery store chain Trader Joe's appears to be cheating tuna lovers without their knowledge, selling tuna cans in their stores in underfilled cans — and that's not cool. ####  ##### It's also illegal. ####  ##### A class action lawsuit against Trader Joe's was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Jan. 5. The suit accuses Trader Joe's of underfilling 5-ounce cans of its store-brand tuna, which is in violation of the federally mandated minimum standard fill of 3.23 ounces for these cans, said court documents. ####  ##### According to government standards, a 5-ounce can of tuna must contain at least 3.23 ounces of meat (or 2.84 ounces, in the case of Skipjack tuna). But Trader Joe's canned tuna weighed in at an average of roughly 17% below the federally mandated minimums across six tested store brand varieties. ####  ##### Tests by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed the cans had an average of only about 2.43 ounces to 2.87 ounces of tuna, depending on the tuna version, according to court documents. Two 24-can samples of tuna versions with reduced salt and no salt were found to be almost 25% below required federally mandated fill standards. ####  ##### The Monrovia, California-based grocery store company is involved in the processing, packaging and distribution of its tuna, according to court documents. ####  ##### The named plaintiff filing the class action lawsuit, Sarah Magier, a citizen of New York, had purchased a no-salt can at the end of 2013. #### "

Chief Executive Matthias Mueller has cast doubt on a report last week that said many managers at the German carmaker knew of, or were involved in, developing emissions test-rigging devices. ####  ##### Volkswagen's development of software to cheat diesel-emissions tests was an open secret in its engine development department, Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Jan. 22, citing results from VW's internal probe. ####  ##### The newspaper, which researched the matter with regional broadcasters NDR and WDR, cited a whistleblower whom they said was himself involved in the deception and had testified to investigators hired by VW. ####  ##### ""No one has spoken with me,"" Mr. Mueller told reporters on Thursday at a reception of auto executives. ""You got the information from some sources who have no idea about the whole matter."" ####  ##### Mr. Mueller also damped expectations VW could release the first public results of an investigation into the scandal by U.S. law firm Jones Day before its shareholders' annual general meeting on April 21. ####  ##### Top players on the German manufacturer's supervisory board will hold their third meeting in three weeks on Wednesday as they continue to grapple with the scandal more than four months after it broke, sources have said. ####  ##### ""Is it really so difficult to accept that we are obliged by stock market law to submit a report to the AGM on April 21 and that it is not possible for us to say anything beforehand?"" the CEO asked. #### "
"Zurich Insurance poaches Generali chief Mario Greco";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Zurich, Italy, Switzerland";" ##### (Reuters) — Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. has poached Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. CEO Mario Greco in a move the Swiss insurer hopes will revive its fortunes and which leaves its Italian rival searching for a worthy successor. ####  ##### Underscoring the challenges awaiting Mr. Greco after he engineered a rapid turnaround at Generali, Zurich issued a profit warning last week for its general insurance business, its second in four months. ####  ##### ""Like many global players, the company has faced market challenges in recent times but I know that Zurich's strong global franchise, the breadth of talent and the powerful brand provide all of the ingredients for our future success,"" Mr. Greco said in a statement announcing his appointment as CEO at Zurich. ####  ##### A source had said Mr. Greco's decision to leave Generali was due to personal reasons and not to differences with shareholders of the Italian insurer. Regardless, Bernstein analyst Thomas Seidl said his departure was bad news for Generali. ####  ##### ""The market liked Greco and that helped mitigate the downside for the shares. Now there's room for the stock to fall closer to its €13 ($14) fair value,"" Mr. Seidl said. ####  ##### Generali shares closed down 3.15% at €14.15 ($15.28) on Tuesday, while Zurich shares rose 0.6%. ####  ##### Speculation that Mr. Greco might move to Zurich has been bubbling since mid-December. He ran the Swiss company's main general insurance business before joining Generali in August 2012 and will return as chief executive on May 1. ####  ##### Mr. Greco's return to Zurich had been reported earlier by Reuters. ####  ##### Turnaround architect ####  ##### Zurich had looked at external candidates for the CEO spot to replace Martin Senn, who quit on Dec. 1 following a failed takeover bid for Britain's RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. Chairman Tom de Swaan had held the role on an interim basis. ####  ##### Mr. Greco, who started his career at consultancy firm McKinsey & Co., took over at Generali at the height of the eurozone debt crisis after a boardroom coup ousted his predecessor. ####  ##### The 56-year-old executive, a competitive road cyclist in his free time, is widely seen as the architect of a rapid turnaround that helped almost double the insurer's share price. ####  ##### Under his stewardship, Generali sold assets worth €4 billion ($4.32 billion), cut costs and bolstered capital ahead of new, tougher European solvency rules. ####  ##### Generali, 13.5% owned by influential investment bank Mediobanca, will have to find a successor to steer it through solvency capital requirements which kicked in this year. ####  ##### ""Generali's capital situation remains unclear and weak relative to peers. We have always argued that Mario Greco should have raised capital right at the start,"" Mr. Seidl said. ####  ##### A source said the process to find a successor to Greco had started with the insurer looking inside and outside the group. ####  ##### Generali said its board would meet soon over the matter. #### "
"Zurich addresses losses, but planned changes may not be enough";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Zurich, United Kingdom";" ##### Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.'s nonlife underwriting results likely will remain under pressure as the insurer continues to make changes to address a string of recent losses, analysts say. ####  ##### Zurich last week announced that it expected to report a $100 million loss in its nonlife division for the fourth quarter of 2015. ####  ##### The insurer said that based on preliminary estimates, it expects to report losses of about $275 million from three storms that hit the United Kingdom and Ireland in December, as well as large losses from other natural catastrophe and accident-year claims. ####  ##### It said that its general insurance unit likely would report a $100 million loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 and said that it had accelerated a cost saving drive. ####  ##### In a briefing note on Monday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it expected Zurich's underwriting results to remain under pressure this year. ####  ##### “Zurich is also reducing expenses, but the benefits to net income will be offset by restructuring costs,” the New York-based rating agency said. ####  ##### Moody's said it expects Zurich to incur further restructuring charges in 2016. ####  ##### “These headwinds will come in addition to the low interest rates, which push investment income downwards and led Zurich to write off around $230 million of goodwill related to its German life business,” Moody's said. ####  ##### “The persistent occurrence of large losses that have affected Zurich's performance during the year continues to generate concerns about the extent of the problems underpinning the general insurance segment and the effectiveness of Zurich's underwriting risk management framework,” rating agency A.M. Best Co. Inc. said Monday in a briefing note. ####  ##### “Given the short term nature of the affected contracts, a material improvement in technical results is anticipated during 2016 and beyond, although A.M. Best recognises that remedial actions taken to restore profitability are expected to take time to materialize into a better quality insurance portfolio,” the Oldwick, New Jersey-based rating agency said. ####  ##### Recent changes to manage structure mean that there may be execution risk associated with the company's turnaround plans, Best added. ####  ##### Sami Taipalus, an analyst at Berenberg Bank A.G. in London, said Zurich's general insurance business likely will remain weak in 2016 and 2017. ####  ##### In a Thursday note to investors, Mr. Taipalus said given that many of the general insurance problems are related to “one-off events,” Zurich's management “appears to have concluded that the issues it faces can be managed through rate increases, selective re-underwriting and an acceleration of ongoing cost-cutting.” ####  ##### But he said Berenberg questions this approach for three reasons: “the persistence of recent adverse large loss experience implies issues with the group's underwriting protocol; reserve development has been choppy for some time, suggesting thin margins; and the 94% combined ratio reported for the bulk of general insurance at nine months benefitted materially from favorable natural catastrophe losses.” ####  ##### “These issues require more fundamental change than that planned for Zurich in 2016 and could even by aggravated by too aggressive cost-cutting,” he said. #### "

"New York governor nominates ex-staffer as top financial regulator";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers";" ##### (Reuters) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has tapped Maria Vullo, a New York lawyer and former staffer, as the state's top financial regulator, his office said Thursday. ####  ##### The nomination of Ms. Vullo as superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services comes more than eight months after the May 2015 departure of former superintendent Benjamin Lawsky. ####  ##### Ms. Vullo, a litigator from New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison L.L.P., also served as executive deputy attorney general for economic justice in 2010 under Gov. Cuomo, a Democrat, who was then New York state attorney general. ####  ##### Ms. Vullo could not immediately be reached for comment but issued a statement through Gov. Cuomo's office. ""I look forward to working with the talented men and women at DFS to strengthen our markets and protect investors and consumers from unlawful business practices,"" she said. ####  ##### Her nomination must be confirmed by the New York Legislature. ####  ##### The NYDFS has been in flux since Mr. Lawsky's departure, cycling through two acting superintendents. ####  ##### In October 2015, NYDFS Acting Superintendent Anthony Albanese resigned amid a dispute with Gov. Cuomo's administration, which had sought to approve any subpoenas the regulator intended to issue, according to media reports. ####  ##### Mr. Albanese remained with the agency until December 2015, when Shirin Emami, general counsel of NYDFS' banking division, became acting superintendent. ####  ##### Gov. Cuomo and New York's legislature created the NYDFS in 2011 by consolidating the state's banking and insurance agencies. The idea was to modernize regulation through a single agency that would oversee a broader array of financial products and services, the administration has said. ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky, the agency's first head, grabbed headlines in 2012 when he threatened to revoke Standard Chartered P.L.C.'s license to operate in New York after accusing the London-based bank of hiding $250 billion of Iran-linked transactions from regulators. ####  ##### Using a banking license as public leverage was an unusual move, creating an uproar that swept across the Atlantic and paving the way for a quick $340 million settlement between Standard Chartered and Mr. Lawsky. ####  ##### Other U.S. authorities, who were conducting a joint probe into Standard Chartered's sanctions-related violations, did not take kindly to Mr. Lawsky's going it alone. But the move drove home the agency's willingness to wield its power. ####  ##### Since then, the regulator has been widely perceived as an aggressive enforcer. It has made its mark in other landmark agreements with foreign banks over sanctions and tax-related violations, forcing resignations, record-breaking fines and other reforms. #### "

"HSBC to pay $470 million to resolve mortgage servicing probe";"Risk Management";"United Kingdom, D&O, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — HSBC Holdings P.L.C. will pay $470 million to settle parallel U.S. federal and state civil charges alleging the bank's mortgage servicing arm engaged in abusive foreclosure and loan origination practices, the New York attorney general's office said Friday. ####  ##### The mortgage settlement resolves claims brought against the London-based bank by the U.S. Justice Department, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and 49 states plus the District of Columbia. ####  ##### The New York attorney general's office said the HSBC accord largely mirrored a 2012 national mortgage settlement that federal and state officials struck with five of the country's largest banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ####  ##### The national mortgage settlement came in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 housing crisis, when many people lost their homes to foreclosure. ####  ##### The mortgage servicing investigation started after evidence emerged late in 2010 that banks had robo-signed thousands of foreclosure documents without properly reviewing paperwork. ####  ##### The HSBC agreement requires the company to provide various types of relief to mortgage holders, such as principal reductions and refinancing for underwater mortgages. ####  ##### Some borrowers who may have been harmed by the bank's mortgage servicing practices may also be eligible to receive payments through a national $59.3 million fund. ####  ##### HSBC also needs to undertake certain corrective actions. ####  ##### For instance, it must not foreclose on homeowners being considered for a loan modification and must give those people a chance to appeal denials. ####  ##### HSBC must also install an independent monitor to review compliance with the settlement, which will be entered into a federal court in Washington, D.C. ####  ##### ""There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes lenders who engage in abusive business practices,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. ####  ##### His office said New York had about 136,000 borrowers who may be eligible to reap the financial benefits from Friday's settlement. HSBC serviced the loans of these borrowers, who later lost their homes between 2008 and 2012. #### "
"Small captive owners face specific rules to prevent IRS scrutiny";"Risk Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, P/C Legislation & Regulation";" ##### BOCA RATON, Fla. — Legislation passed in 2015 that changed the requirements for how small captives are allowed to be structured will create lots of work for managers and lawyers into the next year, a captive expert predicts. ####  ##### The Protecting America From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, signed into law in December, changed section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code by increasing the maximum in premiums for small captive insurers to $2.2 million and adding a requirement to meet one of two diversification tests. All changes go into effect in 2017. ####  ##### The diversification tests came about after “voluminous captive audits,” were held and for the first time ever the IRS linked 831(b) captives with tax shelters, labeling captives as part of the “Dirty Dozen,” said David Snowball, Salt Lake City-based director of captive insurance for Utah, while speaking Tuesday at the 2016 World Captive Forum in Boca Raton, Florida. However, “just because the IRS is investigating doesn't mean anyone did anything wrong,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Snowball explained the diversification tests in examples of captive structures that would and would not meet one of the two tests. “The first diversification test is for when you have multiple insurers,” he said. “Not one of them can pay more than 20% of the premium from any one policy holder.” ####  ##### As an example, if a captive is structured where 12 corporations insured with a group captive that is owned by 12 unrelated people, each of them is going to pay 8.33% of the premium. This captive meets the diversity test and can elect section 831(b), he said. ####  ##### If one of the 12 people in the captive owned three corporations while the other 11 people in the captive each owned one corporation, then the one person owning three corporations would pay more than 20% of the premiums and the captive would not qualify to elect 831(b), he said. ####  ##### “Test 2 is for when related family members share ownership of the captive. Here, any one family member can't own more of the captive than they own in the operating company,” Mr. Snowball said. ####  ##### So if a father owned 70% of a business and 70% of a captive and the son owned 30% of that business and 30% of that captive, then the captive is eligible to make an election under section 831(b), he said. ####  ##### But if the son, instead of owning 30% of the captive owned 100%, then the captive is not eligible for the 831(b) election. ####  ##### Mr. Snowball estimates there are close to 5,000 small captives that can take advantage of the 831(b) election. They can also take advantage of the tax benefit and the insurance benefit of being a small captive, he said. ####  ##### “This has nothing to do with the definition of insurance; it only tells you who gets to be elected (for 831b), and if you do not, then you will be taxed under 831(a), which is how other insurance companies are taxed,” Mr. Snowball said. #### "

"Privacy vs. security at heart of Apple iPhone decrypt order";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, Regulation, Risk Management, Terrorism, Political Risk, Claims Disputes, Emerging Risks, General liability, Technology";" ##### (Reuters) — A court order demanding that Apple Inc. help the U.S. government unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is shaping up as a crucial test case of how far the government can go in forcing technology companies to help security and intelligence investigations. ####  ##### Law enforcement agencies have for years faced off against tech firms and privacy advocates over their ability to monitor digital communications, and the government to date has largely lost the battle. ####  ##### But the specific circumstances of the San Bernardino case, a young married couple who sympathized with Islamic State militants and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting rampage at a holiday party, could give government officials the legal precedent they need to reverse the tide. ####  ##### A federal judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide ""reasonable technical assistance"" to investigators seeking to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the shootings. ####  ##### The government argues that the iPhone is a crucial piece of evidence. But civil liberties groups warn that forcing companies to crack their own encryption endangers the technical integrity of the Internet and threatens not just the privacy of customers but potentially that of citizens of any country. ####  ##### On Wednesday, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates came out strongly on the side of law enforcement, raising the possibility of another legislative effort to require tech companies to put ""backdoors"" in their products. ####  ##### White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Department of Justice was asking Apple for access to just one device, a central part of the government's argument, which Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said was ""simply not true."" ####  ##### ""They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,"" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing. ####  ##### The Department of Justice stressed in a statement on Wednesday that its request was ""narrowly tailored,"" and chided Apple. ""It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil."" ####  ##### Most technology security experts, including many who have served in government, have said technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes. ####  ##### ""The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,"" Cook said in a statement on Tuesday. ""But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices."" ####  ##### Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai endorsed Cook's stance in tweets on Wednesday. ####  ##### ""We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders,"" he wrote. ""But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent."" ####  ##### Legal Fight ####  ##### Representatives of several tech companies did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling. Not surprisingly, however, trade groups that count thousands of software companies, smartphone makers and network security firms as members decried the government's position, while law enforcement groups backed the Justice Department. ####  ##### The industry was ""committed to working with law enforcement to keep Americans safe,"" the Software & Information Industry Association said, but in the Apple case, ""the government's position is overbroad and unwise."" ####  ##### The Computing Technology Industry Association said if the order was carried out, ""it could give the FBI the power to call for some sort of back end to encryption whenever they see fit."" ####  ##### If the federal judge, Magistrate Sheri Pym, rejects Apple's arguments, the Cupertino, California-based company can appeal her order to the district court, and then up the chain to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### The 9th Circuit is known to be pro-privacy. ""The government ultimately will have an uphill fight,"" said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises companies on cyber security issues. ####  ##### Farook was assigned the phone by the county health department for which he worked, prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday. The health department had ""given its consent"" to authorities to search the device and to Apple to assist investigators in that search, the document said. ####  ##### San Bernardino County's top prosecutor, District Attorney Mike Ramos, said Apple's refusal to unlock the phone was a slap in the face to the victims of the shooting and their families. ####  ##### ""They'd like to know details like any of us in America would like to know. Were there other threats? Were there other individuals involved?"" Ramos said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### 'Master Key' ####  ##### Dan Guido, an expert in hacking operating systems, said that to unlock the phone, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would need to install an update to Apple's iOS operating system so investigators could circumvent the security protections, including one that wipes data if an incorrect password is entered too many times. ####  ##### He said only Apple could provide that software because the phones will only install updates that are digitally signed with a secret cryptographic key. ####  ##### ""That key is one of the most valuable pieces of data the entire company owns,"" he said. ""Someone with that key can change all the data on all the iPhones."" ####  ##### The notion of providing that key is anathema to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online rights group. ""Once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well,"" the foundation said in a statement. ####  ##### Lance James, an expert in forensics who is chief scientist with cyber intelligence company Flashpoint, said Apple could respond to the order without providing crypto keys or specialized tools that could be used to unlock other phones. ####  ##### Apple technicians could create software that would unlock the phone, allowing the company to create a backup file with all of its contents that they could provide to law enforcement, James said. ####  ##### American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Alex Abdo said the government's request risked a ""dangerous"" precedent.

"Hospital pays ransom in bitcoins to restore computer systems";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, Technology";" ##### A Los Angeles hospital has agreed to pay the equivalent of $17,000 in bitcoins to restore control of its computer systems, in a “ransomware” incident. ####  ##### Allen Stefanek, president and CEO of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a private 434-bed facility, said in a statement Wednesday that on Feb. 5, the hospital staff noticed problems accessing the hospital's computer network, and an investigation by its information technology department determined it had been subject to a malware attack. ####  ##### “The malware locked access to certain computer systems and prevented us from sharing communications electronically,” said the statement. ####  ##### According to news reports, doctors at the hospital were forced to rely on telephones and fax machines to relay patient information, and communications between physicians and staff were bogged down by paper records and difficulty deciphering doctors' handwriting. There were also reports that ambulances had been diverted from the hospital. ####  ##### The hospital received a ransom demand of 40 bitcoins, which is the equivalent of about $17,000, to obtain the decryption key to unlock the system, and paid it. ####  ##### “The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. In the best interest of restoring normal operations we did this,” said Mr. Stefanek's statement. ####  ##### He said the hospital has restored its electronic medical record system as of Monday. “All clinical operations are utilizing the (electronic medical record) system,” said the statement. “All systems currently in use were cleared of the malware and thoroughly tested. We continue to work with our team of experts to understand more about this event.” ####  ##### The statement said also: “Patient care has not been compromised in any way. Further, we have no evidence at this time that any patient or employee information was subject to unauthorized access.” ####  ##### A hospital spokeswoman had no further comment. ####  ##### In October, Cisco Systems Inc. said it had managed to disrupt the spread of one of the most pernicious systems for infecting Internet users with malicious software such as ransomware. ####  ##### A Singapore-based chief security officer for Microsoft Asia, a unit of Microsoft Corp., predicted in December 2014 that while at that point ransomware had largely been confined to Australia, it would appear elsewhere as well. #### "
"Aon alleges construction group poaching by Alliant ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Aon, Construction, General liability";" ##### A federal judge in Chicago has issued a temporary restraining order forbidding Alliant Insurance Services Inc. from soliciting Aon construction services group employees and clients. ####  ##### The ruling is the latest in disputes between Aon and Alliant about alleged poaching. ####  ##### In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Aon alleged that former executive Michael Heffernan resigned abruptly from Aon; immediately joined Newport Beach, California-based Alliant; and that he helped hire away 26 of the 31 employees at Aon's San Jose, California, office. ####  ##### Alliant announced earlier this month that Mr. Heffernan  had joined it as vice president of its construction services group in San Jose. ####  ##### In her Feb. 10 ruling in Aon P.L.C. v. Michael Heffernan et al., U.S. District Court Judge Andrea R. Wood approved the temporary restraining order, saying Aon had “demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, starting with the choice of which state's law should apply.” ####  ##### Although Alliant argued the case should be heard in California, “plaintiffs have presented a sufficient legal and factual argument in favor of Illinois law to support the likelihood of success on the merits of their claims,” Judge Wood ruled. ####  ##### The order states also that Aon has presented evidence that it maintains a proprietary database of customer information,and that while Mr. Heffernan did not typically use it, “he accessed it for an extended period” when he began to discuss future employment with Alliant. ####  ##### Aon's suit accuses Mr. Heffernan of breach of noncompete agreements and breach of his fiduciary duties. Aside from barring Alliant from soliciting any employee or client of Aon's, the judge also ordered Mr. Heffernan and others not to disclose any of Aon's information and return information from its proprietary database to Aon. ####  ##### An Alliant spokesman could not be reached for comment. ####  ##### A status hearing has been set for Feb. 22 in the case. ####  ##### In another  poaching dispute between Aon and Alliant, a New York appellate court in 2013  forbade Alliant Senior Managing Director Peter Arkley, formerly CEO of Aon's construction operations, from soliciting business from any former Aon client for the two years prior to June 13, 2011. #### "

L.L.C. effective this May, while his brother David, formerly an executive vice president, left Willis Re in August 2015. ####  ##### In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Willis Towers Watson accuses the Hearns of breach of contract, unjust enrichment and conversion for retention awards they were given during their time with Willis Re. ####  ##### Willis alleges that, according to their respective employment contracts that paid Peter Hearn an award of  $1.75 million each year in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and David Hearn $525,000 to $675,000 a year during that period, they agreed to repay the performance awards should they leave Willis before the end of their contracts. ####  ##### Willis Towers Watson alleges the men have thus far refused to repay their portions of the awards. ####  ##### “Willis Towers Watson is currently pursuing legal redress for breach of contract. We will always defend our rights robustly and will pursue cases vigorously where we believe action is necessary to vindicate the company's rights,” a Willis Towers Watson spokeswoman said Tuesday in an email to Business Insurance. ####  ##### Willis Towers Watson is seeking approximately $2.8 million in damages from Peter Hearn and approximately $800,000 from David Hearn. ####  ##### Guy Carpenter, a Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. subsidiary, declined comment on the case. #### "
"Feds try to clarify joint employer status";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, General liability";" ##### The Department of Labor's wage and hour division and the National Labor Relations Board have weighed in on the issue of joint employment and employers' potential liability under federal law. ####  ##### The Labor Department's Jan. 20 guidance, “Joint Employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act and Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act,” says that joint employment can be either “horizontal” or “vertical.” ####  ##### Horizontal employment “should be considered when an employee is employed by two (or more) technically separate but related or overlapping employers,” such as separate restaurants that share economic ties, says the guidance. ####  ##### Vertical joint employment situations happen when the “employee of the intermediary employer is also employed by another employer,” which would include staffing agencies, for instance. ####  ##### Determining whether an employee has more than one employer is important in determining employer rights and obligations under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the agricultural worker act, says the guidance. ####  ##### Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board last year held in Browning-Ferris of California Inc. that a company need have only indirect control of a worker and does not need to exercise that control to be considered a joint employer. ####  ##### The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also made rulings on the issue. ####  ##### For instance, in EEOC v. Skanska USA Building Inc., which later was settled in January 2015 for $95,000, the agency successfully argued before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati that the joint employer concept could be applied to New York-based Skanska in a case involving a subcontractor. #### "
"Underwriters get ready for crewless ships";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Marine";" ##### Autonomous ships are being explored by the cargo industry, giving marine insurers about five years to determine the costs of covering a crewless ship for risks that can occur at sea. ####  ##### And the lack of historical data typical of any new technology is complicating the process of underwriting the risks of unmanned ships. ####  ##### “As insurers, we need to get data,” said Andrew Kinsey, a former ship's captain and now a New York-based senior marine consultant at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty S.E. ####  ##### “We need a method to safely and effectively implement unmanned vessels and get the data we need,” Mr. Kinsey said. He suggested a convoy scenario, where several unmanned vessels would be chaperoned by a manned vessel, “riding herd, like a sheepdog,” he said. ####  ##### An autonomous vessel would be best suited to replace dry-bulk carriers that operate in intercontinental trade, according to three-year research project Maritime Unmanned Navigation through Intelligence Networks, as these ships travel slowly, transporting cargo such as timber or steel in long, uninterrupted ocean voyages. ####  ##### “The insurance industry has been at the forefront of most pioneering projects now covering drones, satellite launches, satellites in orbit, test flights, remotely controlled underwater vehicles and a number of other automated products,” Sean Woollerson, London-based senior partner at JLT Specialty Ltd., said in an email. “But a vessel being operated remotely from onshore will bring unique challenges in the developing of a fully automated complex key component for the supply chain.” ####  ##### Those challenges include pirates, a fire at sea and the time involved to reach the ship if a computer malfunctions. ####  ##### Alan Jervis, founder of Marine, Transportation and Energy Insurance Experts, a consultant to the worldwide insurance, risk management, shipping and transportation industries based in Toronto, points out that a ship is different than other vehicles that may operate autonomously. For one, a cargo ship will be isolated on the ocean. “One of the duties of the crew is to ensure the cargo is inspected, that it doesn't leak or break through and cause a fire,” Mr. Jervis said. ####  ##### Shipping services provider Clarkson P.L.C. puts the number of cargo ships operating now at 9,600. Though none are unmanned, crewless smaller vessels are expected to be in use in three to five years, with larger merchant ships, those carrying oil and heavier cargo, arriving in 10 to 15 years, according to the Royal Institute of Naval Architects, a London-based professional organization whose members work in the design, construction, maintenance and operation of marine vessels and structures. ####  ##### Europe is prime territory for their use, facing issues such as increased cargo volume and environmental requirements and a decline in the number of sailors. So the Europe Commission funded the three-year MUNIN research project to investigate the possibilities of unmanned ships. ####  ##### MUNIN, completed in August 2015, used 10 years of global manned ship data to compare risks of manned ships to those of unmanned ships and projected that an unmanned ship would have one-tenth of the risk of a manned ship in foundering and collision, in which human error often plays a role. The analysis also predicted a savings of $7 million over a 25-year period per ship in fuel use and crew supplies and salaries. ####  ##### “This is less about pros and cons of a crew and more about how insurers can analyze risk,” Tom Hoad, London-based head of innovation at Tokio Marine Kiln Group Ltd., said in an email. ####  ##### “Undoubtedly one of the benefits is that better informatics means that insurers might be in a better position to calculate risk,” Mr. Hoad said of the advanced modeling tools risk managers use to determine risk. “Perhaps one of the downsides, though, is the question of what new risk emerges from not having a crew.” ####  ##### To Mr. Jervis, liability and a credible backup plan if something goes wrong at sea would be paramount to cover the millions of dollars of cargo generally on ships. “There wouldn't be anyone there if there was a breakdown of the computer systems,” Mr. Jervis said. “You could have a train break down in the city of Chicago and a crew could come in minutes, but the Atlantic can be a one-week voyage and the Pacific two to three weeks.” ####  ##### When it comes to drone technology in any line of transportation, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. “Insurers have to look at every risk on a case-by-case basis and decide what the individual threats are,” Mr. Hoad said. ####  ##### Typically insurers calculate risk by comparing the known volatility of a similar class to the new one, he said. For example, light aircraft gave the industry more data about unmanned aerial vehicles. ####  ##### But vessels have unique risks, such as pirates. Although the Royal Institute of Naval Architects considers pirates to be “virtually a nonissue for fully unmanned ships,” it cites the lack of crew to take hostage and the ease of creating control systems that cannot be operated by nonauthorized personnel. “Pirates would need an ocean-going tug to steal the ship or cargo,” the organization said in a January statement. ####  ##### With 23 years in the Merchant Marines, including 13 as captain of five vessels, Mr. Kinsey disputes that, saying an unmanned vessel at sea would be at higher risk of piracy. ####  ##### Speaking from experience with pirates, he said: “I believe that a human presence on board with active piracy measures in place is an effective deterrent to a pirate boarding.” #### "
"Risk managers missing out on big data opportunities";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Technology, Risk Management Insurance Panel";" ##### The market may still not be ready for all the sophisticated functionalities that technology companies have to offer risk managers, a Business Insurance survey concludes. ####  ##### According to Business Insurance's Risk Management Insights Panel, which comprises risk managers in industries that include construction, transportation, real estate and health care, 97% are the final decision-makers or actively participate in their organization's insurance purchases. ####  ##### The online survey, which drew 184 responses, found that 65% of respondents are light to moderate users of risk management information systems. Twenty-eight percent say they do not use RMIS at their company at all. ####  ##### Risk management professionals also are not jumping on the big data bandwagon, as only 5% of survey respondents said they currently use big data in their modeling efforts. ####  ##### About one-fifth of the total still rely on spreadsheets. ####  ##### Amid cyber breaches, geopolitical problems around the world and financial market turmoil, 69% do feel that risk management today is a higher priority in their organization than it was two years ago. ####  ##### The top five risks about which their organizations are most concerned are operational, regulatory, legal, data/cyber and reputational risks, according to the survey. ####  ##### For the 72% of risk managers that do have RMIS, managing and monitoring workers compensation claims is the top thing that today's technology allows that was not available in the past. ####  ##### Managing risk and insurance, producing detailed internal reports, capturing and analyzing risk data and improving risk analysis round out the top five uses of RMIS by today's risk managers. That is nearly the same as Business Insurance's previous risk manager survey in 2014. ####  ##### But when it comes to challenges the risk managers expect to face in the next 12 to 24 months, collecting and analyzing data is not the biggest issue. ####  ##### Members of the Risk Management Insights Panel say their three biggest concerns in the next two years are getting business units to collaborate on risk management initiatives, developing a risk culture within the organization and aligning their tolerance of risk with the company's overall business strategy. ####  ##### Improving risk measurement, forecasting and modeling is No. 4 among their future concerns, while No. 5 is making risk management a key priority for executive leadership. ####  ##### As far as RMIS and other technology, risk managers' top desire is that it be able to forecast risks, followed by relating risks and processes, conducting risk and other business analysis, quantifying risks and risk assessments. ####  ##### That means risk technology companies may want to increase the sophistication and functionality of their offerings, but also put equal emphasis on making their systems easier to use, considering the time lag in risk management's adoption of new technology. ####  ##### That could help with companies' generally flat spending on new tech tools. ####  ##### Sixty-five percent of the respondents said there has been no increase in technology investment in the past year. Still, the 33% that did increase technology spending in the past year said it increased by 10% to more than 50%. ####  ##### The average spending on new technology in the past year was $129,000, but 70% said their company spent less than $100,000 on risk management software. ####  ##### No one RMIS provider dominates the market. ####  ##### One-third of the risk managers said they did not receive any training when new technology was adopted, but the survey was of senior executives with an average age of 53.2, who may not use the technology every day. ####  ##### The Jan. 12-27 survey has a 95% confidence level. #### "
"Preparing for the inevitable";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Technology";" ##### Difficulty in forecasting rapidly changing risks, notably cyber liability and reputation risk, are driving risk managers to seek more from their risk management information systems. ####  ##### RMIS once focused on basic tasks such as claims and insurance policy management. Observers say today's risk managers want to increase their predictive analytic capabilities, but also worry about the accuracy of such forecasts. ####  ##### “There are basically two schools of thought within the risk management community,” said John Phelps, director of business risk solutions at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida in Jacksonville and a past president of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. ####  ##### One consists of traditional risk managers who are looking for claims management capabilities, policy management and archiving abilities, he said. The other school of thought involves risk managers who focus primarily on enterprise risk management and are not involved in risk financing, he said. ####  ##### “Predictive analytics is by far the hottest topic” in RMIS today, said Paul Marushka, president of Chicago-based Marsh ClearSight L.L.C., previously CS Stars L.L.C. until it was rebranded last year. “The research we've seen is that 66% of the risk managers say they do not have the analytics they need to manage their risk effectively, and 86% say their ability to forecast risks will become more difficult in the next three years.” ####  ##### Mr. Marushka said risks continue to evolve and are getting harder to identify, citing cyber risk as an example. ####  ##### “It takes over 80 weeks for shareholder value to recover after a reputational crisis,” Mr. Marushka said. “The ability of risk managers to model that out so they can give a perspective holistically across their organizations is a top priority.” ####  ##### “We see an acceleration, with risk managers talking about uninsurable risks,” said Bob Morrell, CEO of Kennesaw, Georgia-based Riskonnect Inc. ####  ##### “The nature of risk management is evolving dramatically, from a relatively steady state to more of a rapid-response environment,” said Stephen Rhee, Chicago-based CEO of Ventiv Technology Inc. He said that risk managers must be prepared to deal with developments that can arise at any moment. ####  ##### “Cyber risk is different than just about any other class of risk facing a business today, in that there is somebody actively trying to do harm to your organization every day,” he said. “For every organization, it's not a matter of if, but when, in terms of when it will face a cyber attack.” ####  ##### Mr. Rhee said an RMIS system is “critical to help risk managers prepare for and deal with this inevitability.” ####  ##### According to Mr. Rhee, the effective quantification of risk exposures, both tangible and intangible, is probably the most difficult component of cyber risk assessment. “Use of a RMIS system in the quantification helps standardize both definition and values of all classes of exposed assets,” he said. ####  ##### According to Ventiv, other risks that could require a rapid response include weather impact, product failure and brand reputation. ####  ##### “We've tailored offerings that are specific around cyber risks, but also handle the broadest impact of what those risks entail,” said Riskonnect's Mr. Morrell. ####  ##### “When you look at what RMIS has done, it's been a matter of let's help the risk management department make better decisions,” Mr. Morrell said. “That's important, but there's a lot more to risk management than that. The complexity of the uninsurable side of risk just keeps increasing. If you use a spreadsheet to manage it, it just falls apart.” ####  ##### Rather than subscribing to one benchmark model or one built-in predictive model, risk managers “are coming to the same conclusion that insurance underwriters have subscribed to for many years: overlaying multiple data points drives better results,” said Aaron Shapiro, New York-based executive vice president of Chicago-based Origami Risk L.L.C. ####  ##### He said that on its own, each of these analytics is somewhere between a compass and a GPS. ####  ##### RMIS “won't tell you to … settle your claim for exactly $20,000',” he said, but “they will give you something better than, 'Head northwest,'” Mr. Shapiro said. ####  ##### “Our clients are now looking to subscribe to multiple sources and overlay the analytics and their own private data” such as claims, policies, exposures and the like, he said. ####  ##### “They can expect to see RMIS offer more and more flexible tools to automatically combine these data sets. The result will be more informed decisions and the ability to drive the best results via rules-based automation,” Mr. Shapiro said. ####  ##### “What do I see the rising risk professionals doing? They're using apps for everything” on their smartphones, said Darius Delon, chair of the RIMS Canada Council and associate vice president of risk management at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta. ####  ##### “The integration of a worthwhile app that's on your phone that allows your common staff members that have the app to actually record the incident” would be a welcome addition to RMIS, he said. For a university, an incident could range from water damage to property to a campus commotion, he said. “We have some stuff that's cloud-based, but you have to log into the system … you're already away from the incident. It would have to be so simple that everybody could do it.” ####  ##### “If you don't capture the incident, you don't manage the claim” that arises from it, Mr. Delon said. #### "

"AIG faces up to past losses, future challenges as break-up pressure mounts";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, AIG, Financial Results";" ##### Poor commercial property/casualty insurance results helped push American International Group Inc. to a net loss of $1.84 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015 from a net gain of $655 million during the same period a year earlier, the New York-based insurer said Thursday. ####  ##### At the same time, AIG conceded to pressure from activist shareholder Carl Icahn and added board seats for his allies. ####  ##### “Commercial Insurance reported a pre-tax operating loss of $2.1 billion compared to pre-tax operating income of $1.2 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by the previously announced $3.0 billion charge for adverse prior year loss reserve development in property casualty and lower net investment income in property casualty and institutional markets,” said an AIG statement announcing its results. Catastrophe-related losses also jumped to $213 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million during the corresponding period in 2014. ####  ##### Commercial insurance's combined ratio in the fourth quarter deteriorated to 161.5% from 103.4% posted during the fourth quarter of 2014. Net written commercial insurance premiums declined 1.9% to $4.60 billion. ####  ##### For 2015 as a whole, net income dropped 70.8% to $2.20 billion. Net written commercial premiums dropped 2.8% to $20.44 million and the combined ratio deteriorated to 115.0% from 100.2%. ####  ##### The results came as AIG has faced pressure from investor Carl Icahn and others to split into three companies — life, property/casualty and mortgage insurance — to increase shareholder value and to get AIG off the list of systemically important financial institutions. AIG is one of three insurers — MetLife Inc. and Prudential Insurance Co. being the others — designated as SIFIs and thus subject to increased federal oversight. MetLife is currently challenging the designation in court, where proceedings began this week. ####  ##### AIG announced recently that it would put up to 19.9% of its mortgage insurance business on the market in an initial public offering later this year, with an eye to selling off the entire business. ####  ##### Along with its earnings announcement, AIG said Thursday that it was expanding its board of directors to 16 members from 14. The two new members it will nominate are John Paulson, president of Paulson & Co., and Samuel Merksamer, a managing director of Icahn Capital L.P. ####  ##### Mr. Icahn posted a statement on his website noting the agreement with AIG under which the two new board members would be nominated, adding that he declined to go on the board because of his “involvement with so many other companies at this time.” ####  ##### “We welcome John Paulson's addition to the board and believe his involvement will be additive, especially in that we both have stated the same goals for AIG,” Mr. Icahn wrote. “We commend the board for adopting a number of our recommendations over the last few months. We continue to believe that smaller and simpler is better and look forward to working collaboratively with the board and management to help catalyze a turnaround in core (property/casualty) operations, a more transparent operating structure, and the ultimate shedding of the SIFI designation. We believe that AIG stockholders will benefit from our agreement.” ####  ##### During an earnings call Friday, AIG President and CEO Peter Hancock said he was “pleased we have reached a solution” that avoids a “distracting” proxy fight at the AIG's annual meeting later this year. ####  ##### He said that AIG has already taken steps to become a more “streamlined” company. These included a reduction in the ranks of senior management by more than 20% announced late last year and the announced sale of part of its stake in Chinese insurer PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd. Last month, AIG also announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its broker-dealer AIG Advisor Group for an undisclosed sum. ####  ##### “We stand by our plan” to cut costs and to improve the company's performance, said Mr. Hancock Friday. ####  ##### “The company's operational plan is a move in the right direction — and looks to us much like they are re-focusing on 'shrinking to greatness' in property/casualty,” said Josh Stirling, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. L.L.C. in New York in a note. “Though we have been more a critic of management than most, after two years in the wilderness, management's recent plan addresses many of our concerns.” ####  ##### Mr. Stirling also viewed the addition of the new board members as a positive step. ####  ##### “Adding activists to the board will — at a minimum — ensure leadership's focus and commitment on shareholder value, and provide continued pressure to deliver,” he wrote. “But more importantly, letting the activists behind the curtain will allow them to engage with the full board — and a full set of nonpublic financials — to both challenge management's plan, as well as explore other strategic alternatives — like more aggressively selling assets, and pursuing an explicit plan to de-SIFI.” #### "
"Retaliation tops EEOC discrimination charges in fiscal 2015";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Retaliation continued to be the most frequently filed charge of discrimination at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accounting for 44.5% of private-sector charges filed in fiscal year 2015, the agency said Thursday. ####  ##### There were 39,757 retaliation charges filed, out of a total of 89,385 received by the EEOC, a 4.7% increase over the 37,955 reported for fiscal year 2014, when retaliation was also the No. 1 charge and accounted for 42.8% of all charges, the agency said in a statement. The EEOC's fiscal year ends Sept. 30. ####  ##### The EEOC is now seeking public input on proposed enforcement guidance on retaliation and related issues in an effort to update guidance last issued in 1998, the agency said last month. ####  ##### The second-most frequent discrimination charge was race, which accounted for 31,027 charges, or 34.7% of the total.

"Privatizing flood insurance a 'priority' for House finance committee ";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, P/C Insurers, Regulation, Risk Management";" ##### WASHINGTON — Consideration of a bill that would encourage private insurers to enter the flood insurance market is a “priority” for the House Financial Services Committee, the chairman of the panel said Wednesday. ####  ##### Speaking to the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers’ annual legislative summit on Capitol Hill, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said that there is so little private involvement in the flood insurance market that “anything we can do” is a step in the right direction. ####  ##### Most flood insurance in the United States is written under the National Flood Insurance Program, which is about $25 billion in debt, Rep. Hensarling said. ####  ##### He said the committee’s consideration of the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act — H.R. 2901 — is a priority for his panel. The measure would give states the right to regulate private flood insurers in an effort to encourage the development of a private flood insurance market and lessen dependence on the NFIP. ####  ##### “I’ll do everything I can do to open up the program,” Rep. Hensarling said, adding there are “huge segments” of the flood insurance market that could be opened up to the private market. ####  ##### Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his own remarks to summit attendees, called cyber threats “the white elephant in the room.” He said that the Obama administration has no policy to prevent cyber attacks such as the one on the Office of Personnel Management in June 2015, that compromised personal information on millions of people. “There will be more” attacks, he said. Sen. McCain said that the Russians are the best at carrying out cyber attacks against U.S. interests, with the Chinese ranking second. ####  ##### The summit drew about 150 attendees, which set a record. #### "

Underwriting profit for the other primary insurer group increased 31.6% to $824 million compared with a year earlier. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway said in its annual report that the results reflect rising claim costs at GEICO and lower earnings from reinsurers, which were partially offset by increased earnings from other primary insurance operations. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway's overall net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31.8% to $5.48 billion, bolstered by improved results in its railroad business. For the year as a whole, Berkshire Hathaway's net income increased 21.2% to $24.08 billion. ####  ##### Managing Director Meyer Shields and Assistant Vice President Christopher Campbell at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in Baltimore said in a report they anticipate that Gen Re and Berkshire Hathaway's premium volumes and margins “to generally decline in 2016 and beyond, reflecting enduring reinsurance price competition and some fallout from Berkshire's increasing pursuit of primary premium volume at the likely expense of some former cedents.” ####  ##### Results for the primary group, said the analysts, “reflected strong, but slowing growth within Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance,” which is attributable to “the persistently favorable claims environment. ####  ##### “Sustained impressive underwriting profitability despite (the business') presumed rapid growth is unusual and suggests to us that Berkshire is winning unusually profitable business,” Messrs. Shields and Campbell said in the analysis. ####  ##### The report said also Berkshire Hathaway Specialty, which has hit $1 billion in annual premiums, “has created something of a virtuous cycle for itself. We attribute a lot of its success to particularly profitable business won from (New York-based American International Group Inc.). ####  ##### “As much of (the unit's) senior management came from AIG, a lot of AIG's remaining commercial business is unprofitable, and its withdrawal from particularly unprofitable products should provide more opportunities for (the unit) to sift through (likely at higher, or much higher, rates.)” said the report. ####  ##### Cliff Gallant, an analyst at Nomura Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said in an investor note that reinsurance pricing “remains under pressure, particularly in the property catastrophe lines, and the company continues to withdraw capacity as reflected in declining premium volume. ####  ##### “In a period of low loss activity, however, underwriting results were strong, with Gen Re reporting an 87.6% combined ratio and (Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group) reported a 90.8%,” Mr. Gallant said. #### "
"Catastrophe bonds attract investors despite concerns over lack of information";"Risk Management";"Insurance-linked Securities";" ##### NEW YORK — Investors and advisers expressed optimism for continued growth and support of the insurance-linked securities market even as they discussed the need for greater transparency and disclosure. ####  ##### “We should all be optimistic about prospects for the coming year,” said Bill Dubinsky, head of insurance linked securities for Willis Capital Markets & Advisory in New York. ####  ##### One advantage insurance-linked securities offer institutional investors is that such securities are not correlated with the broader equity and debt markets and thus offer investment diversification. ####  ##### “For most investors, they are really attracted to the asset class for the diversification benefit,” said Todor Todorov, senior investment consultant — hedge fund research, for Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. in New York. ####  ##### “I think it surprised people in terms of its uncorrelated nature, again, especially the new investors,” said Jonathan Malawer, managing director and senior investment analyst for K2 Advisors L.L.C. in New York, adding that 2015 was “such a challenging period for financial markets.” ####  ##### “Investors continue to grow assets under management notwithstanding the softer market,” said Mr. Dubinsky on the sidelines of the 16th annual Insurance & Risk-Linked Securities Conference sponsored by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association last week in New York, where Mr. Dubinsky was co-chairman of this year’s conference. ####  ##### “Total nonlife ILS capital reached $70 billion at year-end 2015, and net new capital continues to flow into the space,” said Mr. Dubinsky. ####  ##### Mr. Malawer said he believes the ILS market has staying power. “I think investors are in it for the long-term for sure,” he said. ####  ##### “We came to this market with a long-term view,” said Dan Bergman, head of investment research and insurance-linked securities, Third Swedish National Pension Fund, Stockholm, Sweden. ####  ##### Diversification was part of the draw, he said. ####  ##### “We came to this market for diversification,” said Mr. Bergman, adding “but not only for that,” emphasizing that returns were equally as important and portfolios are adjusted as such. ####  ##### “We’ve now worked in this market space for 10 years, and we don’t plan on leaving, but we do move allocations up and down,” said Mr. Bergman. ####  ##### As the market grows and expands, it encounters new demands and challenges, high among them concerns over disclosures of losses to catastrophe bonds. ####  ##### “As the 144A market has expanded with many more catastrophe bonds with indemnity triggers, there’s been a greater need for real-time disclosure to investors with regard to losses,” said Michael Groll, a partner in the corporate insurance and regulatory group of Willkie Farr & Gallagher L.L.P. in New York, referring to one leading ILS format under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. ####  ##### His views were echoed by John DeCaro, founding principal and portfolio manager with Elementum Advisors L.L.C. in Chicago. ####  ##### “As an investor, we are desirous of as much information as possible,” said Mr. DeCaro. ####  ##### There was confidence, however, that this would happen. ####  ##### “Our view is that over time disclosures will increase,” said Ben Rubin, executive vice president, capital markets for Axis Re U.S. in New York. ####  ##### Although catastrophe bond issuance declined to $6.9 billion in 2015 from $8.0 billion in 2014, the sector is still showing promising signs of growth, according to insurance industry reports. ####  ##### Both Aon Benfield Securities and Swiss Re Ltd. say in reports issued Jan. 21 and Jan. 22, respectively, that 2016 catastrophe bond issuance could reach $7 billion. ####  ##### Meanwhile, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory, a Willis Towers Watson unit, notes in a report issued Jan. 19 that the 2014 total was bolstered by the largest single catastrophe bond ever issued, the $1.5 billion Everglades Re Ltd. from Citizens Property Insurance Corp., a bond providing coverage for Florida windstorms that was upsized more than once due to strong demand. ####  ##### “Looking at the headline catastrophe bond figure, a decline in issuance appears to be the case. However, this general picture fails to account for the huge $1.5 billion transaction completed in 2014 — Citizens’ Everglades Re — which skews any prior-year comparison,” said Mr. Dubinsky in a statement accompanying the Willis report. ####  ##### The Aon report, “Insurance-Linked Securities Year-End 2015 Update,” also noted that 2015 saw a record level of catastrophe bond maturities at $6.8 billion. ####  ##### The Swiss Re report, “Insurance Linked Securities Market Update, Volume XXIV, January 2016,” notes that this trend will continue with close to $4 billion worth of scheduled maturities in the first half of 2016. ####  ##### Growth in the ILS sector in 2015 could also be seen by an important expansion in geography and covered perils as the first catastrophe bond was launched in China. ####  ##### The third quarter saw four transactions including Panda Re Ltd., the first China-exposed catastrophe bond, which provides $50 million of earthquake coverage for China Property and Casualty Reinsurance Co. ####  ##### The fourth quarter saw six transactions including Kilimanjaro Re Ltd. which provided a total of $625 million of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico hurricane and earthquake coverage for Everest Reinsurance Co. #### "
"FAA starts rule-making process for public drone flights";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management, Regulation, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Technology, Aviation";" ##### (Reuters) — The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday said it would develop drone regulations allowing some unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to fly over people, an authorization eagerly sought by a range of industries including real estate and agriculture. ####  ##### The U.S. aviation regulatory agency, under pressure from Congress and industry to accommodate commercial drones, said it established a rule-making committee that would recommend a new regulatory framework by April 1. ####  ##### Authorization to fly over people would be vital to the kind of package delivery services envisioned by Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. But the new committee will focus on smaller UAVs that are used for aerial photography in real estate, agriculture and surveying. ####  ##### The drones to be examined would include micro UAVs that weigh no more than 4.4 pounds (2 kg). But larger ones could also be included if their design, shape or slow speed posed little or no risk to people on the ground or to manned aircraft, the FAA said. ####  ##### Commercial drone operations are illegal in the United States without specific FAA permission. The agency is expected to release final regulations by late June that would allow flights by commercial drones weighing up to 55 pounds (24.95 kg). ####  ##### An FAA spokeswoman said the new committee's work was part of a separate effort. ####  ##### ""We recognize the significant industry interest in expanding commercial access to the National Airspace System. The short deadline reinforces our commitment to a flexible regulatory approach,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. ####  ##### Lobbyists predicted the process would take years to produce an actual rule. ####  ##### The announcement came as lawmakers in Congress consider legislation that would greatly reduce restrictions on micro drones. A six-year FAA reauthorization bill, which could be weeks away from a vote in the House of Representatives, would exempt small drones from requirements including the need for an operator to acquire a pilot's license. ####  ##### The FAA said the committee will develop recommendations for performance-based standards for drones that can be operated safely over people and determine how drone makers can comply with the requirements. ####  ##### The agency will draft a rule-making proposal after reviewing the committee's report. #### "
"RSA Insurance ramps up cost-cutting, return targets as 2015 profit soars";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Zurich, United Kingdom, Financial Results";" ##### (Reuters) — British insurer RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. on Thursday ratcheted up its return targets and cost-cutting plans following an abandoned takeover bid last year from Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. as it reported a 43% rise in operating profit for 2015. ####  ##### Shares in the company, best known in Britain for its More Than brand, soared more than 7%, leading the FTSE 100 index higher. ####  ##### Stephen Hester, brought in from Royal Bank of Scotland P.L.C. to turn the company around two years ago, previously called the aborted £5.6 billion ($8.07 billion) takeover attempt by Zurich a distraction. ####  ##### Mr. Hester told a media call the group had received no other approaches after the Zurich bid fell away, and would have to rely on self-help for growth. ####  ##### ""It's a tough and competitive environment, interest rates won't give us any help,"" Mr. Hester said. ""We had a bit of a dance with Zurich in the summer. Relative to six months ago, (RSA) is stronger and better."" ####  ##### RSA said it was targeting the upper half of its medium-term performance goal of 12% to 15% underlying return on tangible equity by 2017, ""with further improvement to come thereafter."" ####  ##### It said it expected to make cost savings of £250 million ($360.1 million) by 2016, a year ahead of schedule, and was targeting more than £350 million ($504.2 million) in gross annualized savings by 2018. ####  ##### Operating profit of £523 million ($753.4 million) was well above analysts' consensus of £481 million ($692.9 million) in a company-supplied forecast. ####  ##### RSA had a combined ratio of 96.0%, against a forecast 97.1%, despite floods in Britain in December that cost it £76 million ($109.5 million) in losses. A ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit. ####  ##### The firm published a solvency capital ratio of 143% under new European Solvency II capital rules prior to the completion of the sale of its Latin American business, and set a target ratio of 130% to 160%. ####  ##### A solvency ratio of 100% means an insurer has set aside enough capital to meet underwriting, investment and operational risks. #### "

"EEOC proposes federal agency employment targets for the disabled ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, Disability";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking Tuesday that reaffirms the government's commitment to achieve a 12% representation employment rate for individuals with disabilities, and a 2% representation rate for individuals with “targeted/severe” disabilities for its employees. ####  ##### The proposed rule, which will be officially published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, does not affect private employers, the EEOC said. Members of the public have until April 25 to comment on the proposal. ####  ##### In addition to setting the numerical goals, and requiring enhanced efforts to hire individuals with disabilities, the proposed rule would require agencies to provide “personal assistance services” to employees who, because of their disability, require help with services such as eating and using the restroom while at work, the agency said. ####  ##### Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires federal agencies to create affirmative action plans for the employment of people with disabilities and to submit those plans to the EEOC, the agency said. ####  ##### “Although federal agencies have improved their efforts to hire and retain individuals with disabilities, they remain underrepresented in the federal workforce,” says the EEOC in a background information on the rulemaking. ####  ##### “The federal government has a special responsibility to lead by example in serving as a model employer for people with disabilities in the workforce,” said EEOC Chair Jenny Yang in the statement. “This proposal offers concrete steps and accountability mechanisms to promote employment and advancement opportunities for people with disabilities, including individuals with targeted or severe disabilities.” ####  ##### In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20130828/NEWS07/130829816 finalized a proposed rule under which federal contractors and subcontractors would be required to set a hiring goal of having 7% of their workforce in each job group be people with disabilities. #### "
"Restaurant to pay $450,000 in sexual harassment case";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A Lexington, Kentucky-based restaurant franchisee has agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in connection with alleged sexual harassment at its Memphis, Tennessee, restaurant. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement Friday that Mint Julep Restaurant Operations L.L.C., an independent restaurant company and franchisee of Irving, Texas-based casual dining chain Cheddars Casual Café, will pay $450,000 to 15 individuals to settle the EEOC lawsuit. ####  ##### The EEOC said Mint Julep, which operates 42 Cheddar Café restaurants, permitted sexual conversations and jokes and allowed a general manager and bar manager to subject several female employees to sexual harassment at the Memphis restaurant. ####  ##### The EEOC said also that the restaurant managers made requests for sexual favors and explicit sexual comments, subjected female employees to unwelcome touching, and did not respond to complaints “in a prompt and appropriate manner.” ####  ##### The EEOC charged the company with sexual harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition to the monetary relief, settlement terms include mandatory anti-harassment training and maintenance of workplace cameras, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “Having and disseminating an anti-harassment policy does not satisfy federal prohibitions against sexual harassment,” said regional attorney Faye Williams of EEOC's Memphis District Office, which serves Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Mississippi, in a statement. “Employers must also enforce it. When an employer allows its managers to abuse its female employees in these ways and allows a sexually hostile work environment to persist, it is obviously not enforcing its anti-harassment policy. An unenforced policy is tantamount to having no policy at all.” ####  ##### Court papers say the settlement does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing by Mint Julep. ####  ##### Its attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### Last year, the EEOC reached a $160,000 settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit against Red Lobster Restaurants L.L.C., in which a manager was charged with sexually harassing three female employees. #### "
"Women to Watch: Where are they now …";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, AIG, General liability";" ##### It's been 10 years since Business Insurance started the Women to Watch program.

She's a regular lecturer at conferences and other events around the world. She sits on the boards of two public companies and mentors young lawyers. ####  ##### She says she'll keep going as long as she enjoys the work. ####  ##### “I would say that I think my generation is realizing that life doesn't end at 65 like it did a generation ago,” she said. “You can continue to do what you love, as long as you are healthy, and to me, this is where I want to be. I can't see myself on a beach unless it's vacation.” ####  ##### Her experience spans decades and includes work as outside and insurance counsel, working closely with boards of directors, general counsel and in-house legal teams to help clients design and implement effective governance and compliance programs. She also advises boards and executives on crisis management. ####  ##### No longer in the insurance industry per se—she worked at AIG for three years — Ms. Kelly says her work is not unlike what she did in the legal department of one of the country's largest insurance companies. ####  ##### She joined DLA Piper in 2010 as a partner and then, in 2013, was named a co-managing partner of DLA Piper Americas, the first women to hold that position. Besides that, she co-chairs the Global Governance and Compliance practice and is a member of the firm's Global Board and Executive Committee. ####  ##### “I deal with people all the time, I work with clients all the time and I do a lot of work internally with my partners,” she said. “When I was at AIG, I ran a large legal department and I interacted a lot with members of the C-suite. When you are dealing with people in whatever capacity, there are a lot of similarities.” ####  ##### Ms. Kelly's departure from AIG made headlines; she didn't accept a pay cut under the AIG bailout orchestrated by President Barack Obama's administration at the height of the financial crisis. The move would have halved her salary; instead she left the embattled company with a severance reported by Reuters as $2.8 million. ####  ##### “I look fondly at my time at AIG because I was there at the height of the crisis,” she said. “There is nothing better than a good crisis for a lawyer.” ####  ##### Before AIG she was general counsel for several major companies and is credited with helping MCI/WorldCom MCI Inc. (formed by the merger of MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.) out of bankruptcy before the telecommunications giant was bought by Verizon Communications Inc. in 2006. In 1999 Ms. Kelly was recruited by Sears Roebuck and Co. as a senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary to help the large Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer manage compliance and credit woes. ####  ##### She uses her experience to not only help clients but also to mentor a number of women lawyers. She is also a member of DLA Piper's Leadership Alliance for Women, an initiative that works to hire, retain and advance female lawyers. ####  ##### As a mother, Ms. Kelly said she likes to encourage women. A story well-known among her colleagues, she was in labor with her twin boys when she took a conference call — dedication that kept her on the track to partner at the Washington D.C. law firm now known as Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr L.L.P. ####  ##### Today her 26-year-old sons work for hedge funds in New York. ####  ##### Among her best advice is to take risks but to listen to your instincts. ####  ##### “The one thing you have to be is true to your moral compass,” she said. “You have to listen to that little voice when something looks like it is not right, it probably isn't. You owe it to yourself to look into it. It's part instinct, part judgment.” ####  ##### Watch for the next profile in our ""Where are they now..."" series next month.

"FAA taps experts to write rules for flying drones over people";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Regulation, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability, Aviation";" ##### A task force of manufacturers, aviation industry associations and others who have a vested interest in small unmanned aircraft systems are meeting to determine an acceptable risk level when drones fly above people. ####  ##### The Federal Aviation Administration said Feb. 24 that the aviation rulemaking committee, comprising 26 entities including AT&T Technologies, Intel Corp. and GoogleX, has until the end of the month to come up with recommendations for safely operating “certain” unmanned aircraft systems when flying over people or under a covered structure. ####  ##### Last year the FAA was thinking of creating a new class of “micro” drones, any UAS less than 4.4 pounds and made out of materials that “break, distort or yield on impact,” to minimize damage if it crashed and struck a person or object. The intention was to allow micro drones to fly over people. ####  ##### However, the FAA decided not to have weight as the defining factor. ####  ##### Instead, a safe operation category will base UAS rules on performance criteria such as speed. ####  ##### “Based on the comments about a 'micro' classification submitted as part of the small UAS proposed rule, the FAA will pursue a flexible, performance-based regulatory framework that addresses potential hazards instead of a classification defined primarily by weight and speed,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in the statement. ####  ##### Some of the considerations in making the performance-based choices are current and past research on human injury thresholds, hazard and risk assessment methodologies and “acceptable levels of risk” for bystanders not involved in operating the drone, the statement said. ####  ##### The committee has also been asked to figure out how manufacturers can prove a UAS meets the performance-based safety requirements and find ways for the FAA to verify that the UAS comply. ####  ##### On Dec. 21, the FAA began requiring the registration of all UAS weighing more than 0.55 pounds. Civil penalties for not registering a drone include a fine up to $27,500. Criminal penalties could mean fines of up to $250,000 and up to three years in prison. ####  ##### Nearly 300,000 owners registered their drones within the first 30 days after the FAA's online registration went live. That system is only for hobbyists, but the agency is working to open it to commercial operators by March 21. #### "
"VW faces Allianz suit over share drop; jobs under threat after scandal";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, Allianz, Germany, Auto liability, Gallery";" ##### (Reuters) — German insurer Allianz S.E. plans to sue Volkswagen A.G. over the sharp drop in its shares as a result of the carmaker's diesel emissions scandal, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. ####  ##### If successful, the lawsuit would add to financial pressures on Volkswagen that its chief executive said on Tuesday would be “substantial and painful.” ####  ##### At the same time, the company's labor leader warned that the extent of possible job cuts at VW would depend “decisively” on the level of U.S. fines for its cheating of emissions tests. ####  ##### “Should the future viability of Volkswagen be endangered by an unprecedented financial penalty, this will have dramatic social consequences,” works council chairman Bernd Osterloh told more than 20,000 workers at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. ####  ##### The “Dieselgate” scandal has forced out the previous CEO, tarnished one of Germany's most renowned corporate brands and driven down VW's share price by 31% since it emerged last September. ####  ##### According to Thomson Reuters data, Allianz Global Investors holds 0.06 percent of VW preference shares and just 10,000 ordinary shares, so will have lost some €8.6 million ($9.5 million) on its stake. ####  ##### The source said the Allianz lawsuit would happen “within this month.” Allianz said in a statement it had not yet filed an actoin against VW but was weighing a suit. ####  ##### The action will add to VW's litigation risks in Germany, where the carmaker already faces dozens of private lawsuits. ####  ##### But it is dwarfed by the potential costs in the United States, where the Justice Department has sued VW for up to $46 billion for breaching U.S. environmental laws. ####  ##### More than 500 lawsuits have been filed against the company in the United States, and there is still no fix for nearly 600,000 cars affected there. ####  ##### Risk to jobs ####  ##### Mr. Osterloh, who also sits on VW's 20-member supervisory board, called on the U.S. authorities to consider the risk of possible job cuts in deciding on penalties. “We very much hope that the U.S. authorities also have an eye for this social and employment-political dimension,” he said. ####  ##### Europe's largest automaker employs over 600,000 people at around 120 factories worldwide, including 270,000 in Germany. Its U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, employs about 2,200 people. ####  ##### Speaking at the Wolfsburg meeting, CEO Matthias Mueller said the scandal would inflict “substantial and painful” financial damage on the carmaker, without elaborating. ####  ##### Volkswagen last year set aside €6.7 billion ($7.39 billion) to cover the expected costs of recalling about 11 million diesel vehicles globally. It has postponed the release of its 2015 results by more than a month until April 28 to better assess the financial implications of the crisis. ####  ##### Outside the United States, France has opened a formal investigation into suspected “aggravated fraud” by VW, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Tuesday. ####  ##### “The software manipulations and its consequences will keep us busy for a long time,” Mr. Mueller said, adding that it would take years to determine the full extent of the financial impact. ####  ##### The state of Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, expects more “unpleasant news” to emerge over the months ahead but remains confident that the company has the financial strength to cope. ####  ##### “We will this year probably every now and then be confronted with unpleasant news related to 'Dieselgate',” Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, told the Wolfsburg meeting. ####  ##### “The damage will, on balance, not be minor, that much can already be said today, but Volkswagen luckily has a strong economic base,” Mr. Weil, also a member of the supervisory board, said. ####  ##### The Western German state, which holds 20% of VW's common shares, has “no reason” to alter its commitment to the carmaker despite the crisis, said Mr. Weil, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrat coalition partners. ####  ##### Separately, German prosecutors said on Tuesday they have widened their investigation into the emissions scandal and are now targeting 11 more employees. ####  ##### Klaus Ziehe from the state prosecutor's office in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, which is leading the German case against VW, said 17 people were now being investigated, up from six previously. ####  ##### “The number of suspects has risen, although none are from the management board,” Mr. Ziehe said. #### "
"Raytheon faces $1 billion whistleblower lawsuit";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, Regulation, Risk Management, Financial Results, Emerging Risks, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Monday revived a $1 billion lawsuit accusing defense contractor Raytheon Co. of fraudulently overbilling the federal government under a contract to develop a weather sensor for a costly environmental satellite system. ####  ##### By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said the engineer Steven Mateski could pursue claims that Raytheon violated the federal False Claims Act for at least a decade starting in 2002. ####  ##### The court said Mateski's claims went beyond publicly disclosed problems in developing the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which suffered from delays and cost overruns, including problems outlined in a U.S. Government Accountability Office report from November 2005. ####  ##### ""If his allegations prove to be true, Mateski will undoubtedly have been one of those whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information, rather than an opportunistic plaintiff who has no significant information to contribute,"" Circuit Judge Michelle Friedland wrote for the appeals court. ####  ##### Raytheon is based in Waltham, Massachusetts, and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mateski's lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests. ####  ##### Mateski alleged that Raytheon, his employer from 1997 to 2006, mismanaged its subcontract to develop the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor for the NPOESS, on which Northrop Grumman Corp held the main contract. ####  ##### Friedland said it would be unfair to the government and whistleblowers to impose a ""public disclosure bar"" against False Claims Act lawsuits such as Mateski's that identified ""specific instances of fraud,"" where public documents such as the GAO report merely described ""problems"" or even ""generalized fraud."" ####  ##### Monday's decision overturned U.S. District Judge Otis Wright's February 2013 dismissal of the lawsuit, and returned the case to his Los Angeles courtroom. ####  ##### False Claims Act cases let whistleblowers pursue claims on behalf of the government and share in recoveries. The United States in 2012 decided not to help Mateski pursue his case. ####  ##### The case is U.S. ex rel Mateski v. Raytheon Co, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-55341. #### "

""The normal disk image (was) replaced by the compromised one."" ####  ##### He added that ""security on the server has since been increased"" and that the group was in ""frequent contact"" with Apple as well as Palo Alto Networks Inc., which discovered the ransomware. ####  ##### The attack over the weekend was the first ransomware to breach Macs. ####  ##### Ransomware, one of the fastest-growing types of cyber threats, encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key to retrieve their data. ####  ##### Security experts estimate that ransoms total hundreds of millions of dollars a year from such cyber criminals, who typically target users of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system. ####  ##### Palo Alto Threat Intelligence Director Ryan Olson said the ""KeRanger"" malware, which appeared Friday, was the first functioning ransomware attacking Apple's Mac computers. ####  ##### ""This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom,"" Mr. Olson said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### Hackers infected Macs through the tainted program known as Transmission, which is used to transfer data through the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network, Palo Alto said on a blog posted on Sunday afternoon. ####  ##### When users downloaded version 2.90 of Transmission, which was released Friday, their Macs were infected with the ransomware, the blog said. ####  ##### An Apple representative said the company had taken steps over the weekend to prevent further infections by revoking a digital certificate that enabled the rogue software to install on Macs. The representative declined to provide other details. ####  ##### Transmission responded by removing the malicious version of its software from its website, www.transmissionbt.com. On Sunday it released a version that its website said automatically removes the ransomware from infected Macs. ####  ##### The website advised Transmission users to immediately install the new update, version 2.92, if they suspected they might be infected. ####  ##### Palo Alto said on its blog that KeRanger is programmed to stay quiet for three days after infecting a computer, then connect to the attacker's server and start encrypting files so they cannot be accessed. ####  ##### After encryption is completed, KeRanger demands a ransom of 1 bitcoin, or about $400, the blog said. ####  ##### Mr. Olson, the Palo Alto threat intelligence director, said that the victims whose machines were compromised but not cleaned up could start losing access to data on Monday, which is three days after the virus was loaded onto Transmission's site. #### "

"Zurich slashes pay for top management after poor 2015";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Zurich, Switzerland";" ##### (Reuters) — Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. cut 2015 pay for its top management by more than half after they failed to meet major performance targets, the Swiss insurer said in its annual report published Friday. ####  ##### Total 2015 pay for the 13 members of Zurich's top management team was $22.6 million, a big drop from the $55.4 million received by 12 executives in 2014. ####  ##### Zurich's shares fell 17% last year, the stock's worst performance since 2008, in response to a sluggish performance in its flagship general insurance business and back-to-back quarterly profit warnings. In contrast, the European insurance sector index rose 14%. ####  ##### Zurich said in its annual report that the key metric in connection with the managers' pay was net income attributable to shareholders, which fell 53% in 2015. ####  ##### Former Chief Executive Martin Senn, who left the company suddenly in December, was paid 2.5 million Swiss francs ($2.52 million) in 2015, less than a third of the 8.5 million francs ($8.57 million) he got in 2014. ####  ##### Mr. Senn had come under pressure following a failed takeover bid for Britain's RSA Insurance Group P.L.C. and a weak performance from Zurich's main business. ####  ##### Last month, Zurich appointed Generali CEO Mario Greco to replace Mr. Senn. Mr. Greco is set to take up his new job on Monday. #### "

"Former Chesapeake CEO charged with bid rigging ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Aubrey McClendon, former chief executive officer of Chesapeake Energy Corp and a legend in the U.S. energy industry, was charged on Tuesday with conspiring to rig bids to buy oil and natural gas leases in Oklahoma, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### The indictment follows a nearly four-year federal antitrust probe that began after a 2012 Reuters investigation found that Chesapeake had discussed with a rival how to suppress land lease prices in Michigan during a shale-drilling boom. Although the Michigan case was subsequently closed, investigators uncovered evidence of alleged bid-rigging in Oklahoma. ####  ##### In addition to the federal probe, the Michigan attorney general brought criminal charges against Chesapeake, which the company settled in 2015 by agreeing to pay $25 million into a compensation fund for land owners. ####  ##### The Justice Department indictment paves the way for what may be one of the highest-profile criminal antitrust cases against a well-known U.S. CEO in decades, and could thrust McClendon, a controversial figure whose aggressive leasing tactics are legendary in the energy industry, into the highest-stakes legal battle of a decades-long career. ####  ##### Oklahoma-based McClendon is a shale drilling evangelist who was once among the highest paid U.S. CEOs. He co-founded Chesapeake with fellow Oklahoma oilman Tom Ward in 1989. In 2013, McClendon stepped down from the helm of Chesapeake amid a liquidity crunch and corporate governance concerns. Ward left Chesapeake in 2006 and founded competitor SandRidge Energy Inc the same year. ####  ##### McClendon, who is now with American Energy Partners (AEP), was charged with one count of conspiracy to rig bids, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### ""The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,"" McClendon said in statement. ""I have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the Sherman Act became law to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold."" ####  ##### Chesapeake itself is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, the company said. ####  ##### ""Chesapeake has been actively cooperating for some time with a criminal antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice regarding past land leasing practices,"" said Chesapeake Energy spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. ""Chesapeake does not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines relating to this matter."" ####  ##### Chesapeake shares declined 3.6% in after-hours trading to $2.66. ####  ##### The seven-page indictment alleges that McClendon set up a conspiracy of two energy companies which agreed not to bid against each other in purchasing oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma from 2007 to 2012. The indictment did not name either company. ####  ##### The indictment comes at a time when energy executives across America are already facing considerable distress. Oil and gas companies like Chesapeake, SandRidge, and McClendon's new venture AEP, have struggled as the price of oil plummeted by 70% since late 2014. ####  ##### Both Chesapeake and SandRidge, once storied firms in Oklahoma's oil industry, have recently engaged restructuring experts as they scramble to pay off billions in debt and avoid potential bankruptcy. Chesapeake's stock price has tumbled more than 80% in the last year. SandRidge was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in January, and closed Tuesday at 4 cents per share. ####  ##### Much of the companies' debt was accrued in the period from 2007 through 2012 when McClendon was allegedly engaged in an antitrust conspiracy, a time when Chesapeake was snapping up millions of acres of land leases nationwide to expand its shale drilling. ####  ##### McClendon has also been embroiled in a lawsuit with Chesapeake which alleged that he took sensitive company data from his former company to build his new business. ####  ##### The Justice Department said that McClendon's indictment was the first case in an ongoing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anti-competitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry. ####  ##### ""His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions,"" said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer, head of Justice Department's Antitrust Division. ####  ##### Chesapeake, SandRidge, and McClendon had previously disclosed in securities filings that they were being investigated by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. #### "
"Work hours lawsuit could signal more health care litigation";"Risk Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability";" ##### More employers can expect litigation comparable to the lawsuit filed by a former restaurant worker, whose lawsuit, where she claimed her employer cut her hours to part-time to avoid Affordable Care Act costs, has successfully survived a motion to dismiss. ####  ##### To protect themselves against potential lawsuits, employers should carefully monitor any communications to workers on workforce reductions to avoid any suggestion they are being made to save money under the ACA, legal experts suggest. ####  ##### Last month, a U.S. District judge refused to dismiss a putative class action lawsuit filed in May 2015 by Maria De Lourdes Parra Marin in Maria De Lourdes Parra Marin v. Dave & Buster's Inc. et al. ####  ##### Ms. Marin had charged that, in response to the ACA's enactment, managers at a New York restaurant operated by Dallas-based Dave & Buster's told workers that to avoid costs totaling as much as $2 million it would reduce its full-time workers to 40 from more than 100, according to the Feb. 9 ruling by the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ####  ##### She said she was then reduced from full- to part-time status, causing a reduction in pay to a range of $150 to $375 per week from $450 to $600 per week, along with a loss of eligibility for medical and vision benefits, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Marin then filed suit, charging discrimination under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein denied Dave & Buster's motion to dismiss the case in his ruling. ####  ##### “Plaintiff has put forward factual allegations supporting her claim that the employer had the specific intent to interfere with her right to health insurance,” the ruling said. “The reduction in plaintiff's hours affected her employment, her pay, and the benefits she had and to which she would be entitled.” ####  ##### Experts say while they believe this may be the first such ruling in litigation filed over the issue of cutting back hours because of the ACA, more can be expected. ####  ##### They also point out the case itself is still in its very early stages. “This was just a motion to dismiss. The court didn't get into a determination of whether there was evidence” the employer had violated the ACA by intentionally manipulating hours and employees to avoid coverage, said Marc D. Katz, a partner with Andrews Kurth L.L.P. in Dallas. All the ruling said was that if, theoretically, the worker could prove what she claimed, there was a violation, he said. ####  ##### “There's definitely the potential for more” litigation on this issue, said David L. Barron, a member of law firm Cozen O'Connor in Houston. ####  ##### Even though the law has been around since 2010, it is only now “we're getting into the full swing” of its implementation, said Stephen J. Evans, an associate with Armstrong Teasdale L.L.P. in St. Louis. There has not been a lot of litigation in this area of ERISA, “and the ability to get attorney's fees and form a class action might make it an attractive area for a lawsuit,” he said. ####  ##### The New York ruling “certainly makes these types of lawsuits more attractive to plaintiffs' attorneys,” said Daniel T. Sulton, a shareholder with Ogletree, Deakins Smoak & Stewart P.C. in Greenville, South Carolina. ####  ##### “It's discouraging news to employers, who have always had legitimate reasons for business restructuring,” he said. ####  ##### Experts advise employers to be cautious about what they tell their workers. “The big picture is, before you make changes, or react to the ACA or any other law, that you would consult with your legal counsel and your consultant and make sure to manage any communications that are put out to employees,” so that you are not conveying the message that any changes are based on the cost of benefits, Mr. Evans said. ####  ##### If there is a cutback in hours, “It's probably not wise to have supervisors openly blaming it on (the ACA), or saying anything like that,” Mr. Barron said. ####  ##### However, “This should not prevent an employer from moving someone from a benefit-eligible position to a non-benefit eligible position, so long as the rationale behind it is not on a discriminatory basis, or there's an intent to interfere with someone's benefits,” Mr. Sulton said. ####  ##### Employers, though, should have “clear documentation” as to their legitimate business rationale for the job restructuring, Mr. Sulton said. #### "
"Airborne bachelor party horseplay turns risky ";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Aviation, Off Beat";" ##### Probably not the best idea to mix international flights and drunken bachelor parties but one bridegroom and 11 of his pals thought otherwise. ####  ##### The group boarded a jet Friday night in London heading to Bratislava, Slovakia, while overly intoxicated, according to news reports. ####  ##### Barely able to stand, the lads became belligerent when the cabin crew refused to serve them more alcohol. The Ryanair plane's captain decided to make an unscheduled landing in Berlin's Schönefeld Airport 30 minutes after takeoff, to avoid the risk of the party members inflicting harm to other passengers, news reports said. ####  ##### German police escorted six of the drunken dozen from Southampton, England off the plane after the pilot made the Berlin stop, putting an end to the stag party — which by then had mostly downgraded to an in the aisle drunken fist fight between two of the groomsmen. The groom-to-be was one of the six escorted off by police, and the remainder of the party continued on to their destination without him. ####  ##### The group did not comply with cabin crew instructions and posed a security threat by reportedly refusing to stay in their seats while engaging in “horseplay.” One had allegedly stripped naked in front of the 170 passengers, German federal police said in a statement. ####  ##### The men, ages 25-28, that were removed from their party were charged with misdemeanors from air security law violations and facing fines up to $27,000, according to German police. The airline can also sue them. ####  ##### Banning drunk people from boarding planes, capping the number of drinks that can be served and keeping a blacklist of unruly passengers have all been taken into consideration by U.K. ministers, news reports said. ####  ##### Since their release, no reports have been made on the level of hangover experienced in the aftermath. #### "
"A few bad apples may be harming captives' reputation";"Risk Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Emerging Risks, General liability";" ##### The health of the captive insurance market has been good overall, but one captive manager is concerned that the behaviors of some members could damage the industry's reputation. ####  ##### In a Feb. 10 webinar presented by Strategic Risk Solutions that reviewed the past year for captives and gave projections for 2016, it was said that many captives are overcapitalized and doing quite well, according to Brady Young, president and CEO of captive manager Strategic Risk Solutions Inc. in Concord, Massachusetts. ####  ##### But he said some owners are in captives that should never have been formed in the first place, and these few could be seeing trouble ahead. ####  ##### “There has been too much aggressive selling. While these captives are solvent, the owners have been exposed to tax risks, and a lot of that is coming home to roost,” he said during the webinar for existing and prospective captive owners. ####  ##### The captive manager reported captive industry growth was strong at 4.8% for 2015, but much lower than the 8.6% for 2014, partly because of IRS scrutiny and the newly minted 831(b) election that changes the way small captives can be structured, he said. ####  ##### Mr. Young was also concerned about the large risks going into captives for cyber exposures. ####  ##### “Carriers are writing all this cyber liability insurance for really cheap premiums and chasing the market,” he said, “and at some point the losses are going to come.” ####  ##### He said he is concerned about the health of the industry when people do things that put the whole industry in a negative spotlight. ####  ##### “I am hoping there is going to be a shakeout, and the stupid things that are getting done are stopped, and the people who shouldn't be in the business, leave the business,” he said. “Then those who are trying to do things the right way can continue to have opportunities in the future.” ####  ##### As the soft market continues with no event, it places market pressure on captives as well, he said. ####  ##### “There just hasn't been big problems in most industries; things that happened 10 or 20 years ago seem like the Stone Ages,” he said, “and I think there will be some pressure on mature captives to stay around.” ####  ##### He said “it's been so long since we've had a hard market where anyone has felt any pain or volatility” that it is difficult to remember the purpose of a captive. ####  ##### “At some point the market may harden, and people are going to have to use their captive or come up with another solution because the risk is not getting smaller, it's getting bigger,” he said. ####  ##### Cell closures were reported in the webinar to be over 75% higher in 2015 than 2014, but the reasons for the closures varied. Some small captives were closed because of concerns from IRS investigations, some were parent company acquisitions, and some were chalked up to soft market conditions. ####  ##### Redomestication also caused some of the closures, but this led to new captives cropping up in the organization's home state with the prediction that as long as the home state has captive laws and “receptive regulators,” that trend will continue into 2016. #### "
"Ink finally dry on Exor acquisition of PartnerRe";"Risk Management";"Partner Re, Bermuda, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### Exor S.p.A has completed its acquisition of PartnerRe Ltd., Turin, Italy-based Exor announced Friday. ####  ##### The announcement was the final act in a takeover battle that pitted Exor against Pembroke, Bermuda-based Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. ####  ##### Axis Capital had initially offered to acquire Pembroke, Bermuda-based PartnerRe in an $11 billion cash-and-stock deal in January 2015.

A tie means they split it. ####  ##### “Think of it as the ultimate 'office pool,' with the parent company providing the prize,” Mr. Buffett said in a memo to Berkshire managers explaining the contest rules. ####  ##### Each March, 68 teams are selected for the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, known as March Madness. ####  ##### The “lollapalooza prize,” according to Mr. Buffet is won if “a single entrant has a perfect bracket to the round of 16, there will be the sweet award of an annuity paying $1 million a year for the remaining life of that entrant.” ####  ##### In other words, the bracket would have every game outcome called correctly through the first two rounds of forty-eight games so that it has all the correct teams remaining in the final 16. ####  ##### “If they go through two bracket tests and make it to the 'Sweet Sixteen' they get a million dollars a year for life,” Mr. Buffet told CNBC hosts on Feb. 29. ####  ##### Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 361,000 employees. ####  ##### Prize indemnity insurance is provided by National Indemnity Co., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Prize indemnity insurance providers get a premium that varies depending on the odds of someone winning.

"Industry sees a big year of mergers and acquisitions";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Mergers & Acquisitions, P/C Pricing";" ##### The volume of merger and acquisition activity in the insurance industry more than quadrupled in 2015, to $194.9 billion from $43.8 billion in 2014, with additional major activity expected, particularly in the property/casualty sector, according to a study issued Wednesday. ####  ##### There were 24 transactions valued at $1 billion or more in 2015, compared to nine in 2014 in the property/casualty, life and health sectors, with M&A activity also distinguished by the prevalence of strategic rather than financial buyers, according to the study by Hartford, Connecticut-based investment management firm Conning & Co. The number of transactions was relatively unchanged at 183, however. ####  ##### Among property/casualty insurers the aggregate value of M&A deals increased to $39.6 billion in 2015 from $6.7 billion in 2014, driven by several large transactions, including Ace Ltd. and Chubb Corp.'s deal, according to the executive summary of the report, “Global Insurer Mergers & Acquisitions in 2015, The Big Bang.” ####  ##### “Key themes in the year included the desirability of specialty and Lloyd's targets, large acquisitions by Japanese and Chinese buyers, reinsurance consolidation, and combinations in sectors facing strong external challenges, such as crop insurance and medical professional liability,” said the study. ####  ##### The report predicts continued M&A activity. “The recurring themes of consolidation, product and geographic diversification suggest that more insurers will seek partners to keep up with large competitors,” the report says. ####  ##### In the health insurance and managed care sector, the $100.8 billion of aggregate transaction volume, which accounted for more than half of the year's $195 billion in global activity, compared with just $33 millionof disclosed deal value in 2014, said the report. The number of transactions also increased to 22 in 2015 from 13 in 2014. ####  ##### The transactions were stimulated by implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the report. “Growth in government-subsidized programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, accompanied by the retreat of traditional employer-based plans in favor of high-deductible plans and exchanges, generated pressure to acquire Medicaid and Medicare providers and build scale to generate efficiencies,” according to the report. ####  ##### In 2016, “with so many of the largest insurers having entered into transactions in 2015, it is likely that activity in 2016 will involve combinations among second-tier players,” the study says. #### "

"Fired Hilton hotel clerk's age and reverse discrimination case reinstated";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court ruling in a reverse discrimination case and reinstated a racial and age discrimination lawsuit filed by a hotel's terminated white front desk clerk who was in her 60s. ####  ##### Valeri Kay Kilgore began working as a front-desk agent for Hilton Garden Inc., a unit of McLean, Virginia-based Hilton Worldwide, in 2011, according to Thursday's ruling by the 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals in Atlanta in Valarie Kay Kilgore v. Trussville Development L.L.C. d.b.a. Hilton Garden Inc. ####  ##### In February 2012, the front desk manager, who was her supervisor, asked Ms. Kilgore to train two new part-time front desk agents who were young and African-American females with no front-desk experience, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore was told the new hires were to work at a sister property, but they remained at Ms. Kilgore's hotel Trussville, Alabama, and her hours were reduced because of the new hires. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore alleged that a number of discriminatory comments were made to her, including the hotel's general manager telling her, “You are old, Katie. Where's your sense of humor. Can't you remember what that is? You did hear me, right?” The front desk manager was black, while the general manager was white, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore was terminated by the hotel in June 2012, allegedly for rude and discourteous behavior towards guests. She filed suit in U.S. District Court in Birmingham Alabama in March 2013, charging race and age discrimination, and the court granted Hilton summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### Ms. Kilgore appealed the ruling, and a three-judge appellate court unanimously reinstated the case. Ms. Kilgore “presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of both age and race discrimination, creating an inference of unlawful discrimination,” said the ruling, citing that the two African-American hires remained at the hotel after she was fired, and the comments that were allegedly made to Ms. Kilgore. The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings. ####  ##### In 2014, a federal appeals court upheld an $82,000 award to a white attorney who claimed he was the victim of discrimination by a black-majority hospital board that replaced him as the board attorney with a black attorney. #### "
"Loading up on cyber risk could be a negative for insurers' ratings";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### Uncertainties surrounding insurers' coverage of cyber risks now outweigh the benefits of their potential earnings growth from a ratings perspective, Fitch Ratings Inc. said in a report Monday. ####  ##### “At this stage, Fitch would view aggressive growth in stand-alone cyber coverage, or movement to high portfolio concentration in cyber, as a negative to the ratings,” according to the New York-based rating agency's report, “Global Cyber Insurance Market Update, Expanding Threats Amplify Underwriting Opportunity, Loss Potential.” ####  ##### “We believe the underwriting, pricing and reserving uncertainties currently outweigh the potential earnings growth benefits” of providing cyber insurance, according to Fitch. “Controlled growth as part of a diversified portfolio, coupled with continually enhanced underwriting standards, would generally be neutral to ratings.” ####  ##### The report said that while cyber coverage “represents a rare bright spot of positive premium rate movement” for the commercial insurance market, insurers “likely already have a considerable amount of cyber exposure embedded in existing commercial, property and liability policies. As such, an underwriter could have significant accumulations of cyber exposure before potentially adding to risk aggregations through writing stand-alone cyber policies. Practices for including cyber exclusions, sublimits and policy endorsements into existing policies are an evolving area of cyber risk management.” ####  ##### In addition, insurers “lack a meaningful volume of data on losses and exposures for cyber-related claims, which creates challenges in pricing risk and establishing pricing terms,” Fitch said in the report. ####  ##### Policyholders need advanced technical expertise and services for defense, and remediation processes following breaches, which leads to questions “whether any long-term role for insurers in cyber risk management will be usurped by more sophisticated firms or Internet providers,” although insurers are gaining more technical expertise, the rating agency said. #### "
"Lord & Taylor dressed down for Instagram promotion";"Risk Management";"Off Beat";" ##### A paisley print dress with an asymmetrical hemline that was described by one fashion website as having a “whimsical design perfect for summer” has gotten retailer Lord & Taylor L.L.C. into hot water with the Federal Trade Commission. ####  ##### The FTC charged last week that in March 2015, the New York-based retailer placed an article in a fashion magazine promoting the dress, which is part of its private label Design Lab collection, in an online fashion publication, Nylon, without disclosing that it was a paid promotion. ####  ##### Furthermore, Lord & Taylor also gave the dress, which originally sold for $88, free to 50 fashion “influencers,” and paid them between $1,000 and $4,000 each to post a photo of themselves wearing it on Instagram or another social media site. ####  ##### Lord & Taylor contractually obligated them to use the “@LordandTaylor” Instagram user designation and the hashtag “#DesignLab” in the caption of the photo they posted. ####  ##### The company also pre-approved each proposed post, but did not require the influencers to disclose they had compensated them to post the photo, and none of them did. The influencers’ posts reached 11.4 million individual Instagram users over just two days, according to the FTC. ####  ##### Under terms of the proposed settlement, which does not involve a fine, Lord & Taylor is prohibited from misrepresenting that paid ads are from an independent source, and is required to insure that its influencers clearly disclose when they have been compensated in exchange for their endorsement. ####  ##### Meanwhile, the dress quickly sold out, said the FTC. At this point, anyway, the 2015 dress is “so last year.” #### "

"Ruling may trigger more overtime suits";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, General liability";" ##### The U .S. Supreme Court's ruling that statistical evidence can be used to determine overtime wages points up the need for employers to keep records of how long it takes employees to change their work clothes. ####  ##### Some say the high court's 6-2 ruling last month in Tyson Foods Inc. v. Peg Bouaphakeo et al., over whether workers should be paid for overtime spent donning and doffing their work clothes in a pork processing plant, is narrowly written, but others say its impact could extend well beyond wage-and-hour claims. ####  ##### Observers also say the high court did not address the critical issue of whether a class could be certified if it included workers who were not injured — in this case, those who did not work overtime while changing their work clothes — and therefore had no legal right to any damages. ####  ##### The 3,344 workers in the case were employees of the kill, cut and retrim departments of the Storm Lake, Iowa, pork processing plant operated by Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson. ####  ##### The workers filed suit in Sioux City, Iowa, federal court in 2007 alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law. ####  ##### The district court certified the litigation as a class action in 2008. ####  ##### During the trial, evidence included a study including 744 videotaped observations by an industrial relations expert, Kenneth Mericle, who concluded that it took about 18 minutes a day for the cut and retrim departments to change cloths and 21.25 minutes for the kill department. A jury in September 2011 awarded the workers $2.9 million in overtime benefits. ####  ##### An August 2014 ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis upheld the lower court, as did the Supreme Court. ####  ##### In its ruling for the workers, the Supreme Court majority said that because the employer failed to keep proper records, “the representative evidence here was a permissible means” of showing the hours that had been worked. ####  ##### The ruling, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, also cautioned, however, that the “fairness and utility of statistical methods in context other than those presented here will depend on facts and circumstances particular to those cases.” ####  ##### In a dissent, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who was joined by Associate Justice Samuel Alito, said the majority had redefined class action requirements and devised an “unsound special evidentiary rule for cases” under the FLSA. ####  ##### While it is good the court has given some direction to plaintiffs and employers on the admissibility of statistical evidence, “we are going to see an uptick in litigation here” because plaintiffs can use it to sustain class proceedings, said Christopher R. Kazanowski, a partner at Honigman, Miller, Schwartz & Cohn L.L.P. in Detroit. ####  ##### Fine-tuning legal language ####  ##### The case could also affect class actions beyond wage-and-hour claims “because the court used pretty broad language to say they will not permit a categorical rejection of all statistical evidence,” he said. ####  ##### “Until we have opinions from other federal courts fleshing out the ruling, we're going to see additional litigation by plaintiff class action attorneys trying to broaden that narrow window and exception” in the ruling, said Kenneth L. Racowski, counsel at Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney P.C. in Philadelphia. ####  ##### “It's going to be easier for plaintiffs' lawyers to do less discovery, do less work” and provide evidence through expert witnesses, rather than having to spend a lot of time fighting over getting evidence admitted in wage-and-hour cases, said defense attorney Rebecca L. Torrey, a partner at Manatt Phelps & Phillips L.L.P. in Los Angeles. ####  ##### Others, however, believe the ruling's impact will be more limited. ####  ##### The decision “basically ratified the way that many of these cases are litigated now,” said Eric R. Magnus, a principal in Jackson Lewis P.C.'s Atlanta office. ####  ##### “I suspect the court had trouble punishing the employees because the employer didn't keep the kind of records they were supposed to have kept,” said P. Russell Perdew, a partner at Locke Lord L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### The ruling does point to the need for firms to keep track of their workers' overtime, experts say. It imposes a record-keeping burden on employers that might not have been a factor before, Mr. Racowski said. #### "

"JLT to cough up millions in Willis poaching lawsuit";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Aon, Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group, General liability, Willis Towers Watson";" ##### Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group P.L.C. will pay about £22 million ($31.3 million) to settle a lawsuit filed in London in which Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. alleged that JLT had poached its fine art, jewelry and specie division employees, JLT said Friday. ####  ##### Willis filed the suit against JLT, JLT Specialty Ltd. and former Willis employee David Gordon over the unauthorized recruiting of Mr. Gordon and other Willis employees in 2015. The suit came as Willis sought to sell the division and other operations to Miller Insurance Services L.L.P. ####  ##### “A provision of approximately £22 million will be charged as part of second-quarter results as a consequence of the settlement, relating to the settlement itself and associated costs, and is incremental to any previously raised litigation provisions,” said JLT in a statement posted on its website. “This charge will be treated as an exceptional item and included in net litigation costs, as it is unrelated to the underlying business and trading performance of the group.” ####  ##### JLT added that the terms of the settlement are “final and confidential, and the matter is now closed.” JLT declined further comment through an outside spokeswoman. ####  ##### Willis did not reply immediately regarding the settlement. ####  ##### JLT is also currently being sued for alleged poaching by Aon P.L.C. In a suit filed in February in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, Aon accused current JLT Specialty Insurance Services Inc. CEO Michael Rice and six others of violating their agreements not to compete against Aon for two years after leaving the company. ####  ##### The suit also accused JLT Specialty Insurance Services Inc. and JLT Re (North America) Inc. of inducing the former Aon employees to violate their noncompete agreements and a “coordinated effort” with “certain other former Aon and current JLT employees” to engage in “multiple raids on Aon's officers, employees and clients” since August 2014. #### "

"Designation of MetLife as SIFI 'arbitrary and capricious': Federal judge";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, MetLife";" ##### The Financial Stability Oversight Council ignored its own standards and made an “arbitrary and capricious” decision when it designated MetLife Inc. as a systemically important financial institution, according to a ruling by a federal judge. ####  ##### In an opinion issued late last month but not unsealed until Thursday, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer in the District of Columbia rescinded MetLife's designation as a SIFI, saying the FSOC's determination was “fatally flawed.” ####  ##### Two other insurers — American International Group Inc. and Prudential Insurance Co. — also have been designated as SIFIs subject to heightened reporting and stress test requirements, but MetLife was the only one to challenge the designation in court. ####  ##### SIFIs also are subject to “enhanced supervision” and “prudential standards,” but the Federal Reserve has yet to announce what that supervision and standards will be. ####  ##### “The Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined that 'material financial distress' at MetLife Inc. could 'pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States,'” Judge Collyer wrote, adding that the phrases stem from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which created FSOC, and were defined by FSOC in formal guidance issued years before MetLife's designation. ####  ##### “During the designation process, two of FSOC's definitions were ignored or, at least, abandoned,” Judge Collyer wrote. “Although an agency can change its statutory interpretation when it explains why, FSOC insists that it changed nothing. But clearly it did so. FSOC reversed itself on whether MetLife's vulnerability to financial distress would be considered and on what it means to threaten the financial stability of the United States.” ####  ##### She said FSOC also focused exclusively on the presumed benefits of its designation and ignored the potential costs. ####  ##### “While MetLife advances many other arguments against its designation, FSOC's unacknowledged departure from its guidance and express refusal to consider cost(s) require the court to rescind the final determination” that MetLife be designated a SIFI. ####  ##### Judge Collyer said she did not rule on MetLife's other arguments. ####  ##### “Having found fundamental violations of established administrative law, the court does not reach those arguments. For the reasons explained above, this court finds that the final determination was arbitrary and capricious,” Judge Collyer wrote. ####  ##### “I strongly disagree with the court's ruling,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who chairs the FSOC, in a statement issued Thursday. “This decision leaves one of the largest and most highly interconnected financial companies in the world subject to even less oversight than before the financial crisis.” ####  ##### “FSOC's authority to designate nonbank financial companies is a critical tool to address potential threats to financial stability, and it has made our financial system safer and more resilient,” said Mr. Lew. “We intend to continue defending vigorously the process and the integrity of FSOC's work, and I am confident that we will prevail.” #### "

"Judge cuts $18 million verdict for N.Y. financier's ex-employee";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, D&O, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — A federal judge on Thursday reduced by more than two-thirds the maximum sum a Swedish woman can recover after having prevailed in a jury trial against a New York financier she accused of sexual harassment and defamation. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said he would grant New York Global Group CEO Benjamin Wey a new damages trial unless his former employee, Hanna Bouveng, agreed by April 10 to have her damages award cut to $5.65 million from $18 million. ####  ##### In a 111-page decision, Judge Gardephe also upheld the jury’s finding of liability in the lawsuit, which accused Mr. Wey of coercing Ms. Bouveng into having sex, refusing his further advances and defaming her in a series of blog posts. ####  ##### “Based on the evidence at trial, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Wey’s sexual advances toward plaintiff were unwelcome, and that he knew they were unwelcome,” Judge Gardephe wrote. ####  ##### Mr. Wey’s lawyer had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Ms. Bouveng did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### In a Twitter post after the ruling, Mr. Wey declared “victory,” reiterating his claims that the lawsuit amounted to “extortion.” ####  ##### Mr. Wey was separately indicted in September on federal securities fraud charges for engineering Chinese “reverse mergers” and then manipulating stock prices to earn tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits. He has pleaded not guilty. ####  ##### The Bouveng trial garnered lurid tabloid headlines by pitting the young woman against a Wall Street financier about 20 years her senior. ####  ##### At trial, lawyers for Ms. Bouveng contended that Mr. Wey had engaged in a relentless campaign of harassment after hiring her in 2013 when she was 24, buying her gifts and demanding sexual favors in return. ####  ##### Ms. Bouveng’s lawyers said Mr. Wey’s actions led to sexual encounters before she rejected his further attempts, and that Mr. Wey fired her after discovering another man in her apartment, which he was helping to finance, in April 2014. ####  ##### After she filed her civil lawsuit, Mr. Wey wrote several disparaging articles in an online publication, TheBlot, controlled by FNL Media, a New York Global Group subsidiary. Both companies were also defendants. ####  ##### Mr. Wey’s lawyer, Glenn Colton, contended at trial that his client and Ms. Bouveng never had sex, and that Ms. Bouveng attempted to extort Mr. Wey after she was fired for substandard work. #### "

"Risk managers recall first time buying cyber cover";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Emerging Risks, Technology";" ##### The road to obtaining cyber insurance for the first time can be a long and arduous one, risk managers say. ####  ##### “It was a daunting, overwhelming process,” said Donna Stone, Houston-based director of insurance risk management at GDF Suez Energy North America Inc. ####  ##### “It took us a long time to get out of denial” and realize the need for a policy, she said. ####  ##### The Paris-based energy firm initially was concerned about operational risk, but then came the realization that it also had personal employee data such as driving and health records. ####  ##### In all, she said during the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s annual conference in San Diego, it was a two-year process to determine the need for cyber cover. ####  ##### She said the attitude of the company's board of directors was, “We don't know what we're buying, but we're too afraid not to buy, so let's do that.” ####  ##### The policy was renewed this year, which required the participation human resources, regulatory compliance and communications arms of GDF Suez Energy, she said. ####  ##### “We're still learning as we go,” Ms. Stone said. ####  ##### “It's a long process the first time” said Timothy J. Flaherty, manager of insurance risk management at Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Inc. One challenge, he said, is that insurers' offerings are different and “it's very time consuming” to compare them. ####  ##### Risk managers must conduct a gap analysis and work with their brokers he said. When it comes to the first time of getting cyber coverage, “underwriters want to understand how you're protecting yourself,” which cannot be accomplished by sending an email or flash drive, he said. ####  ##### This information is “kind of the crown jewels,” he said. In Alcoa's case, the company's chief security officer personally handed over the required information to its broker. ####  ##### “Make sure you know exactly who's getting the information and track that. Keep the spreadsheet on who has it,” Mr. Flaherty recommended. ####  ##### Obviously, senior management needs to be involved, which he said is “critical, especially when it comes to limits and retentions” decisions. #### "

"Q&A: Barry Dillard of Walt Disney World Resort";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### Barry Dillard serves on the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s board and is the director of claims management for the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. There, Mr. Dillard, who is a member of RIMS' Central Florida chapter, leads a team of cast members who manage all aspects of the company's claims management program, including compliance operations, workers compensation and general disability claims. Mr. Dillard also teaches business management courses as an associate professor at the University of Phoenix. He received a bachelor of science in marketing from Hampton University and a master of business administration from Webster University. Mr. Dillard recently spoke with Business Insurance Senior Editor Mark A. Hofmann about his professional life and his service with RIMS. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: How did you get into claims management? ####  ##### A: It wasn't my intention. I was graduating with a degree in marketing and fully intended to go into marketing, but an Aetna property/casualty representative came to my university. I introduced myself and, before I knew it, I ended up a claim representative for Aetna Casualty & Surety in Dallas. ####  ##### Q: What are the most challenging and rewarding aspects of your job at Disney? ####  ##### A: When I think of the most challenging things, they are the things that keep me working here as well. It's the scale and scope of our business. We have theme parks, water parks, resort hotels, and we have more buses than the local transit authority. And all of this is on a property about the size of the city of San Francisco. ####  ##### When I think about the rewarding part, it's that our teams do a great job taking care of our cast members and guests when they file a claim. It's rewarding having the privilege of leading these teams as they make a difference in people's lives. ####  ##### Q: What have you learned from your students during your stints as an educator? ####  ##### A: I teach mostly undergrad business management students who are adult learners. They bring their experiences to the classroom and give me different perspectives. And I do learn a lot from them — you can't teach and not learn. ####  ##### Q: What can the claims management and risk management professions do to draw more young people into the field? ####  ##### A: It's really just exposure. It's talking with universities to get more degree programs and courses added to curriculums and creating more internship opportunities. It's also exposing students earlier. At the high school level, students know what lawyers do and they know what other professions do, but they really don't know that much about what insurance professionals do. ####  ##### Q: As a RIMS board member, what do you see as the major issues facing the organization? ####  ##### A: One that strikes a chord with me is for us to continue to innovate. Organizations that stay static don't stay around. Our members' roles are constantly evolving, and our organization needs to lead the way for our members and the industry. ####  ##### Q: What are you looking forward to at this year's conference in San Diego? ####  ##### A: The conference has a lot to offer, particularly its educational opportunities. It's the one time of the year our partners, insurers, brokers and vendors are all in one place. #### "
"Using social media to keep eye on fraud";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Risk Management, Workers Comp Coverage";" ##### Looking through social media is an emerging and vital surveillance strategy for insurance companies wishing to investigate potential fraud, said a speaker at a session on advanced strategies in surveillance at the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s conference Tuesday in San Diego. ####  ##### “It's fundamental we investigate social media,” said Steve Cassell, Lake Mary, Florida-based president and CEO of Command Investigations L.L.C. “It can't be overlooked or ignored.” ####  ##### With 80% of people age 18 to 49 using such Internet sites as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to keep in touch with friends and family, the chances of a claimant using social media is high enough to warrant a thorough look when trying to ascertain whether the claim is legitimate, according to Mr. Cassell. ####  ##### “Just think about how many of your claimants fit” in the ages and demographics, said Mr. Cassell, who provided statistics from the Washington-based Pew Research Center of who's on social media. ####  ##### “There's so much available at our fingertips,” added Andy Olwert, Sarasota, Florida-based president of SUNZ Insurance Co., who presented alongside Mr. Cassell. ####  ##### Mr. Olwert said he wants to see more insurers and other organizations investigate claims using information that is publicly available, because the savings can be profound. ####  ##### Take the case of the football player presented at Tuesday's session. In side-by-side videos, Mr. Cassell showed a legal video deposition of a man placed on no-work status after being diagnosed with “neck sprain, right shoulder pain and back sprain,” according to Mr. Cassell's slides. The man, questioned by an attorney not pictured in the video was asked to rate his pain on a scale of 1 to 10. “It gets up to a 10,” the man said, in a low and confident tone, pointing to his shoulder and neck. ####  ##### Beside the window featuring the man's deposition was silent video, recorded by an investigator, of the man playing football just days after his alleged injury. The side-by-side presentation of what the man said and what he did on his free time and posted on social media ignited chuckles from the audience. ####  ##### Mr. Cassell, whose company worked on the case, said the insurance adjuster spotted some red flags in his initial deposition and called for a social media investigation, which revealed that had been playing with an adult football league. The investigator found the team's practice and game schedule and subsequently recorded the man tackling, running, catching and more. According to Mr. Cassell the insurer facing the man's claim spent $235 on a social media investigation and $4,000 on real-time surveillance. The company saved an estimated $87,000 and averted a potential permanent total disability claim, he said. The man is now facing criminal charges. ####  ##### Mr. Cassell urged attendees to enlist the help of a vendor with the experience to use a social media approach. ####  ##### Mr. Olwert said the challenge lies in the nature of the insurance industry itself, and that the solution is to involve every department in the end result — the savings. #### "
"Holding company sets out to focus on smaller, independent MGAs";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A group of investors has launched a managing general agent-focused holding company Doxa Insurance Holdings L.L.C. ####  ##### Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Doxa is a company built to partner with and acquire small to medium, independently owned and operated managing general agents that focus on specialty commercial property and casualty niches, Doxa said in a Tuesday statement. ####  ##### Lead investor Matthew Sackett is the former senior vice president of national sales for Fort Wayne-based K&K Insurance Group Inc. and former president and CEO of Fort Wayne-based Leisure Sports Specialists L.L.C., according to the statement. ####  ##### “Medium and small MGAs are often overlooked by firms that are actively acquiring within the insurance industry. The 'bigger is better' mindset prevails,” Mr. Sackett, CEO of Doxa Insurance Holdings said in the statement. “From our experience, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge, passion, and creativity within what the industry refers to as a small MGA.” #### "

Prior to joining AIG in 2012, he held a variety of roles at what now is Marsh L.L.C., most recently as U.S. property placement leader, Endurance said in a statement. ####  ##### Global Risk Solutions, launched earlier this year, targets large-account risk management clients. ####  ##### The new platform, headed by Global Risk Solutions CEO Michael Chang, has put its initial focus on the real estate and hospitality, financial institutions and professional services industries. ####  ##### Mr. Nardiello's “deep property product knowledge and extensive experience in our target industry classes, both as an underwriter and a broker, will differentiate us in these key markets,” Mr. Chang said in the statement. #### "
"Latest Gallagher purchase adds retail broker with construction expertise ";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Risk Management, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Mergers & Acquisitions, Construction";" ##### Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. said it has acquired a Waite Park, Minnesota, retail insurance broker known for its construction expertise. ####  ##### Itasca, Illinois-based Gallagher said Monday that it has purchased Charles Allen Agency Inc. for an undisclosed sum. ####  ##### Founded in 2010, Charles Allen provides commercial surety bonding and insurance services — including property, general liability and workers compensation coverage — in the Midwest and specializes in construction industry coverage. ####  ##### Charles Allen CEO Mark Gresser and his associates will continue to operate from their current location under the direction of Michael Pesch, head of Gallagher's Midwest region retail property/casualty operation, Gallagher said in a statement. ####  ##### “Their construction expertise and Minnesota presence will be a wonderful complement to our Midwest region,” J. Patrick Gallagher Jr., Gallagher's president and CEO, said in the statement. ####  ##### “We are excited about becoming part of the Gallagher organization,” Mr. Gresser said in an interview, while declining to go into detail. ####  ##### No decision has been made about the Charles Allen brand, a Gallagher spokeswoman said in an email. ####  ##### The purchase is the latest for the acquisitive Gallagher. Last week, the brokerage said it acquired Oklahoma City-based Capitol Benefits Group, an employee benefits insurance broker that provides employee benefits insurance products and consulting services to small and middle-market businesses and individual clients in the U.S. ####  ##### Gallagher is the world's fourth-largest broker, according to the latest Business Insurance ranking. #### "
"Arbitration clause ruling against employer could breed new level of caution ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### A federal judge's ruling that invalidated an employee arbitration agreement because it was ambiguous is likely to spur employers to design such agreements more carefully, an expert says. ####  ##### U.S.-based mortgage loan officers of Madrid-based Banco Santander S.A. filed suit against the bank and its affiliates last June alleging the bank failed to pay them and more than 1,000 other workers minimum wages and overtime under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act and New Jersey's wage-and-hour law ####  ##### The loan officers alleged that on weekdays they worked on mortgage files from home before their workday started; that their lunch breaks were frequently interrupted to handle customer services issues; and spent additional time working after the bank closed during the week and on weekends. They allege they were never compensated for the extra hours worked. ####  ##### In Donna Ranieri et al. v. Banco Santander S.A. et al., the bank filed a motion to compel individualized arbitration and to dismiss the lawsuit based on agreements the mortgage loan officers had signed. ####  ##### The bank argued that the employees were obligated to arbitrate the issues under an employment letter and mortgage development officer agreement the employees were required to sign. ####  ##### The signatures, though, were directly under a boldfaced sentence that said, “I certify, by my signature below, that I have received a copy of the mortgage sales commission plan, which has been provided to me.” ####  ##### But the employees' signature alone did not necessarily bind them to the agreements, U.S. District Court Judge Madeline Cox Arleo ruled last week in a Newark, New Jersey, hearing. ####  ##### “Typically, a party's signature on an agreement objectively manifests assent to agree to the entire contract,” the judge ruled. “But the (mortgage development officer) agreement's ambiguous language makes this case atypical because the purpose of the signature can be construed in more than one way.” ####  ##### Pointing out the signature was just above the line referring to the commission plan, the judge said: “On one hand, plaintiffs' signatures could memorialize only that they received the plan; on the other hand, the signatures could represent their assent to agree to the terms of the (mortgage development officer) agreement, as well as confirmation that they received the plan. ####  ##### “Defendants do not cite to, nor is the court aware of, any cases where a signature served to bind a party under such ambiguous circumstances,” the judge ruled in rejecting the bank's bid to have the claims arbitrated individually and returning the case for additional action. ####  ##### Reacting to the ruling, Harris S. Freier, a partner at law firm Genova Burns L.L.C. in Newark, it is significant “because federal courts have recently been very pro-arbitration and have been mandated to be so by the Supreme Court.” ####  ##### Mr. Freier said the rulings include the Supreme Court's December 2015 decision in DirecTV Inc. v. Amy Imburgia et al., in which the high court held that a California state court's refusal to enforce an arbitration clause in a contract between El Segundo, California-based DirecTV and its customers conflicted with the Federal Arbitration Act. ####  ##### “It is very rare” for a federal court to rule an arbitration clause in an employment agreement is invalid, although there has been some “pushback” in state courts, Mr. Freier said. On the other hand, the National Labor Relations Board has issued rulings that contend these agreements are an unfair labor practice because they prevent employees from engaging in concerted activity. ####  ##### “One of the ways employers have tried to get around the NLRB's rulings is to be very careful with the language” of their arbitration  clauses. This ruling will encourage them to be even more careful, “with a particular focus on what's right above the signature line,” he said. #### "
"Q&A: Cindy Steele, RIMS San Diego Chapter";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### Cindy Steele is the president of the San Diego Chapter of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. and director of risk management for San Diego-based ConAm Management Corp., which provides property management services in the United States. Ms. Steele spoke recently with Business Insurance Staff Reporter Donna Mahoney about the risks and opportunities specific to the Southern California area. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: What are some of the risks that are unique to companies in the San Diego area? ####  ##### A: We have a lot of tourism traffic; visitors are drawn here for SeaWorld or Legoland. There are also many people coming here for conferences. This makes risk managers concerned about the issues that tourism brings to a community such as the threat of pandemics. San Diego has the busiest single-runway airport (over 20 million passengers last year) and the fourth-largest port in California; both cruise ships and air traffic play a large role in creating the transient traffic, which heightens the exposure of a pandemic on the community and impacting the business profile. The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services ranks the threat of pandemics as one of the top risks for San Diego. ####  ##### Q: What role is the San Diego RIMS chapter playing in this year's RIMS conference? ####  ##### A: This year, our chapter vetted some of the RIMS speakers from our region. There were a lot of speakers who came through our chapter who were interested in speaking. We are also the recipient of a chapter achievement award at the conference in acknowledgment of the planning that we do for our chapter throughout the year. We are also hosting a small reception at the conference to welcome the workers that helped put the conference together. We don't have a large role, but we will make sure that the conference team has all the resources it will need. We also helped organized an after-the-conference airport tour for attendees of the conference, who will get a tour behind the scenes of the San Diego airport. We are expecting about 50 people at that tour. ####  ##### Q: Is there anything that the San Diego RIMS chapter does that you think is unique? ####  ##### A: The military is very prominent here, and we love that fact. We just got a brand new combat ship, the USS Coronado, that will be making San Diego its new home. The chapter supports the United Services Organizations. We have the largest USO in the country; it is a dedicated facility that makes the traveling needs of the armed forces a little easier and gives them a place to go.Our RIMS chapter supports the Waves of Appreciation organization that every year gives the chapter members the opportunity to say thank you to the men and women of the military on their way home or to a deployment.Chapter members have the opportunity to volunteer twice a year to this effort, first to assemble thousands of bags full of snacks for traveling servicemen and -women who often can't afford to pay the costly prices of airport food, secondly to distribute the bags that were packed previously. Last year, we helped to distribute about 3,000 backpacks full of snacks to soldiers at Christmas time. There are other businesses that do this with us as well — it's not just us — it's many businesses and organizations from the community that join in. #### "
"Goodell Award winner not content to rest on his laurels";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### Though he received what's considered a lifetime achievement award, Christopher E. Mandel, a former Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. president, told an audience of several hundred who stood to applaud his success that he's “far from done” in the industry. ####  ##### “We're going to keep going,” he said Monday after receiving the Harry and Dorothy Goodell Award at RIMS' annual awards luncheon at its conference in San Diego. ####  ##### The award, named for RIMS' first president, honors individuals who have furthered the goal of the society and the risk management discipline and is considered the organization's top honor. ####  ##### Mr. Mandel, Nashville, Tennessee-based senior vice president of strategic solutions for Sedgwick Claims Management Inc. and Business Insurance's 2004 Risk Manager of the Year®, told the group he was humbled by the award and went on to thank those who he said helped him. ####  ##### He also bestowed words of wisdom to the group: “Be willing to take risks. You can't achieve without that. (And) always do the right thing.” ####  ##### He was one of nearly a dozen professionals honored at the awards luncheon. ####  ##### RIMS President Julie Pemberton helped present the awards. ####  ##### “Their contributions have advanced our society and industry,” she told attendees. “They are examples of what can be accomplished when you go beyond.” ####  ##### The Ron Judd Heart of RIMS Award, which honors individuals who keep their chapters vibrant and relevant, was given to Robin Joines, senior vice president of risk management for Sedgwick and an active member of RIMS' Memphis Chapter. ####  ##### The Cristy Award, which acknowledges the person who receives the highest marks on the three exams required for the Associate of Risk Management designation, was presented to David Engel, director of risk management for AT&T Inc. ####  ##### New this year, the RIMS Ambassadors Group award recognizes individuals for their continued service with RIMS, going above and beyond to help strengthen and support the society's strategic initiatives. Its first inductees are Darius Delon, South Alberta Chapter member and associate vice president of risk services at Mount Royal University, and Daniel McGarvey, Western Carolina Chapter member and managing director at Marsh L.L.C. ####  ##### The RIMS Rising Star Award, which honors risk management professionals younger than 35 or who have seven or fewer years of professional experience in the industry, was given to Alumine Bellone, director of risk and insurance for Broward Health, and Kathleen Crowe, account specialist for Aon Risk Solutions, both honored for exceptional initiative, volunteerism, professional development, achievement and leadership potential. #### "
"Transgender issues test organizations' adaptability";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management";" ##### The “bathroom issue” is becoming a major one with respect to transgender employees, said a speaker at a session on developing a strategy for transgender employees at the Risk & Insurance Management Society's Inc.'s annual conference Monday in San Diego. ####  ##### In North Carolina, “when I go through the airport, I'm supposed to use the men's room. That ain't going to happen, and it's a problem,” said Victoria E. Nolan, risk and benefits manager at Hillsboro, Oregon-based Clean Water Services, who underwent the transition to a transgender female in 2011. She was referring to recent legislation approved in North Carolina that bars transgenders from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their birth gender. ####  ##### During the session, Ms. Nolan and Liani J. Reeves, an attorney at Bullard Law in Portland, Oregon, discussed how this and other issues applied to the workplace. Among the suggestions offered was the use of gender-neutral restrooms. ####  ##### Ms. Reeves discussed how the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Justice and Occupational Safety and Health Administration have all issued policies banning discrimination against transgender individuals.Signs of possible discrimination, she said, include refusing to use a preferred name or revise records to accommodate the new name, and requiring use of single-sex restroom facilities. ####  ##### “The key here is are you treating a transgender employee differently?” she said. ####  ##### Employers should review their policies to be sure there is nothing ambiguous or confusing, said Ms. Reeves. ####  ##### Employers should be prepared for this issue, said Ms. Nolan. “The time to have the conversation is before your first transgender employee arrives,” she said. ####  ##### Ms. Nolan said some of the issues employers should address include changing the person's name, coverage under health plans, communications within the organization, security clearances in dealing with matters such as budgets, restroom and dressing room use, appearance rules, dress code rules, expectations of employee conduct, manager and employee training and notifying and communicating with clients and customers. ####  ##### Ms. Nolan said having the first transgender in the workplace can make some employees very uncomfortable.“What I did was say I'd use restrooms further away” that were hardly ever used, while fellow workers became used to the situation, she said. “It only took a couple of weeks.” ####  ##### Ms. Reeves said obtaining senior management support is crucial. The CEO, she said, “sets the tone of the organization. If your senior management can send a strong message of support … that is going to be key.” Direct supervisors, however, also “need to be on board.” #### "
"Risk management hinges on perspectives and observations";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### Having the right perspective, collaborating with the right partners and being able to pick up on telltale signs of deception are critical tools for risk managers. ####  ##### The opening general session at the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc.'s conference in San Diego Monday featured three keynote speakers delivering TED-style motivational speeches on these topics. It was a departure from the traditional single speaker format at a conference that usually marks the beginning of the formal program. The conference had kicked off with an opening reception on Sunday in the Gaslamp district, which was marked by a fireworks mishap. ####  ##### Vinh Giang, magician and motivational speaker, demonstrated how to perform a successful magic trick by changing the perspective of the audience and discussed collaborating with his partners to launch the Encyclopedia of Magic, an online program that instructs 65,000 students all over the world. ####  ##### “Magic is just a problem you can't solve,” he said. “Perspective is power, and collaboration is power. There is not one problem you cannot solve if you find the right perspective. Seek each other's perspective.” ####  ##### Scott Klososky, entrepreneur, author and consultant, introduced RIMS attendees to the world of 3-D printing, instructing them on the unique language involved such as the formal term “additive manufacturing,” which refers to the use of 3-D printing to manufacture objects from a digital file. He predicted that consumer-level 3-D printing of products such as toothbrushes will be coming soon thanks to technological advancements. ####  ##### “Twenty, 30 years from now, Amazon will seem like the Dark Ages,” Mr. Klososky said. But he noted that these advancements also introduce a new element of risk. “When we start experimenting with things we've never done before … that's where we learn hard lessons, that's where the risks come in,” Mr. Klososky said, citing the loss of intellectual property and product performance as key risks in the 3-D printing sphere. ####  ##### A key risk is the potential for a company to be put at a competitive disadvantage if a competitor embraces the technology first, he said. ####  ##### “You don't have a choice,” he said. “In some parts of the economy, you've got to learn how to do additive manufacturing. If you're too slow, you will lose market share.” ####  ##### Even developments in seemingly unrelated areas have potential implications for 3-D printing, he said. For example, self-driving cars, designed to prevent accidents, have increased the emphasis on the use of 3-D printing to create organs for transplant purposes, Mr. Klososky said. ####  ##### “Do you know what the organ donor people are scared to death of?” he said. “The No. 1 source of donated organs is car accidents. They get 75% of donor organs from car accidents. If you take away all the car accidents, there won't be donor organs anymore.” ####  ##### Pamela Meyer, entrepreneur, fraud examiner and author, discussed “liespotting” — the ability to see and understand clues that a person is lying, such as verbal dodges that include distancing language, specific denials and inappropriate tenses. ####  ##### “It's about knowing when there are red flags and when to drill down and ask harder questions,” she said. ####  ##### If risk managers suspect a person is being deceptive, they should ask themselves this question: “did they just go into convince mode?” Ms. Meyer said. ####  ##### “Step back,” she said. “Have they suddenly gone from being on your side and cooperating with you and providing you with information to all of a sudden try to convince. When they do that, what you want to do is let it rip. Let someone talk.” ####  ##### The fireworks malfunction occurred at about 7 p.m. Pacific Time at the RIMS' Meet 'n the Street outdoor event, which closed a block in San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter neighborhood so RIMS attendees could mingle in the street and restaurants. The fireworks display sent sparks into the crowd and smoke billowing through the street. ####  ##### A few injuries were reported though the extent was unclear, with many attendees taking cover in the restaurants on the block. ####  ##### Spokespeople for the San Diego fire and police departments could not be immediately reached for comment. RIMS officials were not available for comment Monday. #### "

"Keeping a grip on cyber risk, regulation increasingly challenging";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Forecasting critical risks is becoming increasingly more difficult, according to the 13th annual “Excellence in Risk Management” report released Monday by Marsh L.L.C. and the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. ####  ##### When asked how difficult forecasting critical risks is compared to three years ago, 32% of respondents in “Emerging Risks: Anticipating Threats and Opportunities Around the Corner” said it was more difficult, and 4% said that it was significantly more difficult, while 36% said it was the same, 26% said it was easier and 2% said it was significantly easier. ####  ##### But when asked whether predicting critical risks would be easier or more difficult three years from now, 40% said it would be more difficult, 8% said it would be significantly more difficult, while only 26% said it would be the same, 21% said it would be easier and 5% said it would be significantly easier. ####  ##### When asked which areas from which they thought the next critical risks for their organization would emerge, 61% of the respondents said cyber attacks, 58% said regulation and 40% said talent availability. When asked in what time frame the next critical risks would impact their organizations, 79% said that cyber attacks were already a significant concern. 71% said regulations already presented a significant concern and 53% said talent availability was already a significant concern. ####  ##### Growing interconnectedness “creates an environment where keeping up with evolving issues becomes more difficult,” the report said. ####  ##### “Therefore success in risk management now often comes to organizations that develop a multidimensional approach to identifying and managing complex risks. These organizations are able to not only see the risk around the corner but to understand that it may interact in not-so-predictable ways with existing risks.” ####  ##### The report is based on more than 700 responses to an online survey and a series of focus groups with leading risk executives conducted by Marsh and RIMS in January and February of this year. #### "

These are core to RIMS' mission, and experiencing it at the conference is energizing. These are my goals as it relates to my organization as well. Having the opportunity to engage my professional network of risk managers, underwriters, brokers and other vendors is invaluable. ####  ##### Q: What do you hope that the 200-plus students attending the conference will learn about the risk management discipline? ####  ##### A: I hope they will experience just how passionate our members are about risk management — and that you can have fun in your career. I also hope they learn the value of networking. I always encourage students to collect as many business cards as possible and engage those they meet on LinkedIn after the conference. Most risk leaders I know are more than willing to mentor and share experiences with students and Rising Risk Professionals. ####  ##### Q: What advice would you offer first-time attendees of the RIMS conference? ####  ##### A: Try not to get too overwhelmed. There is so much to see, do, learn and experience. While there's no way you can do it all, try to take advantage of all the conference has to offer. Attending the first-timers' orientation will also help you navigate the conference. ####  ##### Q: Finish this sentence: I will consider RIMS 2016 to be a success if… ####  ##### A: I go home tired! It will mean I've experienced much. #### "

"EEOC can subpoena employer of undocumented worker ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the authority to subpoena an employer in a discrimination complaint filed by an undocumented worker, despite the unanswered question of whether the agency ultimately has jurisdiction in the case, says an appeals court in reversing a lower court ruling. ####  ##### Elmer Escalante, an undocumented worker who was hired as a vacuumer at an Edgewater, Maryland carwash operated by Millersville, Maryland-based Maritime Autowash Inc. in May, 2012, filed a complaint against his employer with the EEOC in February 2014, charging discrimination on the basis of national origin and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in connection with its treatment of Hispanics, according to Monday’s ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Maritime Autowash Inc. ####  ##### The EEOC issued a subpoena in the case, then sought the approval of the U.S. District Court in Baltimore to enforce it when Maritime did not respond. The District Court held that because Mr. Escalante was an undocumented worker, he did not have standing to sue Maritime, and “thus left no viable basis for his EEOC complaint,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The trial court erred in refusing to authorize this “very preliminary step,” said a unanimous three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit. ####  ##### “Courts may uphold the agency’s subpoena authority without the need to pass on its view of Title VII’s coverage of undocumented workers,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The EEOC’s investigation of Mr. Escalante’s charges is “at least plausibly and arguably related to the authority that Congress conferred upon the commission,” said the ruling. “This is not a case where the agency went rogue or jumped the tracks and sought to investigate something unrelated to its statutory charge.” ####  ##### “The particular issue that Maritime presses — whether and to what extent Title VII covers undocumented aliens — is a novel and complex problem especially ill-suited to a premature and absolute pronouncement,” said the court, in remanding the case with instructions that the EEOC’s subpoena be enforced. #### "

"Reading of the Riot Act limits Sony claims in U.K.";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers, United Kingdom, General liability";" ##### Property owners and their insurers cannot claim compensation for consequential loss under the U.K.'s Riot Act, according to a recent court ruling. ####  ##### A decision by the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom's highest court, last week overturned a landmark appeal court decision that allowed Sony DADC, a Salzburg, Austria-based unit of Sony Corp., and its insurers to recover compensation from the police for consequential losses after a Sony distribution center was damaged during riots in London in 2011. ####  ##### In the case of The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime v. Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. (Europe) Ltd. & others, the Supreme Court ruled that consequential losses — such as loss of profit and loss of rental income — suffered by Sony, the freehold owner of a warehouse, and customers whose stock was destroyed are not covered by the U.K. Riot (Damages) Act 1886. ####  ##### The case concerns an incident on Aug. 8, 2011, amid a spate of riots that swept London and other areas of the United Kingdom after a controversial police shooting. ####  ##### A gang of youths broke into the Sony distribution center in Enfield, London, and stole goods and started a fire which destroyed a warehouse, stock and equipment. ####  ##### In May 2014, the Court of Appeal in London ruled that Sony's insurers could recover consequential losses from the police under the act. ####  ##### In the wake of that decision, and the large number of claims received after the 2011 riots, the government drafted an updated version of the act, the Riot Compensation Bill, which currently is being considered by Parliament. ####  ##### In its decision published Wednesday, the Supreme Court said it did not believe the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 was intended to extend compensation beyond physical damage to property. ####  ##### Chris Owen, head of disputes at Bristol, England-based law firm TLT L.L.P., which represented The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime — the Metropolitan Police — said that many claims for consequential loss were dependant on the outcome of the case. ####  ##### “The law was unclear in this area and largely written for a different era,” he said in a statement. ####  ##### “The Supreme Court ruling (…) has clarified that the compensation payable by the Metropolitan Police is limited to the costs of repairing the damage done to property during the 2011 London riots,” he said. ####  ##### “The Supreme Court judgment delivered by Lord Hodge in this case means that MSIEu will not be entitled to recover our outlay in respect of the consequential loss claim,” said a spokesman for Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Europe. ####  ##### “While disappointing, given the broader context of the substantial recovery already made regarding the material damage, overall this has been a successful outcome for MSIEu,” he added. #### "
"Facts drove award in lesbian firefighter's bias case but precedent far from clear";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### The jury weighed the facts, according to labor law experts, and awarded $800,000 to a lesbian former firefighter in Providence, Rhode Island, in a sexual orientation bias suit, in line with typical seven-figure awards in discrimination cases. ####  ##### But, far from a slam-dunk, it took four years to bring the suit to trial and appeals are pending, the experts point out, which sends a less clear message to workers in similar situations. ####  ##### Former firefighter Lori Franchina sued in U.S. District Court in Providence in 2012 alleging “intense, constant and prolific mistreatment” because she is a lesbian, resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court records. ####  ##### Ms. Franchina, who joined the fire department in 2002, alleged she was subjected to years of insults about her sexual orientation, given an obscene-sounding nickname, faced insubordination and disrespect and was physically assaulted by another firefighter. She alleged the harassment endangered her safety and that of victims she was helping, but her repeated complaints were ignored. ####  ##### Last week, she was  awarded more than $800,000 in damages by a federal jury for gender, sexual orientation and disability discrimination, as well as retaliation she suffered from male colleagues and city and union officials who failed to respond to her complaint. ####  ##### “The facts drive these cases,” said Gerald L. Maatman Jr., a partner at Seyfarth Shaw L.L.P. in Chicago, “and here was a situation where the jury thought that facts in front of them demonstrated that a person's rights were violated. Most risk managers, most (human resources) professionals working in America these days recognize that and have extensive policies and practices prohibiting discrimination and indicating to employees that if they have a problem to let HR know so the issue can be investigated and remediated where necessary.” ####  ##### A spokeswoman for the Providence Mayor's Office said in an email that the city intends to appeal the ruling, adding that it “remains committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination.” ####  ##### Marcia McCormick, director of the William C. Wefel Center for Employment Law, at the St. Louis University School of Law, said in an email that she does not believe “the verdict shows any major changes in workplace lawsuits.” ####  ##### “This case was simply the application of clear law to a pretty terrible situation,” Ms. McCormick wrote. “It may show others in similar situations that winning a discrimination case is possible, but considering that this case took four years to reach a verdict, and the department plans to appeal, which will add at least another year delay and could change the outcome, that message may not be very strong.” ####  ##### Neither Mr. Maatman nor Ms. McCormick expressed surprise at the size of the award. ####  ##### “Employment discrimination tends in certain situations to spike to seven figure awards,” Mr. Maatman said. “The facts of the case generally drive the results in terms of sizes of verdicts.” #### "

"Uber drivers remain independent contractors as lawsuit settles";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Uber Technologies Inc. has agreed to pay up to $100 million to settle a class action lawsuit that resolves a major challenge to its business model by allowing the ride-hailing service to keep its California and Massachusetts drivers as independent contractors. ####  ##### The lawsuit had claimed that Uber drivers are employees and thus entitled to reimbursement of expenses. ####  ##### The case against Uber had been closely watched in Silicon Valley, as other companies in the on-demand tech economy share Uber's reliance on independent contractors. The class action had been scheduled for a trial in San Francisco federal court in June. ####  ##### ""We realize that some will be disappointed not to see this case go to trial,"" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for drivers. ####  ##### However, Ms. Liss-Riordan said the plaintiff drivers faced significant risks of losing if the case moved forward, particularly because a federal appeals court had recently agreed to review an order allowing Uber drivers to sue as a group. ####  ##### Nothing about the settlement prevents a future court, or U.S. labor authorities, from deeming Uber drivers as employees, she said in a statement. ####  ##### Driver deactivation ####  ##### Out of the $100 million proposed payment, $84 million is guaranteed to drivers. Uber could also pay an additional $16 million, but only if the company's valuation grows by 150% above its December 2015 financing round within a year after any initial public offering. ####  ##### Uber was valued at $62.5 billion in that December funding round. ####  ##### Uber agreed to some changes in its business practices, including the institution of a policy for deactivation of drivers, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in a blog post about the settlement. Some drivers had long complained that Uber arbitrarily terminated users from its platform. ####  ##### Uber is ""pleased"" that the deal ""recognizes that drivers should remain as independent contractors, not employees,"" Mr. Kalanick said in the post. ####  ##### The company also agreed to help create a drivers' association in both states. Ms. Liss-Riordan said that while such groups are not officially a union, they can act like a union in bringing grievances to management's attention. ####  ##### The settlement is similar to a separate agreement announced with Lyft Inc. drivers earlier this year, though the Uber agreement is much larger given that Uber has many more drivers. ####  ##### Over 450,000 U.S. drivers currently use the app each month, Mr. Kalanick said in the blog post. ####  ##### The Uber deal must be approved by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco. #### "

"Court sides with policyholders in complex litigation over asbestos claims ";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, Liberty Mutual, Claims Disputes, General liability";" ##### Policyholders scored a victory from New York's highest court, which has ruled in an asbestos case that the “all sums” method should be used to determine how much insurers owe them for their coverage. ####  ##### The unanimous Monday ruling also holds that policyholders can access their excess coverage after exhausting their underlying coverage by a method they favor. ####  ##### The Delaware Supreme Court asked the New York Court of Appeals to address the issue in the complex insurance dispute. ####  ##### The case stemmed from Cedar Falls, Iowa-based Viking Pump Inc. and Warren, Michigan-based Warren Pumps L.L.C. acquiring pump manufacturing businesses from Northbrook, Illinois-based Houdaille Industries Inc. in the 1980s, according to In the Matter of Viking Pump Inc. and Warren Pumps L.L.C. Insurance Appeals. ####  ##### The acquisitions later subjected Viking and Warren to significant potential liability in connection with asbestos exposure claims, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Houdaille had extensive multilayer insurance coverage from 1972 to 1985 that included coverage for these claims, according to the ruling. ####  ##### This included primary coverage totaling about $17.5 million with Boston-based Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. through successive annual polices, as well as additional layers of excess insurance through annual policies issued by various insurers totaling more than $400 million, including defendant insurers in the case. ####  ##### As the Liberty Mutual coverage neared exhaustion, litigation arose as to whether Viking and Warren were entitled to coverage under the additional excess policies that were issued by other insurers, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Eventually, the case reached the Delaware Supreme Court, which asked the New York court in 2015 to determine which allocation method should be used under New York law. ####  ##### Allocation methods ####  ##### Two basic types of allocation approaches are used in long-tail claims, including those in asbestos cases: the “all sums” and the “pro rata” methods. ####  ##### Under the all-sums approach, favored by policyholders, they can collect under any policy that is in effect during the period that the damage occurred up to the limits of that policy, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Experts say the all-sums approach means policyholders are not limited to a single year to claim coverage. ####  ##### Under the pro-rata allocation that the excess insurers proposed, an insurer's liability would be limited to the amounts incurred by the insured during the policy period. ####  ##### Experts say the pro-rata approach limits insurers' payments to the fraction of property damage that occurred only during their policy period. ####  ##### Courts have ruled both ways on this issue, the New York Court of Appeals said in its ruling. The court concluded that based on policy language the “all sums allocation is appropriate” in this case. ####  ##### The court also ruled the “vertical exhaustion” of the insurance coverage is appropriate in this case rather than “horizontal exhaustion.” ####  ##### Under horizontal exhaustion, all triggered primary and umbrella excess layers must be exhausted before tapping excess insurance. ####  ##### Under vertical exhaustion, the policyholders can access each excess policy immediately once the underlying policies' limits are depleted, even if other lower-level policies during different policy periods remain unexhausted. ####  ##### “In our view, vertical exhaustion is more consistent than horizontal exhaustion” under the policy language, the court ruled in siding with policyholders. #### "
"Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $55 million in talc-powder trial";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, D&O, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Johnson & Johnson was ordered by a U.S. jury on Monday to pay $55 million to a woman who said that using the company's talc-powder products for feminine hygiene caused her to develop ovarian cancer. ####  ##### The verdict, which J&J plans to appeal, was the second straight trial loss for the company, which is facing about 1,200 lawsuits accusing it of not adequately warning consumers about its talc-based products' cancer risks. ####  ##### Following a three-week trial in Missouri state court, jurors deliberated for about a day before returning a verdict for Gloria Ristesund. She was awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages. ####  ##### A J&J spokeswoman said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc. The company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety, she said. ####  ##### Ms. Ristesund said she used J&J's talc-based powder products — which include the well-known Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder — on her genitals for decades. According to her lawyers, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a hysterectomy and related surgeries. Her cancer is now in remission. ####  ##### Jere Beasley, whose firm represents Ms. Ristesund, said his client was gratified with the verdict. The jury's decision should “end the litigation” and compel J&J to settle the remaining cases, he said. ####  ##### The verdict followed a $72 million jury award from the same court in February to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene. ####  ##### That verdict, which J&J is appealing, sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits among plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as consumers familiar with J&J's powder products. But scientists have told Reuters the evidence of a real danger is inconclusive. ####  ##### Plaintiffs in talc litigation, which is concentrated in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, have accused J&J of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer. J&J has said it acted properly in developing and marketing the products. ####  ##### The only other case to be tried involving talc powder and ovarian cancer resulted in a mixed verdict in South Dakota federal court in 2013. While those jurors found J&J was negligent, they awarded no damages to the plaintiff, whose cancer was in remission at the time of the trial. #### "
"Video privacy suit over USA Today mobile app reinstated";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, General liability, Technology";" ##### A federal appeals court has reinstated putative class action litigation filed by a plaintiff who charged that a Gannett Inc. unit allegedly violated the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 by passing on personal information to a marketing firm. ####  ##### Gannett Satellite Information Network Inc. a unit of McLean, Virginia-based Gannett Inc., which publishes USA Today, also offers a proprietary software application “USA Today Mobile App” that allows users to access the newspaper's content, including video, on mobile devices, according to last week's ruling by the 1st U.S. District Court of Appeals in Boston in Alexander Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc., d/b/a/ USA Today. ####  ##### Each time the user views a video on the app, Gannet sends to San Jose, California-based Adobe Systems Inc., a software company that provides data analytics and online marketing services to its clients, the title of the video viewed, the GPS coordinates of the device at the time it was viewed and certain identifiers associated with the user's device, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Adobe takes this and other information it culls from a variety of sources to create profiles that may include  the user's name and address, age and income, “household structure” and online navigation and transaction history. ####  ##### Mr. Yershov downloaded and installed the app on his Android mobile device in late 2013. “At no time did he consent, agree or otherwise permit Gannett to disclose any information about him to third parties, nor did Gannett provide him with the opportunity to prevent such disclosures,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### “Nevertheless, each time Yershov watched a video clip on the app, Gannett disclosed to Adobe the title of the viewed video, Yershov's unique Android ID and the GPS coordinates of Yershov's device at the time the video was viewed,” said the April 29 ruling. ####  ##### Mr. Yershov sued Gannett in U.S. District Court in Boston, charging violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988. The lower court found that while the information Gannett disclosed concerning Mr. Yershov was “personally identifiable information” under the act, he was not a “renter, purchaser or subscriber” to Gannett's video content and was therefore not protected under the act. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the appeals court, which included retired associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter, unanimously overturned the ruling, and held Mr. Yershov could be considered a subscriber under the act. ####  ##### Mr. Yershov “plausibly pleads a case that the (act's) prohibition on disclosure applies,” said the ruling. The facts Mr. Yershov alleges “together with reasonable inferences drawn from those facts, plausibly describe a relationship between Yershov and Gannett, combined with a disclosure by Gannett, that ran afoul,” of the act, said the appeals court, in reversing the lower court ruling and remanding it for further proceedings. ####  ##### In 2015, Google Inc. and Viacom Inc. won the  dismissal of a nationwide privacy lawsuit filed under the Video Privacy Protection Act that accused them of illegally tracking the Internet activity of boys and girls who visited the website of cable TV channel Nickelodeon to send them targeted advertising. #### "

"U.K. banks ordered to review cyber security after SWIFT heist";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Middle East/Africa, United Kingdom, Emerging Risks, Technology";" ##### (Reuters) — The Bank of England ordered U.K. banks to detail steps taken to secure computers connected to the SWIFT bank messaging network about two months after a still-unidentified group used the system to steal $81 million from Bank Bangladesh, according to three people familiar with the effort. ####  ##### The central bank sent the request to update cyber security measures to all banks it regulates in mid-to-late April, according to these people, who were not authorized to discuss the confidential communications. ####  ##### The previously unreported action marks the earliest known case of a central bank in a major economy to order its member banks to conduct a formal security review in response to the Bangladesh theft, which has shaken the global system for transferring money among both commercial and central banks. ####  ##### The Bank of England, one of the G10 central banks that oversee Brussels-based SWIFT, said it had no immediate comment. ####  ##### The FBI, authorities in Dhaka and private forensic experts are investigating the February cyber heist in Bangladesh where thieves raided a central bank account kept at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stealing $81 million. They installed malware inside the bank’s Dhaka headquarters that hid traces of their attack in a bid to delay discovery so they could access the funds, according to police and private security firms. ####  ##### The Bank of England told banks to conduct a “compliance check” to confirm whether they are following security practices recommended by SWIFT, which the firm recently reissued to members in the wake of the February heist, one of the people said. ####  ##### SWIFT declined to comment. The group has previously declined to release those guidelines, which were issued in private communications. ####  ##### The checks called for by the Bank of England include conducting what are known as user entitlement reviews, which ensure that only authorized staff have access to SWIFT applications and the service’s messaging gateway, that person said. ####  ##### Banks were also told to review computer logs for digital evidence known as “indicators of compromise,” including IP addresses and email addresses linked to recent attacks. ####  ##### Those indicators include technical details included in reports from several private cyber security firms, including Britain’s BAE Systems P.L.C. ####  ##### The communication from the Bank of England asked banks to respond by early May and provide details about plans for installing a security update to SWIFT Alliance Access software, according to the person. The messaging group last month released the update and asked members to install by May 16 ####  ##### Meanwhile, Sweden’s Riksbank on Wednesday called on all users of the central bank’s RIX payments system for large transaction to follow the SWIFT recommendations, a central bank spokesman told Reuters. ####  ##### Earlier this week, Singapore’s central bank asked banks to maintain a high level of security for their critical IT systems following recent cyber attacks using the SWIFT financial messaging system. ####  ##### In the Philippines, a senior central bank official said on Tuesday that regulators were crafting regulations to help banks and other financial institutions fend off cyber heists and minimize damage after any systems breach. #### "
"More football concussion lawsuits filed against NCAA";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, General liability";" ##### A Houston-based law firm said Wednesday it had filed six concussion claims against the NCAA and several Division I universities and athletic conferences. ####  ##### Raizner Slania L.L.P. said in a statement Wednesday that it had filed the lawsuits in various courts around the country seeking compensation on behalf of classes of former athletes from Penn State University, Auburn University, the University of Oregon, University of Georgia, University of Utah, and Vanderbilt University. ####  ##### Chicago attorney Jay Edelson of Edelson P.C., who is leading this latest effort to sue the NCAA, said 40 to 50 class-action lawsuits will eventually get filed on behalf of tens of thousands of ex-football players, according to media reports. ####  ##### A complaint was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. The filing lists Raizner, Mr. Edelson and three other attorneys as representing lawsuit plaintiffs. ####  ##### The plaintiffs charge that the defendants, including the NCAA, Penn State, the PAC-12 Conference, the Southeastern Conference, Vanderbilt University, and the Western Athletic Conference, breached their duties to student-athletes by concealing the dangers of concussions and failing to implement appropriate safety protocols. ####  ##### The filed complaint charges that until 2010, the NCAA and the SEC “kept their players and the public in the dark about an epidemic that was slowly killing their athletes.” ####  ##### “Over time,” the complaint said, “the repetitive and violent impacts to players' heads led to repeated concussions that severely increased their risks of long term brain injuries, including memory loss, dementia, depression, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ('CTE'), Parkinson's disease, and other related symptoms. Meaning, long after they played their last game, they are left with a series of neurological events that could slowly strangle and choke their brains.” ####  ##### The plaintiff in this particular case, Joseph Miller, played football from 1996 to 1998 at Auburn as a linebacker. ####  ##### “During hitting drills and regular practice scrimmages,” the complaint said, “Miller would hit so hard that he would see stars or black out, lose balance, and try to shake it off. These incidents happened two to three times per week during football practice and football season. Miller graduated from Auburn in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Over time, Miller began to experience the consequences of these blows. He began to lose memory and struggle with depression, anxiety and other diagnosed disorders.” ####  ##### Mr. Miller, the complaint said, “now suffers from deficits in cognitive functioning, reduced processing speed, decline in attention and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, and mood swings, among other issues.” ####  ##### The plaintiffs charge that the NCAA and the other defendants ignored the medical risks to college football players; aggravated and enhanced medical risks to college football players; failed to educate college football players about the link between traumatic brain injuries in amateur football and chronic neurological damage, illnesses, and decline; failed to implement or enforce any system that would reasonably have mitigated, prevented, or addressed these injuries that college football players suffered; and failed to timely implement “return to play” guidelines for student-athletes who sustain concussions. ####  ##### Even when defendants began to make changes, the law firm said, their policies remained flawed, “to the lifelong detriment of thousands of 18 to 22 year olds.” These deficient policies were implemented far too late for the putative class of college football players, the firm said, who suffered reasonably foreseeable harm as a result of the NCAA's actions, and those of its member institutions and conferences. ####  ##### “While (the lawsuit) is a major step for collegiate athletes who have been forced to deal with the lifelong impacts of concussions, we remain disappointed that the NCAA has at every turn sought to avoid accountability toward generations of players who entrusted their well-being to this organization,” Jeff Raizner, partner at Raizner Slania, said in a statement. “We fully expect to file a number of additional lawsuits in the coming weeks and months.” ####  ##### The NCAA did not respond to an email seeking comment by the time this story was posted. The NCAA is finalizing a $75 million settlement from a different lawsuit related to concussions. ####  ##### Last month a federal appeals court approved a class action settlement that may cost the National Football League $1 billion. The settlement, which is expected to cover more than 20,000 retired football players over the course of 65 years, releases all concussion-related claims against the NFL, according to the ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. #### "

"N.Y. brokers must pay $1.9 million for insider trading";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Two former New York stockbrokers must pay $1.9 million for trading on confidential tips about an IBM Corp. acquisition, a federal judge ruled on Monday. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan ordered ex-Euro Pacific Capital Inc. brokers Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant to pay $546,458 and $1.34 million, respectively, after a federal jury found them liable in February on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges. ####  ##### Judge Rakoff ruled that a civil penalty was appropriate given the jury’s verdict. He rejected arguments by Mr. Durant that he should be forced to pay only $53,000, saying to accept his arguments would grant him “a significant undeserved windfall.” ####  ##### But Judge Rakoff declined to adopt even steeper penalties sought by the SEC, which asked to have Mr. Payton pay $1.03 million and Mr. Durant pay $2.57 million, citing their “challenging financial circumstances.” ####  ##### Lawyers for Messrs. Payton and Durant did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both men, who previously faced criminal charges only to have those dropped last year, are expected to appeal. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. ####  ##### The SEC alleged that in 2009, an attorney at IBM Corp.’s law firm told his friend, Royal Bank of Scotland Group P.L.C. analyst Trent Martin, that he was working on IBM’s $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. ####  ##### While the lawyer expected Mr. Martin not to tell anyone, Mr. Martin bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a Euro Pacific employee, the SEC said. ####  ##### Mr. Conradt then told four Euro Pacific colleagues, including Messrs. Payton and Durant, who made hundreds of thousands of dollars trading before the deal’s announcement, the SEC said. ####  ##### Federal prosecutors initially brought criminal charges over the case against five people, four of whom including Mr. Payton but not Mr. Durant pleaded guilty. ####  ##### But after a December 2014 appellate ruling limited the scope of U.S. insider trading laws, a federal judge threw out the guilty pleas and prosecutors dropped the case. The SEC, facing a lower burden of proof, chose to move forward in its case. #### "

"Zurich Insurance first-quarter profit down";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Zurich, Switzerland, Financial Results";" ##### Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. on Thursday reported net income after taxes of $926 million for the first quarter of 2016, down 27.1% from the year-ago period. ####  ##### The Swiss insurer posted total revenue of $13.83 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 39.6% from the first quarter of 2015. ####  ##### General insurance gross written premiums fell 9.8% to $9.12 billion from last year, largely due to re-underwriting and de-risking actions to improve performance that were announced last year, the company said in a statement. ####  ##### The general insurance segment reported net income before taxes of $611 million for the quarter, down 34.2% from a year ago, but an improvement over the last quarter's operating loss of $120 million. ####  ##### The combined ratio totaled 97.7% a slight increase from last year's 96.7%. Zurich's Farmers segment's net income before taxes was down 13.8% at $343 million as Farmers Re reported a loss due to significant catastrophe losses at the Farmers Exchanges, including more than $250 million in claims related to two hailstorms that struck the Dallas/Fort Worth area in March. ####  ##### Zurich Insurance cut 2015 pay for its top management by more than half after they failed to meet major performance targets, the company said in its annual report published in March. ####  ##### “While it is still early in the process, these results show that the measures we put in place to improve the performance of our General Insurance business are taking effect,” Chief Financial Officer George Quinn said in a statement. “Even adjusting for a benign catastrophe claims environment, there has been an underlying improvement, and we expect to see this trend continue throughout the year.” ####  ##### “What I can say today is that the group is fundamentally sound, reserves are adequate, capital is strong, and the brand is very strong,” said CEO Mario Greco, who took over in March, during a conference call with analysts. “That gives us a very firm foundation to build over the next months and years.” ####  ##### Mr. Greco added that the “results are a step in the right direction in that they provide the early evidence that the measures we started last year are improving the performance of general insurance.” #### "

He believes his company wanted him to quit voluntarily to limit severance payments he would have been entitled to, but he decided to stay on due to a sluggish economy. ####  ##### Despite earning a handsome salary for doing nothing, he described the four-year period as “hell” and “a nightmare” and said it caused multiple health issues, including ulcers and depression. He was ultimately fired after sustaining injuries from a car crash that forced him to go on seven-month sick leave, with his employer saying these absences interrupted work processes. ####  ##### Mr. Desnard believes the company should be held responsible for mental and other health damages and for his missing out on a promotion. A verdict in the case is expected July 27. ####  ##### However, a lawyer for Interparfum said there was no proof the company tried to bore him into quitting and accused Mr. Desnard of shifting gears to the boredom allegations after previously claiming to be suffering from burnout. ####  ##### If not for fragrance allergies, plenty of folks might have offered to switch jobs with Mr. Desnard. #### "

"Shipowner's piracy claim against war risk insurers dismissed ";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, European Union, Risk Management, China, United Kingdom, Claims Disputes, Marine";" ##### A judge in the High Court in London has thrown out a claim by a shipowner against a group of 10 war risk underwriters over the total constructive loss of a vessel that the owner claimed was boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden who then detonated a bomb on board. ####  ##### In the case of Suez Fortune Investments Ltd. & Piraeus Bank A.E. v Talbot Underwriting Ltd., Mr. Justice Julian Flaux ruled that reasons given by the shipowner for its refusal to hand over an electronic archive to lawyers were a “fabrication.” ####  ##### Even if the shipowner's story were true, the judge said, after the court had granted an extension to them for handing over the archive, he was “firmly of the view that there could not be a fair trial as between the owners and the insurers unless there was full and proper compliance by the owners with their disclosure obligations, including handing over the archive.” ####  ##### The case concerned the loss of the motor tanker Brillante Virtuoso, which was owned by Suez Investments and mortgaged by Piraeus Bank. ####  ##### The vessel suffered an explosion near its engine room while stopped in the Gulf of Aden on July 5, 2011. ####  ##### The owner claimed that the vessel was boarded by pirates who, when the vessel's engine, which had stopped, could not be restarted, detonated an explosive device in its purifier room. ####  ##### After a salvage effort, the ship was sold for scrap, and the owner instigated a claim against its war risk underwriters claiming the vessel was a total constructive loss. ####  ##### The underwriters resisted that claim, and court proceedings began in the commercial court in London in 2012. ####  ##### The parties agreed that the issue of quantum of claim should be tried before liability and, on Nov. 8, 2013, Mr. Justice Flaux ordered a split trial. ####  ##### In a judgment handed down on Jan. 15, 2015, Mr. Justice Flaux ruled that the vessel was a total constructive loss. ####  ##### The insurers contended that in the matter of liability for the loss, the shipowner was not entitled to claim under its policy because by delaying transit through the Gulf of Aden and/or calling at a port of place within the Gulf of Aden, it had breached Talbot's Gulf of Aden warranty, which stated that “when transiting, vessels/craft shall not call at any port or place or delay their passage in the transfer of cargo, stores, personnel or the like,” according to court papers. ####  ##### The insurers also claimed that the owner and manager of the vessel had breached the policy by failing to apply best practices to deter piracy. ####  ##### In March 2015, Norton Rose Fulbright L.L.P. in London, the law firm representing the insurers, served a defense and counterclaim to the owner and bank's lawyers, Hill Dickinson L.L.P. and Clyde & Co. L.L.P., alleging that the vessel had been lost “as a result of willful misconduct on the part of the owners,” the court papers show. ####  ##### In May 2015, the judge ordered the shipowner to disclose certain documents, which had been transferred to a USB flash drive, to the insurers' lawyers. ####  ##### The owners and their lawyers subsequently made several applications for an extension of the time needed for them to disclose the electronic archive held on that flash drive. ####  ##### A letter sent by Hill Dickinson in December 2015 set out the shipowner's reasons for its unwillingness to relinquish the flash drive, including that the drive contained information about an unrelated case, confidential information including telephone records and bank details about third parties, and information about the shipowner's health, among other things. ####  ##### The shipowner then applied for a further extension of time, until Feb. 29, 2016, contending that a lawyer for World Wide Worldwide Green Tankers Ltd., which previously had managed the vessel, would not hand over the flash drive for various reasons. ####  ##### In the meantime, the insurers alleged that the owner of the vessel had conspired with the charterers of the vessel to issue false bills of lading in order to deceive Chinese authorities into charging a lower import duty. ####  ##### A date for a hearing was set for March, but in a statement made on Feb. 2, the ship's ultimate owner, Marios Iliopoulos, claimed he could not travel to London from Greece for health reasons. ####  ##### He also was arrested by City of London Police for conspiracy to commit fraud — in an unrelated matter — and released on bail after several hours of questioning on April 12. ####  ##### The judge said in his Tuesday ruling that he had ignored those events in evaluating Mr. Iliopoulos' evidence in this case. ####  ##### Despite a claim by Hill Dickinson that the case could be heard without the electronic archive, on May 10 the judge threw the case out. #### "

"RIMS sounds alarm on latest OSHA injury-reporting rules ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Risk Management, Workers Comp Coverage, Disability";" ##### The new electronic recordkeeping rule issued by OSHA has drawn concern from the risk management community, the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. said Thursday. ####  ##### Inaccurate safety ratings, reporting redundancies and cyber exposures will result from the new rule on electronic record-keeping of workplace injuries released by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration that takes effect Jan. 1, 2017, the agency said in a statement. ####  ##### OSHA’s new rule requiring the publishing of employee injuries can increase litigation against an organization and can also be used against an organization by industry competitors, RIMS said in the release. ####  ##### The organization is also concerned about the ambiguity of the cause of a workplace injury potentially creating misconceptions about an organization’s workplace safety, the statement said. ####  ##### RIMS also listed OSHA’s web-based reporting application as an issue because of its additional cyber exposures. ####  ##### Because of the new rules, employers may also stop tracking minor incidents to lower incident rates, RIMS said in the statement. ####  ##### “Organizations practicing effective risk management track not only injuries resulting in loss of work, but also those injuries which may only require simply first aid treatment,” RIMS said in an official comment letter addressed to OSHA in 2014. “This practice allows an organization to track potential loss trends in order to avoid potentially larger issues. Should employers be required to publicly share this information, they would most likely stop trending these minor incidents in order to appear as if their incident rate is lower and more comparable to other companies,” the letter said. ####  ##### RIMS plans to continue to work with OSHA as it develops the final electronic reporting process, the statement said. #### "

"Battery bunny dispute re-energized";"Risk Management";"Off Beat";" ##### In the words of the marketing slogan, a trademark dispute between Energizer Holdings Inc. and Duracell Inc. over a pink bunny mascot “just keeps going and going.” ####  ##### According to Reuters, in the U.S. District Court in St. Louis last week, Judge Carol Jackson ruled that Duracell must face claims that its bunny mascot confuses customers and harms Energizer, which has used a bunny mascot on its packaging since 1989. ####  ##### Energizer's pink rabbit originally was a parody of a bunny used in Duracell advertisements. The Duracell bunny still is used in Europe and Australia but is not part of Duracell's branding in the United States. ####  ##### In 1992, Duracell and Energizer struck an agreement limiting Duracell's usage of the bunny in marketing in the United States and Canada. ####  ##### Duracell claimed that Energizer's lawsuit was a “thinly veiled” attempt to renegotiate that agreement, and said that it should not be liable if distributors of its batteries lawfully send bunny-branded packages to the United States. ####  ##### The judge, however, said that those assertions were not a proper basis for dismissing Energizer's suit. ####  ##### And so, much like the claims both manufacturers make about their batteries, there's still life in this dispute. #### "
"Zurich prevails in bid to deny business interruption coverage";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers, Zurich";" ##### Zurich American Insurance Co. is not obligated to pay $70 million in business interruption losses to a medical imaging firm in connection with the shutdown of a Canadian nuclear plant because of an exclusion in its all-risk property policy, a federal appeals court said Wednesday in affirming a lower court ruling. ####  ##### North Billerica, Massachusetts-based Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc., is a specialty pharmaceutical company that manufactures and distributes diagnostic medical imaging products, according to court papers in Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc. v. Zurich American Insurance Co. ####  ##### A key component in one of its products, the TechneLite Generator, is the molybdenum-99 isotope, which it indirectly obtains from the nuclear reactor at Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada, that is operated by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. ####  ##### Schaumburg, Illinois-based Zurich had issued an all-risk property insurance policy to Lantheus that was in effect from Jan. 8, 2009, through Jan. 8, 2010. ####  ##### The policy included coverage for “contingent business income loss,” including a $70 million sublimit in connection with the Chalk River reactor, according to court papers. Exclusions for losses not covered included one for corrosion. ####  ##### In May 2009, a breach led to the reactor's shutdown for 15 months. As a result, Lantheus had to cut back on production of it generators, and lost revenue and incurred extra expense in obtaining an alternate supply of Moly-99. ####  ##### Zurich denied the company's claim for coverage on the basis that the business interruption had occurred because of corrosion at the reactor, and therefore fell under its policy's exclusion. ####  ##### The company filed suit in U.S. District Court in New York, which ruled in Zurich's favor in April 2015. Lantheus appealed the ruling, and a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the lower court ruling. ####  ##### “The District Court's analysis is thorough and sound,” said the 2nd Circuit ruling. “There is no question of material fact” that the shutdown falls under the exclusion, “even accepting Lantheus' proposed version of events,” said the panel in affirming the lower court ruling. #### "

"'Too cute' yoga instructor can't make case in sex bias suit ";"Risk Management";"Off Beat";" ##### Being “too cute” doesn't make it as grounds for a gender discrimination lawsuit, says a New York judge, in dismissing case filed by a yoga instructor who was allegedly the unhappy target of a jealous wife. ####  ##### Dilek Edwards had been hired as a yoga and massage therapist by Charles V. Nicolai, co-owner of Wall Street Chiropractic and Wellness in New York, in April 2012, according to the May 11 ruling by the New York Supreme Court in Dilek Edwards v. Charles V. Nicolai and Stephanie Adams. ####  ##### According to the ruling Mr. Nicolai warned Ms. Edwards that his wife — who is a former Playboy Playmate, according to news reports — might become jealous because she was “too cute,” although Ms. Edwards contended she and Mr. Nicolai had a “strictly professional relationship.” ####  ##### On Oct. 29, 2013, Ms. Edwards received a text from Mr. Nicolai's wife, whom she had only met once, warning her to stay away from her husband and family. She was fired by Mr. Nicolai the next day. ####  ##### Ms. Edwards filed suit charging gender discrimination. But, unfortunately for Ms. Edwards, cuteness cannot be the basis of a gender discrimination charge, according to Judge Shlomo S. Hagler's ruling. ####  ##### “Even were this court to consider plaintiff's new theory of 'appearance-based discrimination,' this Court is constrained under the law to make a determination that defendants' behavior, no matter how abhorrent, fails to constitute gender discrimination,” said Judge Hagler, in dismissing the case. #### "

"Supreme Court attorneys' fees ruling hits home with EEOC suits";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Regulation, Claims Disputes, Claims Management, General liability";" ##### A U.S. Supreme Court ruling that holds a defendant does not need to win a case based on its merits to be considered the “prevailing” party and therefore entitled to attorneys' fees, will help employers in challenging EEOC litigation, experts say. ####  ##### The Supreme Court, however, did not issue a final ruling in CRST Van Expedited Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , because the EEOC had presented a new argument for the first time during oral arguments. ####  ##### So, the case was remanded to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis for further proceedings. ####  ##### The complex litigation began in 2007, when the EEOC charged Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based CRST with sexual discrimination and a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 while training 270 women. ####  ##### On the case's long, convoluted path, the U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids dismissed the cases of all but 67 of the women on a variety of grounds.  It then barred the remaining 67 women on the ground that the Commission had not satisfied its presuit requirements before filing the lawsuit. ####  ##### Ultimately, EEOC and CRST agreed that the trucking firm would pay $50,000 to settle the claim by the original plaintiff, Monika Starke. ####  ##### In the course of the extensive litigation, the District Court twice awarded CRST more than $4 million in attorney fees and was twice reversed by the 8th Circuit. ####  ##### In reversing the award the second time, the appeals court said a party can be considered “prevailing” and entitled to attorneys' fees only if there had been a ruling on the merits, which was not the case here. ####  ##### Because of the circuit court split over this issue, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case last year. ####  ##### “The Court now holds that a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant has prevailed,” said the court, in a ruling delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy. ####  ##### The Supreme Court, however, “has not set forth in detail how courts should determine whether a defendant has prevailed.” The question of whether CRST is the prevailing party “represents the central issue in this case.” ####  ##### A favorable judgment on the merits is not necessary for a party to prevail, said the ruling. “Common sense undermines the notion that a defendant cannot 'prevail' unless the relevant disposition is on the merits.” ####  ##### The defendant has “fulfilled its primary objective when the plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court's decision … There is no indication that Congress intended that defendants should be eligible to recover attorneys' fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits.” ####  ##### “Congress must have intended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivolous, unreasonable or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant's favor, whether on the merits or not,” the ruling said. ####  ##### The court, however, did not issue a final ruling on the matter because, it said, the EEOC had introduced a new argument that a defendant must obtain a “preclusive judgment,” or a final judgment no longer subject to appeal, to prevail. ####  ##### “The commission's failure to articulate its preclusion theory before the eleventh hour has resulted in inadequate briefing on the issue,” said the Supreme Court in remanding the case to the 8th Circuit for further proceedings. ####  ##### The EEOC said in a statement, “We are reviewing the decision, and we look forward to presenting our arguments to the Eighth Circuit.” ####  ##### “It's a victory for employers in the Title VII case … even though the Supreme Court in essence declined to issue a ruling on it and remanded it back to the District Court for further determination,” said Tina R. Syring, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg L.L.P. in Minneapolis, who was not involved in the case. ####  ##### The only reason it was remanded was “new arguments had been presented during oral arguments, and some of it had not been fully briefed,” said Ms. Syring. ####  ##### “This is a clear victory for employers,” said Kevin M. Kraham, a shareholder with Littler Mendelson P.C. in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court “clearly and unequivocally” provided “unambiguous instruction that a defendant should be able to recover atones fees when a court rejects the plaintiff's claim of discrimination, and that a win is a win, regardless of how the win comes about.” ####  ##### “The practical impact here is that employers will have available an additional way to challenge the commission's pre-suit conduct,” Mr. Kraham said. “In other words, if the EEOC were fulfilling its statutory mandate by investigating first, and then conciliating, instead of suing first, and then investigating, we wouldn't find ourselves where we are,” Mr. Kraham said. ####  ##### “Congress wanted to relieve employers of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous lawsuits, and the Supreme Court provided a means to an end for employers to address these types of suits,” he said. ####  ##### Miriam R. Nemetz, a partner with Mayer Brown L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., said however, the ruling will not have “a huge impact as a practical matter. Defendants are only entitled to attorneys fees in a pretty narrow range of cases, so I don't see an explosion of defendants getting awards of attorneys' fees in employment cases.” ####  ##### It is helpful, she added, however, in suggesting the EEOC could be subject to attorneys' fees if it does not satisfy presuit obligations, said Ms. Nemetz. ####  ##### It “is important as part of a constellation of cases establishing what defendants can do or what remedies they may have, if they feel the EEOC has not satisfied its conciliation obligations,” Ms. Nemetz said. #### "
"Supreme Court sides with worker on constructive discharge case ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Risk Management, General liability";" ##### The clock starts ticking on how long a worker has to file a complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when he resigns, not when the discriminatory action occurred, said the U.S. Supreme Court in a Monday ruling. ####  ##### Marvin Green, an African-American man who worked for the U.S. Postal Service for 35 years, was passed over for a promotion to the vacant postmaster position in Boulder, Colorado, in 2008, according to the court's 7-1 ruling in Green v. Brennan, Postmaster General. Shortly after, he complained he was denied the promotion because of his race. ####  ##### “Green's relations with his supervisor crumbled following his complaint,” with tension peaking in December 2009 when two of his supervisors accused Mr. Green of intentionally delaying the mail, which is a criminal offense. ####  ##### On Dec. 16, 2009, Mr. Green and the Postal Service reached an agreement under which he agreed to either retire or accept a position at a salary considerably lower than he had had been earning. Mr. Green submitted his resignation on Feb. 9, 2010. ####  ##### On March 22 of that year, 41 days after submitting his resignation but 96 days after signing the settlement agreement, Mr. Greene contacted a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission counselor to report an unlawful constructive discharge. ####  ##### He eventually filed suit against the Postal Service in U.S. District Court in Denver. The Postal Service moved for summary judgment dismissing the case, arguing the 45 days that Mr. Green had as a federal employee to file a complaint started upon the signing of the settlement agreement, not his resignation. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver subsequently affirmed the lower court's ruling. ####  ##### The Supreme Court decided to hear the case because of a circuit split on this issue, according to the ruling, and held that the statute of limitations began with Mr. Green's resignation, not the signing of the settlement agreement. ####  ##### A constructive discharge claim “accrues only after an employee resigns,” said the ruling. “The constructive-discharge doctrine contemplates a situation in which an employer discriminates against an employee to the point that 'working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign,' ” said the court, citing an earlier ruling. ####  ##### “In this respect, a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee,” and the statute of limitations begins with the resignation, just as it does when the worker is fired, said the court, in overturning the appellate court ruling and remanding the case for further proceedings. ####  ##### Justice Clarence Thomas issued a dissenting opinion in the case, stating that the majority ruling “expands the constructive-discharge doctrine.” ####  ##### Brian D.

Citizens Bank, N.A. et al. ####  ##### Ms. Tang said her encounters with Mr. Mackey included a meeting where he discussed how he wished his Thai au pairs wore more revealing swimsuits. ####  ##### Ms. Tang said she received a negative performance review from Mr. Nackley, after he realized she was not responding to his advances. She was terminated in June 2011. ####  ##### Ms. Tang filed charges including sexual harassment against the bank in U.S. District Court in Boston, which granted the bank summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### A unanimous three-judge panel reinstated Ms. Tang's sexual harassment and retaliation claims Thursday. Discussing Mr. Nackley's comments about his Thai au pairs, the ruling said “the defendants note that Tang does not allege that he ever made blatantly sexual comments about them. ####  ##### “But Title VII requires no magic words to convert a verbal exchange into the stuff of sexual harassment … The context in which something is said may be just as important as what is said,” said the court in remanding the case for further proceedings. #### "
"Shaq looks back with insurer (celebrity) endorsement";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, Auto liability, Off Beat";" ##### Basketball great Shaquille O'Neal has a personal tie to the latest in his long line of product endorsements. ####  ##### In his college days at Louisiana State University in the 1980s, Shaq first bought car insurance for his Ford Bronco from The General, American Family Mutual Insurance Co.'s higher risk line, so it was natural for him to endorse the insurer, according to ESPN.com. ####  ##### “I got the car for $2,200, and my dad said, 'Now you need insurance.' I remember asking him what insurance was and why I needed it and eventually had a policy with The General,” he told the sports website. ####  ##### Ever popular, Mr. O'Neal also sells suits at Macy's, jewelry at Zale's and a flavor line of Arizona Iced Tea, as well as endorsing Gold Bond and Icy Hot. ####  ##### Over his 19-year NBA career, Mr. O'Neal was on four championship teams and played in Orlando, Florida, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Cleveland and Boston, where he retired in 2011.

"Chubb unit seeks to rescind product liability policy";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers, Chubb";" ##### A medical robotics firm continues to defend itself against efforts by a Chubb Ltd. unit to rescind its $15 million products liability policy because of an alleged failure to notify the insurer of pending litigation before obtaining the coverage, while an excess insurer has reached a settlement in the case. ####  ##### Chubb unit Illinois Union Insurance Co. contends in a suit originally filed in 2013 that it would not have issued its $15 million products liability policy to Sunnyvale, California-based Intuitive Surgical Inc. had it known the extent of possible litigation against the firm. ####  ##### But another insurer that had participated in the litigation, New York-based Navigators Specialty Insurance Co., which had an excess policy that provided $10 million in claims made coverage over Illinois Union's primary policy, reached a confidential settlement with Intuitive, according to court papers filed last week in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The case is Illinois Union Insurance Co. v. Intuitive Surgical Inc. ####  ##### In the most recent development, the District Court on Friday denied a partial summary judgment motion by Illinois Union to dismiss the case. ####  ##### According to the court papers, Intuitive Surgical' s one product line, the da Vinci Surgical System, has been in use since the early 2000s and had performed more than to 400,000 surgical procedures by 2012. ####  ##### The surgeon using the minimally invasive robotic system sits at a console away from the patient and manipulates robotic arms with a variety of micro-surgical attachments. Intuitive says the system causes less trauma and requires shorter hospital stays than traditional surgery. ####  ##### Illinois Union issued to Intuitive a products liability insurance policy in force from March 2013 through March 2014. The policy provided for $15,000-per-occurrence coverage and aggregate limits, including defense costs, over a $5 million-per-occurrence and aggregate self-insured retention. ####  ##### Illinois Union contends that though Intuitive disclosed 24 open claims when it applied for the insurance, it did not mention 734 “tolling agreements” with claimants. A tolling agreement waives a right to claim that litigation should be dismissed because a statute of limitations had run out. ####  ##### “It is axiomatic that you cannot buy insurance for a burning house,” say court papers submitted by Illinois Union. “Yet, that is exactly what Intuitive attempted to do here. The court should not allow it. ####  ##### “The undisputed facts show that Illinois Union is entitled as matter of law to rescind the products liability policy it issued to Intuitive based on concealment of material facts in the application process for the policy.” ####  ##### In its ruling Friday, Judge Jon S. Tigar said he was denying Illinois Union’s motion for partial summary judgment because there was a “material dispute” regarding concealment of the tolling agreements and whether Illinois Union knew about them before the policy was issued. Alternatively, said Judge Tigar, summary judgment is inappropriate because of underwriters’ “contradictory deposition testimony” in the case. #### "
"Valeant to pay $54 million settlement in drug kickback scheme ";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. will pay $54 million to settle civil charges that its Salix unit paid illegal kickbacks to induce doctors to prescribe seven of its products, causing the submission of thousands of fraudulent reimbursement claims to the U.S. government. ####  ##### The accord announced Thursday by the U.S. Department of Justice covers alleged improper activity at the former Salix Pharmaceuticals Inc. from 2009 to 2013, predating its April 2015 acquisition by Valeant for more than $11 billion. ####  ##### Salix admitted and accepted responsibility for routinely paying doctors hundreds or thousands of dollars, or offering perks including lavish meals at restaurants such as Le Bernardin and Nobu, to attend some of its roughly 10,000 ""speaker programs,"" including many with little or no educational value. ####  ##### One doctor from Rochester, New York, allegedly received more than $200,000 for attending numerous events, including some where he was told not to do slide presentations and that dinner was the only gathering planned. ####  ##### ""Receipts from Salix's speaker programs — which were approved by managers — evidence the existence of speaker programs that were quite clearly happy hours,"" the government added. ####  ##### The Justice Department said the kickback scheme worked, as many attendees began prescribing Salix products more often. ####  ##### It said this led to thousands of false payment claims being submitted to Medicare and Medicaid, and two health care programs serving active and retired military personnel. ####  ##### ""Salix found a way to pay doctors money and treated them to fancy meals to push their drugs,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. ####  ##### The drugs and devices covered by the lawsuit are Apriso, Deflux, MoviPrep, OsmoPrep, Relistor, Solesta and Xifaxan. ####  ##### Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said that the company is pleased to settle and that the alleged misconduct ""involved personnel who are no longer with the company."" ####  ##### The payment marks an additional financial strain on Laval, Quebec-based Valeant, whose stock price has fallen more than 90 percent since August amid scrutiny over its business and accounting practices and high debt load. ####  ##### Salix's settlement resolves claims originally brought under the federal False Claims Act in two lawsuits by the physician Steven Peikin and four former Salix employees. ####  ##### Such lawsuits let whistleblowers bring cases on behalf of the U.S. government, and share in any recoveries. The government typically joins cases it considers stronger. ####  ##### According to settlement papers, Salix will pay $46.53 million to the United States and $7.47 million to resolve civil fraud claims by various U.S. states. #### "
"AIG, Travelers units not liable for payment on asbestos claims ";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Risk Management, AIG, The Travelers Cos., General liability";" ##### Units of Travelers Cos. Inc. and American International Group Inc. that had provided excess coverage to a now-bankrupt asbestos manufacturer are not obligated under their policies' terms to provide coverage until primary insurers have paid in full under their policies, says a bankruptcy court. ####  ##### New York-based Rapid-American Corp., which started getting sued for asbestos-related personal injury claims in 1974, settled many of the claims by the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2013, but it still had about 275,000 asbestos-related personal injury claims pending against it at the time, according to Tuesday's ruling by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Rapid-American Corp. et al. v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. et al. ####  ##### Beginning in 1998, Rapid-American reached settlements with nearly all of its insurers, but a number of them became insolvent and unable to pay the full limits of their policies, according to the ruling. An amount sufficient to reach the level of excess coverage provided under the policies at issue has not been paid, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Rapid-American plaintiffs in the litigation argue the excess policies at issue provide total limits of $64 million, according to the ruling. They contend it is unnecessary for the primary policies' underlying limits to be exhausted by actual payment before the insurers' excess liability coverage attaches. ####  ##### U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Stuart M. Bernstein, however, agreed with the insurers that this was not the case, based on the insurers' policy language. These policies “unambiguously require actual payment before liability attaches,” said Judge Bernstein in ruling in the insurers' favor on the issue. ####  ##### Decades after it became a major issue, insurers' ultimate asbestos liability remains unknown, according to a report issued in October 2015 by Oldwick, New Jersey-based rating agency A.M. Best Co. Inc. on asbestos and environmental losses. #### "
"Ruling against Greenberg raises stakes in Trump University case";"Risk Management";"Risk Management, AIG";" ##### (Reuters) — A ruling by New York's highest court in a fraud case against former American International Group Inc. Chief Executive Maurice R. Greenberg could affect the state's case against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his defunct Trump University. ####  ##### The New York Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could seek to recoup millions of dollars in bonus payments to Mr. Greenberg using the legal remedy called disgorgement. ####  ##### Unlike damages, which are used to compensate victims' losses, disgorgement requires a defendant to give back gains obtained from unlawful means. The ruling means that Mr. Schneiderman can go after $5 million he says Trump personally pocketed from the Trump University real-estate seminar venture. ####  ##### ""It doesn't help him,"" Jeffrey Goldman, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the New York case, said on Monday of the Greenberg ruling. But Mr. Goldman said Trump expected to win the case and could also try to limit the amount subject to disgorgement, such as by arguing that most of it was earned outside of New York. ####  ##### According to the state's 2013 lawsuit against Mr. Trump, filed in state court in Manhattan, Trump University was an unlicensed, illegal operation that bilked students of up to $35,000 each between 2005 and 2011. Two proposed class actions in California make similar allegations. ####  ##### Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly raised the Trump University litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated. He has also accused the federal judge overseeing the California lawsuits of being biased against him because of his ethnicity. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. ####  ##### In the Greenberg case, the state accused the former CEO of orchestrating sham transactions at AIG and misleading shareholders about the company's financial health between 2000 and 2005. Mr. Schneiderman is asking that Mr. Greenberg disgorge some $25 million in bonuses during that period, plus interest. ####  ##### Mr. Greenberg has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, David Boies, who represented Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore in the dispute over the 2000 election recount, had argued that disgorgement was not a remedy available to the New York attorney general under either the state's securities fraud law or another fraud statute. The Court of Appeals rejected MR. Boies' arguments. ####  ##### The ability to seek disgorgement may be useful to Mr. Schneiderman because the California cases involving Trump University may be resolved before the New York case. One is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28, just a few weeks after the Nov. 8 election. ####  ##### A settlement or judgment in those cases could undermine Mr. Schneiderman's claim for $40 million in damages because he is suing on behalf of many of the same former Trump University students. But disgorgement claims would not be affected. #### "
"French bank pays rogue trader for termination";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Legislation & Regulation, Regulation, Risk Management, France, Financial Results, Claims Disputes, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — A ""rogue trader"" who cost French bank Societe Generale billions of euros in losses won a wrongful dismissal case on Tuesday when a labor court ordered Jerome Kerviel's former employer to pay him €450,000 ($510,000) in compensation. ####  ##### The court, made up of equal numbers of representatives of employers and trade unions, ruled that the bank fired Kerviel without ""real and serious cause"" because it waited too long to dismiss him after becoming aware of his misconduct. ####  ##### SocGen lawyer Arnaud Chaulet branded the ruling ""scandalous"" and said the bank would appeal against a decision he said ran counter to the law. ####  ##### Kerviel, 39, was sentenced to three years in jail after being convicted by a Paris court in October 2010 for breach of trust and fraud in the loss of €4.9 billion in equity derivatives trades that went terribly wrong in 2008. ####  ##### Tuesday's ruling seemed bound to fuel controversy over the role of labor courts after the Socialist government dropped an attempt this year to limit by law the amount of damages they can award for wrongful dismissal. ####  ##### The trader has never denied masking his €50 billion positions, but contends his managers should have been aware of his actions, something the bank has always strenuously denied. ####  ##### France's labor code gives companies two months to sanction misconduct, but the tribunal found that his positions had been known since 2007 whereas Kerviel was dismissed in February 2008, his lawyer David Koubbi said. ####  ##### Koubbi told Reuters the decision ""restores justice and tears apart the story that Societe Generale has presented from the beginning"". ####  ##### The ruling comes as Kerviel faces a separate civil case due to start next week before an appellate court in Versailles about how much he has to pay the bank towards the losses. ####  ##### France's highest court of appeal upheld Kerviel's jail sentence in March 2014, but ruled that he was not liable for 4.9 billion in damages sought by the bank, opening the way for the civil trial to determine a fine. #### "

"Property/casualty insurers applaud Fed's proposed SIFI rules ";"Risk Management";"P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Regulation, Risk Management, AIG, MetLife";" ##### The property/casualty insurance industry is giving a generally favorable response to the Federal Reserve Bank's possible capital standards for systemically important insurance companies. ####  ##### The Fed issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on Friday, inviting comment on conceptual frameworks for capital standards that could apply to systemically important insurance companies and to insurance companies that own a bank or thrift. ####  ##### The Fed said in a statement that it was considering two approaches. “one approach — called the consolidated approach — that would apply to systemically important insurance companies, and a second approach — called the building block approach — for less complex insurance companies that also own a bank or thrift,” said the statement. ####  ##### “For systemically important insurance companies, the consolidated approach would categorize an entire insurance firm's assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments, apply appropriate risk factors to each segment at the consolidated level, and then set a minimum ratio of required capital,” said the Fed in the statement. ####  ##### The statement noted that the Fed currently supervises two systemically important insurance companies: American International Group, Inc. and Prudential Financial, Inc. A third insurer — MetLife Inc. — successfully challenged its designation as a systemically important financial institution in U.S. District Court, but the federal government is appealing. ####  ##### Property/casualty insurers generally hailed the Fed's move. ####  ##### The Property Casualty Insurers Association of America “applauds this major step forward in developing a group capital approach for domestic insurance holding companies subject to the Fed's supervision,” said Robert Gordon, PCI's Washington-based senior vice president, policy development and research, in a statement. “PCI will analyze the proposed rule and looks forward to continuing to work with the Fed. It is important to get this right, as the Fed's approach to capital standards may set a precedent for the state-based U.S. regulatory system and may also impact the international deliberations.” ####  ##### “Congress has been very engaged in expressing concerns about adoption of international insurance standards and the need to appropriately sequence the development of domestic capital standards that are pro-consumer and pro-competition,” added Mr. Gordon. “PCI will continue to engage with members of Congress who are developing legislation also addressing some of these issues.” ####  ##### “Today's issuance of the ANPR outlining the Federal Reserve's bifurcated approach to group capital for prudentially supervised insurance firms is an important next step in the implementation process of the Dodd-Frank Act,” said Leigh Ann Pusey, president and CEO of the Washington-based American Insurance Association, in a statement issued Friday. “It provided additional clarity on the Federal Reserve's underlying rationale and sets the stage for public input on its intended approach.” ####  ##### “For any additional regulation or standards for American insurers to be effective, it's vital that they be based on the state regulatory system,” said Charles M. Chamness, president and CEO of the Indianapolis-based National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, in a statement. “Relying on risk-based capital standards and allowing the use of statutory accounting principles will provide everything the Fed needs to monitor the solvency of those insurance companies under its jurisdiction not labeled systemically important.” ####  ##### “The frameworks we are considering would address all the risks across an insurance company's regulated and unregulated subsidiaries,” said Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen in the Fed statement. “I believe this proposal is an important step toward capital standards that are both appropriate for our supervised insurance firms and that enhance the resiliency and stability of our financial system.” #### "
"Texas on pace to set record-high insured losses from storms";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, Aon Benfield, Catastrophe Modeling";" ##### The deadly storms that hit Texas this week have resulted in over $6 billion in insured losses, an industry analyst said, with the potential for more losses this weekend. ####  ##### Steve Bowen, Chicago-based director of Impact Forecasting, Aon Benfield Group Ltd.'s catastrophe modeling development team, said Thursday that Texas has already set a record for the highest severe convective storm-related insured losses for the year. ####  ##### “The industry in the state is already facing more than $6 billion in payouts from primarily hail-driven events and we have yet to hit the mid-point of the year,” Mr. Bowen said in an email. “It's a pretty staggering total. Most of those losses have occurred since the end of March, which further validates just how active this recent stretch has been for Texas.” ####  ##### Impact Forecasting said that more than 1,000 residents were evacuated and hundreds of water rescues were carried out by overwhelmed emergency services. News report have said that the most recent storm system has killed at least 12 people, including five soldiers stationed at the Fort Hood military base who died Thursday when their vehicle overturned in a flooded creek. ####  ##### Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a disaster for 31 affected counties on June 1. ####  ##### Mr. Bowen, who noted that current data is not available for the last three weeks, said there has not necessarily been an increase in frequency of hail or severe convective storm reports in Texas this year, but there have been particularly intense storms tracking over densely populated and exposed regions of the state. ####  ##### “When you consider how quickly the Texas population has grown in recent years,” he said, “the probability of severe weather impacting a populated area is also on the rise.” ####  ##### Citing U.S. Census Bureau data, the Office of the Texas Comptroller said that between 1980 and 2010, Texas' total population increased by 76.7%, from about 14.2 million to more than 25 million. ####  ##### Despite the losses, Mr. Bowen said the insurance industry is currently well positioned to be able to handle the volume of storm claims. ####  ##### “The last few years on the whole — thanks to a dearth of hurricane landfalls in the United States – has left insurance capital at record high levels,” Mr. Bowen said in his email. “With that said, any time states are faced with economic damages in the billions of dollars, it is going to put a strain on local budgets. Noninsurable damage to things such as infrastructure often adds up quickly.” ####  ##### The Insurance Council of Texas said the Lone Star State has been hammered by severe storms and flooding this year. Hailstorms in Fort Worth and Plano in March resulted in $1.3 billion in insured losses and an April 11 hailstorm in Wylie caused $300 million in insured losses. ####  ##### The council said auto and homeowner losses from last month's hailstorms in San Antonio are mounting as insured losses have reached $1.9 billion. This estimate does not include any commercial losses, such as schools, grocery stores, retail outlets or office buildings, which could push the total insured losses well over $2 billion. ####  ##### “Hail fell somewhere in Texas on 20 days in April and 25 days in the month of May,” Mark Hanna, the council's public relations manager, said in a statement. “Our continuing round of severe thunderstorms has also unleashed a record amount of rainfall that has resulted in major flooding in many parts of the state.” ####  ##### The council said that many insurances have already handled more wind and hail claims for this year than all of last year. ####  ##### The National Weather Service issued a hazardous weather outlook for South Central Texas on Friday, forecasting scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms on Saturday, which are expected to become more isolated to scattered by Sunday. A few storms could briefly become strong with small hail and gusty winds up to 50 MPH. ####  ##### While thunderstorm-related losses have been high in Texas this year, Mr. Bowen said these losses pale when compared with the costs that the state incurred from Hurricane Ike in 2008, which caused nearly $20 billion in damage in Texas alone, with public and private insurers picking up more than $12 billion of the losses. #### "

"OFF BEAT: Different kind of money laundering costs bank employee his job";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A youthful indiscretion and a strict interpretation of new regulations intended to stop banks from hiring employees convicted of financial crimes have cost a Wells Fargo Home Mortgage employee his job. ####  ##### According to the Des Moines Register, Richard Eggers of Des Moines, Iowa, was fired from his customer service job on July 2 after the bank learned of his 1963 conviction for “operating a coin changing machine by false means” after he attempted to use a cardboard cutout of a dime at a laundromat. ####  ##### The decades-old conviction came to light after the bank hired a background-screening firm to scour the arrest records of employees in the wake of new ethics guidelines for bank employees issued in May 2011 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Intended to thwart people convicted of serious crimes such as money laundering from working in prominent positions at banks, the law instead has affected mostly low-level employees, an attorney for Mr. Eggers said. ####  ##### While the FDIC provides a waiver for people convicted of small crimes to prove that they are worthy of employment, the process can take six to 12 months. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Makers of Ab Circle Pro busted by FTC for deceptive flab-vertising ";"Risk Management";"";" ##### If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which busted an exercise device maker for deceiving consumers about the effectiveness of its product. ####  ##### In television infomercials than ran at least 10,000 times between March 2009 and May 2010, the makers of the Ab Circle Pro claimed that a three-minute workout on the device was equal to performing 100 sit-ups. However, the company is now recanting those claims and has agreed to provide up to $25 million in refunds to consumers who purchased the device. ####  ##### In the infomercial, pitchwoman Jennifer Nicole Lee compared the Ab Circle Pro to a gym workout, saying, “You can either do 30 minutes of abs and cardio or just three minutes a day. The choice is yours.” The infomercial also featured testimonials from other individuals claiming they had lost as much as 60 pounds using the device. ####  ##### In addition to being sold via the infomercial, the Ab Circle Pro also was marketed online, in stores, in one- and two-minute television commercials and in print advertisements. Consumers who purchased the device through the infomercial paid between $200 and $250, while the price for those buying from retailers varied more widely, according to the FTC. ####  ##### The FTC’s complaint names as defendants Fitness Brands Inc., Fitness Brands International Inc., and the two individuals who control them, Michael Casey and David Brodess; Direct Holdings Americas Inc. and Direct Entertainment Media Group Inc.; infomercial producer Tara Borakos and two companies she controls, Tara Productions Inc. and New U Inc.; and Jennifer Nicole Lee and two companies she controls, JNL Inc. and JNL Worldwide Inc. The complaint also names Reader’s Digest Association Inc. as a relief defendant, alleging that the company received proceeds of the deceptive advertising from its subsidiaries, Direct Holdings Americas and Direct Entertainment Media Group. ####  ##### “The FTC reminds marketers that they should think twice before promising a silver-bullet solution to a health problem—whether it involves losing weight or curing cancer,"" said David Vladeck, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “Weight loss is hard work, and telling consumers otherwise is deceptive.” #### "
"Wal-Mart settles employee's EEOC disability discrimination lawsuit for $50,000 ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and one of its units has reached a $50,000 settlement of a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in which the retailer was charged with failing to accommodate a 22-year employee who suffers from cerebral palsy. ####  ##### The EEOC said Wal-Mart fired Marcia Arney, a part-time clerk, from her position in its Carlsbad, N.M., store rather than trying to return her to her job after a medical leave related to her cerebral palsy. Ms. Arney had shown the store manager a note from her doctor requesting an accommodation involving periodic breaks off her feet, but the manager refused to return her to her job and instead demanded that she obtain a medical release with no restrictions, according to the EEOC's statement. ####  ##### “The EEOC alleges that the medical restriction could have easily been accommodated by the giant retailer. In fact, had the employer inquired further, it would have learned that her need for accommodation was temporary,” said the agency, which charged Wal-Mart with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. ####  ##### In addition to $50,000 in back pay and damages, provisions of the settlement with Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and its Wal-Mart Stores East L.P. unit include that Wal-Mart conduct annual live ADA training of management officials at its Carlsbad store. ####  ##### Robert A. Canino, regional attorney for the EEOC's Dallas district office, said in a statement, “Federal regulations explaining amendments to the (Americans with Disabilities Act) made it clear that many impairments, cerebral palsy among them, do not require a lengthy analysis to determine whether or not they are 'substantially limiting,' which is the standard for coverage. Employers who used to argue otherwise should get up to speed on the clarifications Congress made to the (Americans with Disabilities Act) to ensure that most people with disabilities will be covered.” ####  ##### A Wal-Mart spokesman responded that this case involved a now-former local store manager who “was not fully in compliance with company policies.” ####  ##### The spokesman said, “This was an unfortunate, isolated incident in our Carlsbad store and in no way reflects the manner in which we conduct business at our stores or treat our associates. Wal-Mart does not condone or tolerate discrimination of any type. We take it seriously any time allegations or questions are raised about our (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliance.” #### "

"AIR Worldwide puts insured Isaac losses as high as $2 billion";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, P/C Insurers";" ##### Hurricane Isaac caused insured damage estimated at $700 million to $2 billion to onshore U.S. properties, catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide Corp. said Friday. ####  ##### The estimate includes damage from wind and storm surge affecting onshore residential, commercial and industrial properties and their contents, automobiles as well as time-element coverage, which includes additional living expenses for residential properties and business interruption for commercial properties. ####  ##### AIR noted that initial reports of Isaac's damage focused on flooding, but wind damage has received less attention. ####  ##### “However, Isaac's slow forward speed and refusal to dissipate will exacerbate wind damage,” Tim Doggett, principal scientist at AIR, said in a statement. “As the winds persist, roof fasteners and connections can become fatigued and overloaded, causing additional damage, and the possibility of damage from flying building debris persists.” ####  ##### AIR also said it takes less wind to knock down trees due to the rain-saturated soil. ####  ##### The catastrophe modeler said it does not expect significant physical damage to offshore oil rigs and gas platforms from wind or waves. As a result of hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, business interruption coverage purchased by the energy industry is a “much rarer coverage than in years past,” AIR said. ####  ##### AIR said it does not expect significant insured losses to offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of Isaac. #### "
"Knight accepts Nasdaq's $62M Facebook payback plan";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters)—After heaping criticism on Nasdaq OMX Group's initial offer for compensating brokers for its botching of Facebook Inc.'s initial public offering, trading firm Knight Capital Group Inc. said it accepts the exchange's latest plan, which would pay out $62 million. ####  ##### The plan, which Nasdaq has called its ""definitive word"" on the Facebook debacle, is under consideration by the SEC and brings into question the extent to which an exchange can be liable for technical slip-ups. U.S. exchanges match hundreds of billions of dollars of securities transactions every day. ####  ##### Knight's support comes after Nasdaq increased the payback fund to $62 million in cash from an earlier $40 million, made up mostly of trading rebates, the market-making firm said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Aug. 29. ####  ##### Nasdaq has around 300 member firms that trade on the exchange. Knight and other retail market-making firms and brokers together lost more than $500 million in the IPO. ####  ##### Of the handful of comment letters on the compensation plan, two have voiced support: Knight's and hedge fund Citadel L.L.C.'s. Seven—from market makers, brokers, and lawyers for individual investors—have called for it to be rejected. ####  ##### ""Although we would have preferred that the accommodation pool cover all losses sustained by Nasdaq members, we do support Nasdaq's proposal,"" Knight said in the letter. ####  ##### Knight, which facilitates trades for other firms, had called Nasdaq's earlier plan ""inadequate,"" and said it was considering legal action over the Facebook IPO. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Liabilities at exchanges, which have some regulatory duties, are capped in most instances. Nasdaq's cap is $3 million. ####  ##### Much of the debate around the plan has focused on whether Nasdaq should be able to cloak itself in regulatory immunity in situations where it is operating as a for-profit entity. ####  ##### Facebook's eagerly anticipated IPO on May 18, which raised $16 billion, was initially delayed by 30 minutes due to a technical glitch at Nasdaq. ####  ##### The exchange then made the decision to get the stock trading by using a secondary system that ended up leading to delays in many clients orders and confirmations, costing some investors and traders big losses as the stock price dropped after an initial gain. ####  ##### UBS A.G., which disclosed it lost more than $350 million, and Citigroup's Automated Trading Desk, which is said to have lost up to $35 million, have argued that Nasdaq should be responsible for all of the losses because the decision to move forward with the IPO was a business decision made in haste. ####  ##### Further, Citi said trading of Facebook should not have been allowed to continue during the confusion that followed. ####  ##### But Knight, which said it lost more than $35 million in the IPO, urged the SEC to leave the discussion of liability limitations and regulatory immunity to another day. Citadel, which is said to have lost $20 million, made a similar request. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Knight did urge the SEC to reject a portion of Nasdaq's plan requiring firms that sign on to waive their right to sue the exchange, likely before they know how much they will be reimbursed. Knight said that would set ""a harmful precedent."" ####  ##### ""Setting forth those types of requirements in the context of a rule filing inappropriately mixes commercial issues with regulatory requirements,"" Knight said in the three-page letter also addressed to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. ####  ##### It said if the SEC disagrees and determines that some form of release is appropriate, it should only be sought after Nasdaq members are notified of the amount Nasdaq is willing to pay under the terms of the accommodation plan. ####  ##### A Nasdaq spokesman had no comment on Knight's letter. ####  ##### Nasdaq also faces regulatory investigations into its systems and actions during the IPO. ####  ##### Knight had its own trading glitch on Aug. 1, costing the firm $440 million and nearly forcing it into bankruptcy before a group of independent firms saved it with a $400 million investment. #### "
"Strategic risk management provides a competitive edge";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management";" ##### For companies that embrace the concept, strategic risk management provides a formal mechanism for addressing exposures that can threaten the execution of an organization's strategy, along with a tool for helping organizations exploit the opportunities that can be the flip side of risk. ####  ##### While some organizations might integrate strategic risk management into a broader enterprise risk management program, SRM is “a laser focus,” said Carol Fox, director of strategic and enterprise risk practice at the New York-based Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. That program concentrates on strategy planning and execution “in a very focused and disciplined way.” ####  ##### “It really is to physically focus on planning and strategic execution,” Ms. Fox said. ####  ##### Seeing a number of different definitions of strategic risk management and a lack of consistency in discussions of what it entailed, RIMS provided its own formal definition of SRM in 2011. According to RIMS' definition, strategic risk management “is a business discipline that drives deliberation and action regarding uncertainties and untapped opportunities that affect an organization's strategy and strategic execution.” ####  ##### Used effectively, strategic risk management can identify situations in which risk can be a competitive advantage instead of strictly a threat to a strategic plan. ####  ##### “As you go down that maturity, ultimately the goal is you want to include risk in your decision-making process, improving the way you make decisions and the speed at which you can make decisions,” said Steve Zawoyski, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Minneapolis. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In assessing their organizations' risks, some risk managers might tend to think, “If I start off with just hazards, I can move on to opportunities three years from now,” Mr. Zawoyski said. “Well, my caution is, if you only talk to people about hazards, all they think about is hazards.” ####  ##### Strategic risk management can be integrated into a wider enterprise risk management program, Ms. Fox said. “We would argue that all organizations should have an enterprise risk management umbrella,” she said. But, acknowledging that many organizations for whatever reason are likely not to move toward ERM, Ms. Fox said those organizations can still embrace SRM, “in this case specifically focusing risk management practices in a strategic way.” ####  ##### “Strategic risk management is an element and a necessary foundation for ERM,” said Mark L. Frigo, director of the Center for Strategy, Execution, and Valuation and the Strategic Risk Management Lab in the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business of DePaul University in Chicago. “It is often a missing element in existing ERM programs. And for organizations starting to develop ERM, it is a necessary foundation for building an effective and sustainable ERM program that creates as well as protects value.” ####  ##### Mr. Frigo said SRM requires thinking differently about risk and uncertainty. “There are a number of obstacles for developing SRM that need to be overcome,” he said. “One obstacle is overcoming the status quo way of thinking about risk management in the organization.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “The thing that needs to be clear from the outset is you're really partnering with those who have responsibility for strategy,” Ms. Fox said. “There are certain organizations where it might be seen as, 'We don't want to talk about risk because that's the downside.'” ####  ##### For strategic risk management efforts to succeed, the risk manager should be seen as a resource by those responsible for setting strategy, she said. “Helping them understand what's in it for them is probably the best approach,” she said. ####  ##### The interest in SRM at many organizations is driven by a realization that their ERM efforts were missing many strategic risks and a sense that much of their risk assessment wasn't “at the level needed to address risks that threaten organizations' survival,” said Rupak Mazumdar, senior manager, enterprise risk management at George Weston Ltd. in Toronto. ####  ##### At some organizations, “It's so difficult to put their hands around (strategic risks) in terms of these things happening that they omit them in their risk maps,” Mr. Mazumdar said. ####  ##### Also, some believe enterprise risk management is too focused on operations, Mr. Mazumdar said. “I think there are some in the ERM community who would say if you would have done it properly, you would have captured the strategic risks. There are others who say no,” he said. “I think it's a debate that's still occurring in the risk management community.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### DePaul's Mr. Frigo noted that ERM can take in a number of risks, some of which, while potentially harmful, don't threaten the organization's overall health or ability to meet its business objectives. However, recent events such as the 2008 financial market collapse and subsequent credit crisis offer examples of strategic risks that can threaten an organization's survival. ####  ##### “These more significant risk exposures have given rise to a focus on strategic risks and strategic risk management,” he said. ####  ##### Speaking to organizations' growing awareness of the need to address strategic risk, Marsh Inc.'s 2012 Excellence in Risk Management survey showed that 64% of C-suite and risk manager respondents listed a strategic view of risk and risk management's role as one of the top three abilities required to lead risk management. ####  ##### Asked how risks can be better integrated into their organization's strategic planning goals, 51% of C-suite survey respondents said by adopting a formal strategic risk management process, while 45% said by involving risk management in the early stages of strategic planning. ####  ##### “The good news is that many organizations are seizing the opportunities and integrate risk management deeply into their strategic planning,” said Brian Elowe, managing director in Marsh's global risk management division in Boston, during a June 20 webinar discussing strategic risk management. But other organizations have yet to do so, he said. ####  ##### George Weston's Mr. Mazumdar said he's still making up his mind about the need for a distinct SRM discipline in addition to ERM. “I can see the pros and cons of both,” he said. ####  ##### At present, George Weston is dealing with its strategic risks through its enterprise risk management process by making sure the ERM process is closely tied to the company's strategic planning process. “They're done in parallel,” Mr. Mazumdar said. ####  ##### “It's all in the execution,” he said. “Both ways can fall flat if you don't do it right.” ####  ##### This story is from the September 10, 2012, issue of the weekly print edition of Business Insurance, a special issue featuring how corporations and other entities are implementing strategic risk management. ####  ##### Copies of this issue, which includes a data poster featuring statistics on how SRM is being used, are available for $100 by contacting our Single Copy Sales department at 888-446-1422. ####  ##### To subscribe to Business Insurance to receive all future special print issues, click here. #### "

"Chinese drywall maker must face U.S. lawsuits: Judge";"Risk Management";"China, Construction";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. federal judge has ruled that a Chinese drywall maker must face claims over its allegedly tainted product, which has been blamed for causing foul odors, the failure of appliances and health problems. ####  ##### The ruling means homeowners will be able to pursue claims against the Chinese firm in U.S. courts, increasing the pressure for a settlement similar to that reached between plaintiffs and a German drywall maker last year. ####  ##### Judge Eldon Fallon of New Orleans on Monday denied motions by Taishan Gypsum Co. Ltd. to dismiss four lawsuits filed by homeowners whose properties were allegedly affected by faulty drywall. ####  ##### Judge Fallon also denied a request by Taishan to vacate a $2.6 million default judgment that he levied against the company in May 2010 after it had failed to make appearances in one of the cases. ####  ##### The ruling is the latest victory for plaintiffs in hundreds of drywall lawsuits that have been consolidated in New Orleans federal court. ####  ##### Last year, homeowners in the litigation settled with German company Knauf International over claims involving drywall manufactured by its Chinese subsidiary. As part of the settlement, funds were created to repair affected homes and compensate homeowners for economic losses and bodily harm. ####  ##### Russ Herman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he hoped that Judge Fallon's ruling would encourage Taishan to negotiate a similar settlement. ####  ##### After Judge Fallon entered the $2.6 million judgment against Taishan, the company's lawyers made appearances in the case and argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the company because of its lack of contacts with the United States. ####  ##### ""We believe that the Court was in error for all the reasons reflected in our papers and discussed at the hearing,"" said Joe Cyr, an attorney for Taishan. ####  ##### The consolidated cases are In Re: Chinese-Manufactured Drywall Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, No. 09-md-2047. #### "
"California hospital to pay $975,000 to settle racial harassment, discrimination case";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A California hospital has agreed to pay a $975,000 settlement in a harassment and discrimination case that alleged the employer created a hostile work environment for Filipino staff members. ####  ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center sued Delano, Calif.-based Delano Regional Medical Center in 2010 in U.S. District Court. The EEOC said the hospital's English-only language policy was used to harass and discriminate against Filipino employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### The case involved claims from about 70 current and former Filipino employees who said they were taunted and threatened by non-Filipino employees for speaking Tagalog or other Filipino languages while working at Delano. ####  ##### In 2006, Delano's CEO and management held a meeting exclusively for Filipino and Filipino-American employees regarding the health system's English-only policy, according a statement Monday from the EEOC. The policy required workers to speak English at all times at work, except during breaks or while working with non-English-speaking patients. ####  ##### For years after that point, EEOC said that the hospital and its policy encouraged employees to act as ""vigilantes"" in reprimanding and reporting Filipino employees who spoke Tagalog or Ilocano on the job. While Filipino employees were disciplined for allegedly violating the language policy, the EEOC said that workers who spoke Spanish and other languages on the job were not disciplined. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Although language policies are not illegal, the EEOC contends that such rules must have a business justification and cannot be used to target specific workers, said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC District Office in Los Angeles. ####  ##### “Under federal law, the EEOC takes the position that if it's a draconian policy where you must speak English all the time, not exempting out down time or time on your own, that we believe is ... discriminatory,” she said during a press conference Monday. ####  ##### Elnora Cayme, a class member who spoke during the press conference, said she and other Filipino employees were harassed by co-workers and received complaints about their accents even while speaking English on the job. ####  ##### “I always felt like people were following and watching us,” she said. ####  ##### In addition to the settlement payment announced Monday, Delano entered into a three-year consent decree with the EEOC to develop anti-discrimination procedures. The health system also must hire an equal employment opportunity compliance monitor. #### "
"Family of bystander killed in St. Thomas gang violence can sue Carnival: Court ";"Risk Management";"";" ##### The family of a 15-year-old girl who was shot and killed by crossfire in a gang fight that broke out while she was on an excursion from a cruise ship can sue Carnival Corp. for negligence, a federal appeals court has ruled. ####  ##### According to the Sept. 5 ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami in Aida Esther Chaparro et al. v. Carnival Corp., Liz Marie Perez Chaparro was on a Caribbean cruise aboard a vessel of Miami-based Carnival with her family when she was killed. ####  ##### A male Carnival employee suggested to her father, Amilkar Perez Chaparro, that they visit Coki Beach and Coral World upon disembarking the ship in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. On July 12, 2010, Ms. Chaparro and her family left the ship and traveled to Coki Beach independently of the ship's sponsored excursions, court records state. ####  ##### On their way back, they rode in an open-air bus past a funeral of a gang member. Funeral attendees' cars were parked along the narrow road, blocking the passage of the bus. While the bus was stuck in traffic, shots broke out among gang members and Ms. Chaparro was hit. ####  ##### While bus passengers called for an ambulance, it did not arrive and the bus driver speeded to the hospital. Ms. Chaparro was declared dead from a gunshot wound to the abdomen shortly after arriving. ####  ##### Ms. Chaparro's parents and brother filed suit, accusing Carnival of negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress for failing to warn them about reported gang-related violence in the area. ####  ##### A lower court granted Carnival's motion to dismiss the case, saying the complaint's allegations were “conclusory and insufficiently factual.” ####  ##### However, a three-judge appeals court panel overturned that ruling. It said the complaint alleged that a Carnival employee encouraged the family to visit Coki Beach; that Carnival knew of the site's reputation for drug sales, theft and gang violence; and that it knew, or should have known, about the gang member's shooting and funeral because it monitors crime in its ports of call. ####  ##### “The facts alleged in the complaint are plausible and raise a reasonable expectation that discovery could supply additional proof of Carnival's liability,” the panel ruled in overturning the lower court's dismissal of the negligence claim. ####  ##### The panel also reinstated the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, noting the complaint alleges that the family was trapped in the bus during the violence, witnessed Ms. Chaparro's shooting and death, and that they have ""consequently experienced various physical manifestations of their emotional distress.” ####  ##### A Carnival spokeswoman said in an email that the company does not comment on pending litigation, but pointed to its statement after the shooting in which Carnival said it was “profoundly shocked and saddened by this tragedy.” #### "

Motorola Mobility was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### TiVo said Verizon would initially pay $100 million in cash and recurring quarterly payments totaling $150.4 million through July 2018. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### As part of the deal, the companies are discussing having TiVo boxes carry the new Internet video streaming service Verizon is developing with Coinstar Inc.'s Redbox to take on Netflix Inc. TiVo's DVRs already feature video services provided by Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. ####  ##### Besides the guaranteed compensation, Verizon will pay TiVo license fees on a monthly basis through July 2018 for each Verizon DVR subscriber above a certain agreed-upon number. ####  ##### If Verizon and TiVo pursue ""certain commercial initiatives"" by Dec. 21, up to $29.4 million of the payments made by Verizon would be subject to a credit of an equal amount, TiVo said. ####  ##### This probably refers to a nonexclusive deal for Verizon to offer TiVo boxes to customers, according to Mitchell, the Brean Murray analyst. Verizon declined comment on the settlement or future agreements, and it referred questions to TiVo. ####  ##### The companies also agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between them. ####  ##### TiVo shares rose 4.2% to $9.96 in morning trading, while Verizon was down 0.3% at $45.52. #### "

"UnitedHealth to buy most of Brazil's Amil for $4.9 billion ";"Risk Management";"Benefits Management, UnitedHealth Group, Mergers & Acquisitions, Brazil";" ##### (Reuters) — UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would buy a 90% stake in Amil Participacoes S.A., Brazil's largest health insurer and hospital operator, for $4.9 billion, tapping into a fast-growing private health care market as challenges mount for its U.S. business. ####  ##### The deal announced on Monday follows a series of multibillion-dollar takeovers by U.S. health insurers in their home market, including Aetna Inc's $5.6 billion buy of rival Coventry Health Care Inc. and WellPoint Inc.'s planned $4.5 billion purchase of Amerigroup Corp. ####  ##### ""(Brazil's) growing economy, emerging middle class and progressive policies toward managed care make it a high-potential growth market,"" UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said in a statement. ####  ##### U.S. health insurers have come under pressure as the government reins in reimbursement for its Medicaid and Medicare programs for the poor and the elderly and as competition grows among health plans serving employers. ####  ##### The deal with Amil adds to a growing international business at UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer. The company has begun operations or struck alliances in Australia, the Middle East and the U.K. during the past two years. ####  ##### Buying the stake in Amil gives UnitedHealth a chance to test a different model of medical service: Amil offers insurance coverage and also runs hospitals and doctor facilities. While some examples of this already exist in the United States, the largest U.S. insurance companies for the most part operate separately from networks of doctors and other health care providers. ####  ##### ""It's not something UnitedHealth has been willing to do here, but it gives them an opportunity to see how it works,"" said CRT Capital Group analyst Sheryl Skolnick. ""Brazil is a growing economy and gives UnitedHealth more diversification."" ####  ##### UnitedHealth said the deal is expected to slightly increase its 2013 earnings per share. ####  ##### Amil founder and Chief Executive Edson Bueno and partner Dulce Pugliese will retain the remaining 10% stake in the company for at least five years.

"Insurer time-barred from subrogation claim against maker of defective airplane part";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### Too much time has elapsed for United States Aviation Underwriters Inc. to successfully pursue a subrogation claim against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective airplane component, said a federal appellate court in a ruling Tuesday. ####  ##### After an airplane was damaged in a 2009 runway accident, New York-based United States Aviation Underwriters indemnified the aircraft's owner and brought a subrogation claim against Tokyo-based Nabtesco Corp. and Nabtesco Aerospace Inc., according to the ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in United States Aviation Underwriters Inc. v. Nabtesco Corp. ####  ##### A key factor in the ruling is the http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20080120/ISSUE01/100023892 General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, which provides for an 18-year “statute of repose,” which is comparable to a statute of limitations. ####  ##### According to the ruling, on Aug. 17, 2009, a Cessna Citation 560 aircraft was damaged at an airport near Long Beach, Calif., when the nose landing gear collapsed during landing. The collapse allegedly was caused by a defect in the nose landing gear actuator, which is a motor used to extend and retract a plane's front wheels and shock absorbers during takeoff and landing. ####  ##### The actuator had been manufactured by Nabtesco in April 1990 and installed as a new original part on a Cessna 550 aircraft on Oct. 24, 1990. The Cessna was delivered to its first purchaser on Oct. 30, 1990, more than 18 years before the accident. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### At some point, the actuator was removed from the Cessna and installed on the plane that suffered the accident. That plane had been delivered to its first purchaser on Dec. 30, 1991, less than 18 years before the accident. ####  ##### U.S. Aviation filed a subrogation claim for an undisclosed amount against Nabtesco in 2010 for damage to the accident aircraft. It contended in its lawsuit that the date of delivery of the aircraft referred to in the General Aviation legislation refers to the delivery of the accident aircraft in December 1991, which was before the statute of repose expired. ####  ##### But the appellate court disagreed. ####  ##### “We hold that the statute is ambiguous as to whether 'aircraft' refers only to the indivisible delivered plane, or whether it is also includes by reference the component parts of the plane,” said the three-judge panel. ####  ##### “However, our analysis of the legislative history reveals that Congress intended for the latter definition to apply. Thus, under these circumstances, the 'date of delivery of the aircraft' points to the delivery date of the actuator to its first purchaser.” ####  ##### As a result, because the accident occurred after the statute of repose had run, the insurer's claim is barred, said the three-judge panel's ruling, in upholding a lower court's summary judgment dismissing the case. ####  ##### A U.S. Aviation spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"EEOC files suit against Regions Financial Corp. for age, disability discrimination";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a lawsuit against Regions Financial Corp., which does business as Regions Bank, for alleged age and disability discrimination. ####  ##### On behalf of former bank manager Margaret Hardy, the EEOC alleges that Regions Bank failed to provide Ms. Hardy reasonable accommodations for her disability and was fired because of her age, according to the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee in Memphis. ####  ##### In 2010, Ms. Hardy, a branch manager at a bank location in Memphis, was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which caused fatigue and heightened anxiety, and requested a voluntary demotion to a less stressful position. ####  ##### Ms. Hardy was informed that she was unable to take a “step back” in her position because of prior written warning. After a final written warning in 2010, Ms. Hardy was terminated in June 2012, according to court documents. ####  ##### The EEOC alleges that Ms. Hardy, 61, received a less favorable discharge than younger, similarly situated branch managers with written warnings, according to the suit. ####  ##### “Reasonable accommodations allow most people with disabilities to work successfully,” said Katharine W. Kores, the EEOC's director for the Memphis district office, said in a Monday statement. “Further, the EEOC takes special interest when age is used to discriminate against more experienced workers.” ####  ##### The EEOC alleges that Regions Bank violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and seeks monetary damages on behalf of Ms. Hardy, among other damages. ####  ##### Birmingham, Ala.-based Regions Bank, which operates 1,600 banks across 16 states, declined to comment. #### "

"S&P downgrades long-term rating for Mapfre on Spain's fiscal woes";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Spain";" ##### Standard & Poor's Corp. on Tuesday downgraded its long-term rating for Majadahonda, Spain-based Mapfre S.A. insurance group to BBB+ from A-, a day after the ratings firm downgraded the sovereign debt of the Kingdom of Spain to BBB-/A-3 from BBB+/A-2. ####  ##### Peter McClean, London-based director for financial institutions ratings at S&P, said the catalyst behind the decision to downgrade Mapfre was the downgrade of Spain's sovereign debt and that the company's rating was subject to change in the event that the sovereign issue was somehow remediated. ####  ##### “If there is some more positive action on the sovereign debt, we would expect to see that reflected in the rating for Mapfre,” Mr. McClean said. ####  ##### The ratings release from S&P notes several positive financial performance indicators for Mapfre's individual business units. ####  ##### “The ratings on Mapfre's operating entities reflect our view of the group's strong operating performance; increasing geographic diversification, enhanced by leading positions in Spain and Latin America; and track record of good management,” the release states. “We consider these positive factors to be partially offset by the deteriorating credit quality of the investment portfolio, increasing country risk exposure, and weakening capital adequacy levels and quality.” ####  ##### Moreover, Spain's travails likely would not affect insurers domiciled in other parts of the European Union, Mr. McClean said. “This is very much driven by the downgrade on Spain. It doesn't have many implications for countries outside Spain,” he said. ####  ##### Federico Faccio, London-based senior director of insurance for Fitch Ratings Ltd., said the wider implications for insurers are largely on the asset side, as companies operating in the country are obliged to hold some Spanish sovereign debt. ####  ##### “If you look at domestic insurers in Spain, the exposure is high,” Mr. Faccio said. “If you look at more diversified groups, the magnitude of this downgrade of Spanish debt is not sufficient to warrant rating action.” ####  ##### Mr. Faccio also said that companies holding Spanish sovereign debt would need time to adjust their capital holdings. ####  ##### “Assets mixes can be adjusted but only to a certain extent,” he said. #### "

"ING to sell Malaysian insurance unit to AIA for $1.73B";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, AIG, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, China, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### (Reuters) — Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd. has agreed to buy ING Groep N.V.'s Malaysian insurance operations for $1.73 billion in cash, handing the Dutch financial services firm its first deal in a nine-month drive to sell off Asian assets. ####  ##### The sale of the Malaysian unit is expected to be followed soon by the divestment of ING's Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand units, as the bailed-out Dutch financial firm offloads assets to repay €10 billion ($12.89 billion) in state aid received during the 2008 financial crisis. ####  ##### For AIA, the purchase of the Malaysian operations marks its second M&A deal in less than a month and gives it a leading position in the fast-growing Southeast Asian economy. ####  ##### AIA was spun out of U.S. insurer American International Group Inc. in 2010 through a $20.5 billion initial public offering, and Hong Kong-based CEO Mark Tucker has been rebuilding the business after it lost agents and market share amid AIG's near-collapse during the financial crisis. ####  ##### ""It's a good deal, and they are paying up to buy a good-quality business and to expand into a rapidly growing market,"" said Credit Suisse Group analyst Arjan van Veen, describing ING's Malaysian business as the ""jewel in the crown."" ####  ##### AIA said it was paying a multiple of about 1.8 times embedded value for the Malaysian business, compared with AIA's own multiple of 1.5 times. Mr. van Veen said the deal should add 5% to AIA's earnings per share. ####  ##### Embedded value is a measure commonly used to gauge the value of insurance companies and includes the present value of future profit from long-term insurance contracts. ####  ##### The deal, which confirmed a report by Reuters on Wednesday, marks ING's first sale after it announced plans to auction its Asian insurance operations in January as part of a global asset sell-off program. ####  ##### ING originally wanted to sell its entire Asia insurance operation, with a book value of €6.1 billion ($7.86 billion), to one buyer but said it was willing to split up the business if it could raise more money that way. ####  ##### ""Today's announcement is the first major step in the divestment of our Asian insurance and investment management businesses and shows that ING continues to make steady progress in the restructuring of our company,"" said Jan Hommen, chief executive, in a statement. ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian operations attracted bidding interest due to the region's rapid growth potential. Life premiums in Malaysia are forecast to grow at 5.5% next year, compared with a world average of 3.7%, according to Swiss Re Ltd. estimates. ####  ##### The race to buy ING's Japan, Hong Kong and much smaller Thailand operations is still on, with Canada's Manulife Financial Corp. and Hong Kong business tycoon Richard Li in the running, a source told Reuters earlier. ####  ##### KB Financial Group is in advanced talks to buy ING's South Korean operations, sources have told Reuters. ####  ##### AIA said the Malaysian deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would boost its ranking in Malaysia to No. 1 by total premiums. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""ING's business in Malaysia represents an excellent strategic fit with AIA where we already have a well-established and strong business and the ability to integrate ING's businesses with our own,"" AIA CEO Mr. Tucker said in a statement. ####  ##### The deal also would strengthen AIA's bank distribution channel, an area analysts believe AIA needs to beef up. The acquisition will be funded through internal cash resources and debt financing, the statement said. ####  ##### AIA also announced a 22% rise in its value of new business to $300 million. ####  ##### Last month, AIA agreed to buy British insurer Aviva P.L.C.'s Sri Lankan operations for $109 million. ####  ##### ING's Malaysia business sells life, general and Islamic insurance products, and has about 1,200 employees and over 1.6 million customers. ####  ##### ING said it expects a net gain of about €780 million ($1.01 billion) from the transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013. #### "
"Baltimore County pension plan found to discriminate on age ";"Risk Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has won summary judgment in its lawsuit against Baltimore County, Md., that alleged its pension plan is discriminatory based on age. ####  ##### The lawsuit, originally filed in 2007, claimed that Baltimore County's pension plan, known as the Employee Retirement System, violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act by requiring employees 40 years or older to pay higher pension contributions, the EEOC said in a statement Monday. ####  ##### In 2010, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., vacated an entry of summary judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Maryland, Northern Division, in Baltimore, in favor of Baltimore County. The appeals court sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether permissible financial considerations support the pension plan, according to court documents. ####  ##### U.S. District Court Judge Benson Everett Legg last week granted summary judgment against Baltimore County in favor of the EEOC, noting that Baltimore County failed to show financial considerations for requiring older employees to contribute more to the plan that were not based on age. ####  ##### “The county has come forward with no evidence demonstrating why two workers with the same number of years until retirement eligibility should be required to contribute to the ERS at different rates,” the judge wrote. ####  ##### ""The county made older employees pay more than younger employees for the same retirement benefits, without any financial justification,” said EEOC regional attorney Debra Lawrence, in the statement. “Older employees felt the impact of this discrimination in every paycheck.” ####  ##### In its official blog site, Baltimore County said the court’s ruling on age discrimination is wrong and would force employees to pay more, Baltimore County Budget and Finance Director Keith Dorsey wrote. ####  ##### “To put it simply, Baltimore County's retirement contribution schedule is not discriminatory, was negotiated by county labor groups, and is supported by years of sound actuarial studies,” Mr. Dorsey wrote. “For a court to attempt to force Baltimore County to raise the pension contributions for nearly 8,000 county employees retroactively is simply wrong, and the county will stand with its employees and fight this case until there is no one left to fight.” ####  ##### Baltimore County intends to “to vigorously pursue this case and are considering our legal options,” a spokeswoman said in an email. ####  ##### The next phase of litigation will determine damages, the EEOC said. #### "
"Expedia constructing worksite clinic at headquarters";"Risk Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Online travel company Expedia Inc. will offer its employees access to a new worksite clinic at its Bellevue, Wash.-headquarters beginning in January 2013, the company reported. ####  ##### The clinic is being constructed by Qliance Medical Management Inc., a Seattle-based health care firm that contracts with employers to provide primary care to employees and their dependents through its network of clinics. Employers pay Qliance a per-employee per-month fee ranging from $49 to $89 per month, depending on benefit plan members' ages. ####  ##### Qliance will provide Expedia, which self-insures health benefits for approximately 2,000 employees in the Puget Sound area, a customized primary health care solution including women's health services, pediatric care, urgent care, wellness education, ongoing chronic disease management, selected on-site procedures and diagnostics and coordination of all outside specialists and hospital care, according to Dr. Erika Bliss, Qliance president and CEO. ####  ##### The Expedia clinic also will be available to the public and other employers that would like to enroll their employees, Dr. Bliss said. ####  ##### “Employers are struggling to control health care costs. But they don't have a lot of leverage in the community with primary care providers and the rest of the health care system to drive change. If employers can't control the system, (with an on-site clinic) they can at least control the care that is provided within the four walls of their company,” Dr. Bliss said. ####  ##### Dr. Bliss said that when employees have immediate and convenient access to primary care through the workplace, they are less likely to need specialist and emergency room care, thereby lowering employers' health care expenditures. Qliance has saved self-insured businesses up to 30% of the cost of primary care using the clinic model, she said. ####  ##### The Expedia clinic will be the sixth opened by Qliance in Washington state. The company is looking to expand into at least two other states by the end of next year, according to Dr. Bliss. ####  ##### Expedia declined to comment. #### "

"Emergency room physician is independent contractor, cannot pursue bias claims: Court";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A “balance of factors” indicate an emergency room physician was an independent contractor and not an employee, and she therefore cannot pursue her discrimination claims, said a federal appellate court in a ruling Wednesday. ####  ##### Dr. Pooneh Hendi Glascock, a female physician of Iranian origin, had contracted with Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Linn County Emergency Medicine P.C. to provide emergency medical services at Mercy Medical Center in 2007, according to the ruling in Pooneh Hendi Glascock v. Linn County Emergency Medicine P.C. by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. ####  ##### The agreement with the physician group was to last one year and renewed for an additional year unless terminated by either party with 90 days' notice. It provided Dr. Glascock would be offered an ownership position in the firm after one year of satisfactory performance and upon approval by a majority of the firm's owners, said the ruling. ####  ##### The firm provided professional liability insurance for Dr. Glascock, but no benefits or vacation pay. It guaranteed 15 shifts per month and an hourly rate of $130, among other provisions, but gave the physician group no “control or direction over the method or manner” in which she performed her professional services and duties, the ruling said. ####  ##### Dr. Glascock charged that throughout her relationship with the group she was subjected to ongoing sexual harassment by other group physicians, including being called a “princess,” “cutie” and “babe,” as well as disparaging remarks about pregnancy. Group shareholders also allegedly made disparaging remarks about her national origin. ####  ##### At the end of her first year, the clinic's shareholders voted not to extend to her an ownership interest, but instead gave her a six-month probationary term. During the last week of her probationary term, she told the firm she was pregnant, and the shareholders subsequently voted to terminate her. ####  ##### Dr. Glascock filed suit against the group under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Iowa state law, charging discrimination on the basis of sex, pregnancy and national origin. A district court granted the group's motion to dismiss the case. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “To determine whether a hired individual is an employee or an independent contractor, we primarily consider whether the hiring party was able to 'control the manner and means by which a task is accomplished,'” said the 8th Circuit, in quoting the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 ruling in Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Darden. ####  ##### Although evidence supporting the issue of control is “inconclusive” in this case, though, a number of factors in the Darden case “support a conclusion that Glascock was an independent contractor,” said a three-judge panel. Among these was that she received no benefits from the group, paid her own self-employment taxes and was licensed at her own expense.” ####  ##### “Other factors which might favor employee status in this case are fewer in number and less in weight than those favoring independent contractor status,” said the court, in affirming the lower court's ruling dismissing the case. #### "

It’s not even past,” from his 1950 novel “Requiem for a Nun.” ####  ##### In the film, Owen Wilson’s character, a Hollywood screenwriter vacationing in Paris says: “The past is not dead! Actually, it’s not even past. You know who said that? Faulkner. And he was right. And I met him, too. I ran into him at a dinner party.” ####  ##### Charlotte, Va.-based Faulkner Literary Rights alleged copyright infringement on behalf of Sony Pictures, which did not receive permission to use Mr. Faulkner’s words before creating and distributing the film, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### The use of the quote “is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, and/or to deceive (the) film’s viewers as to a perceived affiliation, connection or association between William Faulkner and his works, on the one hand, and Sony, on the other hand,” according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### Sony Pictures reportedly called the lawsuit “frivolous” and will defend itself against the allegations. ####  ##### “There is no question this brief reference — 10 words — to a quote from a public speech Faulkner gave constitutes fair use and any claim to the contrary is without merit,” said Ann Boyd, senior vice president of global communications for Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., in news reports. ####  ##### Faulkner Literary Rights seeks compensatory damages and punitive damages, among others. ####  ##### Mr. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. #### "

"Verdict overturned in University of Southern Mississippi sexual harassment, bias case ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### The Mississippi Supreme Court has overturned a $1.2 million jury verdict against the University of Southern Mississippi in a sexual harassment and gender discrimination case brought by three former coaches of its women's soccer program. ####  ##### The ruling by a three-judge panel in John Mollaghan and John Vincent v. Sonya Varnell and University of Southern Mississippi and Sonya Varnell v. Ged O'Connor was issued last week but announced Monday. ####  ##### Messrs. Vincent and Mollaghan had been women's soccer team coaches at the Hattiesburg, Miss.-based university, while Mr. O'Connor had been a graduate assistant coach. Ms. Varnell is the senior administrator for women's sports for the university. ####  ##### The three men had alleged violation of their due process, sexual harassment, gender discrimination and retaliation, and other charges under various federal and state laws. ####  ##### The men claimed that when Ms. Varnell and Richard Giannini, the university's then-athletic director and another defendant, were named to their positions in 1999, they made it clear they preferred women to coach women's sports. ####  ##### After players complained about the soccer program, Mr. Vincent was reassigned to a teaching position and Messrs. Mollaghan and O'Connor eventually accepted positions elsewhere. ####  ##### The three men filed suit, and a jury awarded Mr. Vincent $500,000, Mr. Mollaghan $376,000 and Mr. O'Connor $300,000 in 2008. ####  ##### The Mississippi Supreme Court held there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict in all three cases. ####  ##### The court's ruling included its analysis of incidents presented by Mr. O'Connor, where he said Ms. Varnell offered him a bed in his hotel and made a comment of “You're so nasty, you're so nasty” after he offered her part of his Subway sandwich. ####  ##### The court said the incidents could not be considered sexual harassment because neither “involved physically threatening conduct nor did they interfere with O'Connor's work performance.” ####  ##### It said also the bed offered by Ms. Varnell was an extra one, and the offer was made after “she heard other coaches teasing O'Connor about spending the night in a hotel room with another man they suspected to be homosexual.” #### "
"Retaliation verdict in HEI Hospitality age bias case upheld on appeal";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### An appellate court affirmed a jury's retaliation verdict against a hotel chain in a case brought by a former executive who was terminated three hours after the company learned he was charging the company with age discrimination, but it reduced the jury's damages award for emotional distress. ####  ##### According to Wednesday's decision by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston in Lawrence Trainor v. HEI Hospitality L.L.C., Mr. Trainor was hired by Norwalk, Conn.-based hotel investment group HEI in 2006, when he was 59. ####  ##### At the time he was hired, Mr. Trainor balked at the firm's requirement that he relocate to Norwalk, Conn., from his Marshfield, Mass., home because of his wife's health. Under a compromise reached at the time, he would spend Mondays and any other days when his presence was needed in Norwalk, and travel to properties that demanded his attention during the rest of the week. ####  ##### In 2008, a new senior vice president of operations was named, and top executives “received an adjuration about a perceived need to relocate to Norwalk,” said the ruling. Mr. Trainor was offered a choice between relocating to Norwalk or becoming a general manager at a lower salary at a Cambridge, Mass., hotel. Negotiations ensued, in which the hotel agreed to give Mr. Trainor a salary higher than the one initially offered if he took the hotel position, but still below his current salary. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On Dec. 4, 2008, his attorney wrote the firm, suggesting it was guilty of age discrimination. On Jan. 2, 2009, Mr. Trainor filed an age discrimination charge with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. He was terminated three hours after the firm was notified of the charge, according to the court ruling. ####  ##### During an eight-day trial, the hotel chain contended the decision to terminate Mr. Trainor's position had been made before Dec. 4. But in April 2011, a jury found HEI liable for retaliation, although not for age discrimination, and awarded Mr. Trainor $500,000 in back pay, $750,000 in front pay and $1 million for emotional distress. The district court reduced the emotional distress award to $500,000. ####  ##### Because the jury determined HEI had knowingly violated state law, the district court entered an order doubling the emotional distress award to $1 million. ####  ##### A three-judge appellate court refused to overturn the liability finding. The court said there was “no smoking gun.” But the “close temporal proximity” between the firm's receipt of the Massachusetts Commission's charge and Mr. Trainor's dismissal “itself supports an inference of retaliation,” said the court. “Because the record supports conflicting versions of the truth, it became the jury's function — not the court's” to choose between the versions of what occurred, the ruling said. ####  ##### However, the appellate court held the basic damages award was excessive. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The ruling said Mr. Trainor and his wife reported that he became withdrawn and had lost interest in activities that had formerly given him pleasure after he was fired. But Mr. Trainor “did not introduce any evidence that he received medical treatment, counseling or other similar attention for his despondency,” the court said. ####  ##### “We do not mean to minimize the toll that the loss of a job can take, even apart from serious health concerns,” said the ruling. “Here, however, the evidence of emotional distress is so thin that the remitted award of $500,000 seems vastly out of proportion,” said the court, which reduced the basic emotional distress award to $200,000. ####  ##### The case was remanded to the district court with directions to vacate the $500,000 award for emotional distress and order a new trial on the issue, unless Mr. Trainor agreed to accept the $200,000 award. ####  ##### Observers have said it is not uncommon for plaintiffs to win retaliation cases, but not on the initial underlying discrimination charge. #### "

Underwriters have revised down the company valuation and the IPO size, sources with direct knowledge of the deal said, underscoring the tough environment for fundraising and PICC's need to boost its capital base to support business growth. ####  ##### People's Insurance Co. (Group) of China, one of China's largest insurers, is tapping the Hong Kong equity market at a time when IPO volumes in the financial center have tumbled more than 80%. PICC will be the biggest Hong Kong IPO since another insurer, AIA Group Ltd., raised $20.5 billion in 2010. ####  ##### The company secured $1.85 billion in commitments from 17 cornerstone investors as varied as Chinese utility State Grid Corp, the country's leading gold miner Zijin Mining Group, defense contractor Spacechina and China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., the sources said. ####  ##### So-called cornerstone investments in IPOs are unique to Asia, where large and well-established investors are guaranteed big allotments in return for holding their shares for a certain period of time, giving investors confidence in the deal. ####  ##### U.S. insurer AIG was added to the list of cornerstone investors who initially signed up, pledging $500 million to the IPO, sources said. It was unclear what caused the delay, but one source had earlier said AIG had dropped out due to valuation issues. AIG was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The list is still subject to last-minute changes, sources said. ####  ##### ""The seller (PICC) is pushing the envelope on valuations,"" one of the sources added. ####  ##### French reinsurer Scor S.E. and Tokio Marine Holdings are among the global companies committed to buy PICC shares.

Comcast and the NHL had no immediate comment. Other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### Michael Buchman, a lawyer representing subscribers, was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### Media companies, leagues and teams can often justify higher costs to watch their products by citing the higher costs of doing business, and that individual teams have rabid followings among viewers willing to pay more to watch events live. ####  ##### The case arose from what the subscribers said were anticompetitive ""blackout"" agreements between service providers such as Comcast and DirecTV, sports networks and the leagues. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### These subscribers contended that if they wanted to watch games from outside their home markets, they were required to buy packages that included all out-of-market games, even if they were interested only in one or a few nonlocal teams. ####  ##### For example, a New York Yankees fan living in Colorado could not pay simply for access to that team's games, but had to buy a product such as the MLB Extra Innings television package. ####  ##### The subscribers sought damages and a halt to arrangements that they said resulted in ""reduced output, diminished product quality, diminished choice and suppressed price competition."" ####  ##### Other packages at issue are NHL Center Ice for television, and MLB.tv and NHL GameCenter LIVE for the Internet. ####  ##### The defendants argued that the subscribers' alleged injuries were only indirectly related to the alleged wrongful conduct, and that Major League Baseball and NHL games did not qualify as ""distinct products"" subject to antitrust scrutiny. ####  ##### Comcast, DirecTV and the sports networks also contended that their conduct was ""presumptively legal."" ####  ##### Judge Scheindlin nonetheless let much of the case go forward. ####  ##### ""Making all games available as part of a package, while it may increase output overall, does not, as a matter of law, eliminate the harm to competition wrought by preventing the individual teams from competing to sell their games outside their home territories in the first place,"" she wrote. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The judge did dismiss claims that Comcast, DirecTV and the sports networks conspired to monopolize markets, while allowing similar claims against Major League Baseball and the NHL to proceed. She also dismissed some individual plaintiffs from the case, saying they lacked standing to sue. ####  ##### ""There will be pressure on the defendants to settle before this gets to trial,"" which could cost ""real money,"" said Geoffrey Rapp, a University of Toledo law professor in Ohio. ####  ##### ""The defendants are in some ways similar to record companies that had to adapt as a la carte options became available online, where people could buy one song rather than a whole album,"" he said. ""Five or 10 years from now, these package-deal arrangements may no longer exist."" ####  ##### Among the dozens of defendants were the Yankees and its YES network; the Chicago White Sox baseball and Chicago Blackhawks hockey teams; the New York Rangers hockey team; and various Comcast SportsNet and RootSports networks. ####  ##### Last month, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it would buy a 49% stake in the YES network. ####  ##### Baseball itself has had an antitrust exemption since 1922, but has long faced periodic calls from Congress and elsewhere that it be repealed. ####  ##### The cases are Laumann et al v. National Hockey League et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-01817; and Garber et al. v.

"Strike settlement to reopen Los Angeles ports to normal freight traffic";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — The United States' largest cargo shipping complex was set to resume full operations on Wednesday after harbor clerks and management settled an eight-day strike that left the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach mostly idle, sapping the region's economy of an estimated $8 billion. ####  ##### The striking clerks reached a tentative contract deal with a group of shippers and terminal operators late Tuesday, with prodding from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a onetime labor activist. ####  ##### Officials for the International Longshore and Warehouse Workers Local 63 said the hundreds of clerical employees who walked off the job Nov. 26, and the thousands of longshoremen who had refused to cross their picket lines, would return to work first thing Wednesday morning. ####  ##### Federal mediators called upon to join negotiations at the mayor's behest showed up at the waterfront community center where talks were being held shortly before the mayor announced the settlement. ####  ##### ""Today, the ILWU voted to approve the contract,"" Mr. Villaraigosa said, standing with smiling members of both negotiating teams. ####  ##### Union officials said they expected the rank and file, who have been without a contract for more than two years, to ratify the new agreement. ####  ##### Details of the pact were not immediately made public. But the mayor and ILWU representatives said the two sides had come to terms on the union's chief concern — control over outsourcing, or the transfer of jobs to workers elsewhere for less pay. ####  ##### What direct role, if any, the mediators played in clinching the deal was unclear. But Mr. Villaraigosa said a key breakthrough came when the union, which had resisted outside intervention, joined management on Tuesday morning in consenting to mediation as a way of spurring the stalled talks. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### At that point, Mr. Villaraigosa told Reuters, ""The employers said, 'Why don't we just do this today,'"" which led to the final round of negotiations and a deal. ####  ##### The union earlier credited the mayor with helping the parties narrow their differences during a marathon bargaining session the night before. ####  ##### The strike cost Southern California, a region still struggling to recover from a prolonged economic slump, an estimated $1 billion a day, including lost wages and the value of cargo rerouted to other ports, the mayor said. ####  ##### It marked the worst cargo traffic disruption at Los Angeles and Long Beach — which together account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. container imports — since a 10-day lockout of longshoremen at several West Coast ports in 2002. ####  ##### The latest dispute forced a shutdown at 10 of the twin ports' 14 container terminals, as some 10,000 longshoremen and other union workers honored the picket lines of the 800-member ILWU clerical workers unit. ####  ##### Four other container terminals remained open, along with facilities for handling shipments of automobiles, liquid fuels and break-bulk cargo such as raw steel. ####  ##### Still, at least 18 freighters bound for Los Angles and Long Beach during the strike changed course to take their cargo to ports in Northern California, Mexico and Panama, according to the nonprofit Maritime Exchange of Southern California. The diverted cargo heightened concerns about the region losing business to competing ports. ####  ##### Many other cargo-laden vessels were forced to line up for days at offshore anchorages, waiting to unload their containers. ####  ##### The chief stumbling block throughout contract negotiations was disagreement over future staffing levels and continued union classification of jobs lost to retirement or other attrition. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Under the agreement, Mr. Villaraigosa told Reuters: ""The employers are not going to outsource."" ####  ##### Union spokesman Craig Merrilees said: ""Really, it was getting control on the outsourcing ... ensuring that the jobs are here today, tomorrow and for the future."" ####  ##### Stephen Berry, chief negotiator for the Harbor Employers Association, representing shippers and terminal operators at the talks, hailed the settlement as ""the end of a very long journey. We're delighted with the terms. We'll be operating again and the cargo will be flowing."" ####  ##### During the dispute, the employers had accused union negotiators of seeking to ""featherbed"" the ranks of clerical workers with more jobs than were necessary. ####  ##### Unlike the labor clash at West Coast ports a decade ago, which took place in the fall, the latest dispute unfolded after the busy pre-holiday shipping season, limiting the scope of its ripple effect. ####  ##### Many major U.S. retailers said they were largely spared any pain from the labor clash because most of their Christmas inventory had already made it to store shelves. ####  ##### But the National Retail Federation asked President Barack Obama last week to intervene, warning a prolonged strike could have a ""devastating impact on the U.S. economy."" ####  ##### The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together handled more than $400 billion in goods arriving or leaving the West Coast by ship last year. Experts say the ports directly or indirectly support 1.2 million Southern California jobs — workers involved in moving freight to or from the shipping complex. #### "
"Insurer not obligated to defend in false marketing suit";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, P/C Insurers";" ##### A federal appeals court affirmed that a sporting goods company's costs in an underlying false marketing lawsuit are excluded from personal and advertising injury coverages within its general liability policy under the failure-to-conform exclusion. ####  ##### A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled unanimously that Cannon Falls, Minn.-based Robinson Outdoors Inc. was not entitled to defense and indemnification costs under its insurance policies from its insurer, Westfield Center, Ohio-based Westfield Insurance Co. ####  ##### Robinson Outdoors marketed and sold hunting-related clothing that would eliminate human scent so that wild game would not detect a hunter's presence. In 2009, the company was hit with class action lawsuits by consumers who had purchased the scent-masking products alleging that the products did not actually eliminate human odor as advertised. ####  ##### A lower court determined that Robinson Outdoors' claims in the underlying lawsuits were excluded by the “failure-to-conform” provision within its advertising injury coverage, which excluded claims “arising out of the failure of goods, products or services to conform with any statement of quality or performance made in (Robinson's) policies,” according to court documents. ####  ##### On appeal, Robinson Outdoors argued that the exclusion was vague. But the three-judge panel said neither the court nor Robinson Outdoors could articulate multiple interpretations of the failure-to-conform exclusion. ####  ##### “Rather, the exclusion clause directly applies to Robinson's conduct — Robinson marketed goods and was then sued because the goods did not conform to promises regarding their performance,” according the opinion. ####  ##### “The failure-to-conform provision in the insurance polices precludes coverage in this case because it captures all of the legal claims asserted by the consumers in the underlying lawsuits,” the Circuit Judge Bobby Shepherd wrote in the opinion filed Friday. “Therefore, the district court correctly held that Westfield was under no obligation to defend or indemnify Robinson in the underlying lawsuits.” #### "

"Female shareholders file class action gender bias lawsuit against Greenberg Traurig";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A putative class action lawsuit was filed Monday against international law firm Greenberg Traurig L.L.P. by current and former female shareholders charging the firm with gender discrimination. ####  ##### The lawsuit, Francine Friedman Griesing v. Greenberg Traurig L.L.P., which was filed by New York-based plaintiff law firm Sanford Heisler L.L.P. in federal district court in New York, seeks $200 million. There are about 215 women in the class, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### It says that the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in June found “reasonable cause to believe” New York-based Greenberg Traurig discriminated against its female attorneys in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act by compensating women less than similarly situated male counterparts and treating class members less favorably than similarly situated male shareholders. ####  ##### The lawsuit states the “glass ceiling remains firmly in place at large law firms,” with a recent American Bar Association study of nationwide law firms finding female attorneys comprise 45% of law firm associates but only 15% of equity partners. It notes that at Greenberg Traurig, the title “shareholder” is the equivalent to the title “partner” at other firms. ####  ##### “Yet even in a field dominated by archaic gender stereotypes, (Greenberg Traurig) stands out for its culture of discrimination against female attorneys,” says the lawsuit, which states only 9.6% of its equity shareholders are female, well below the 15% national average, and the firm ranks 193 out of 221 top law firms in the number of female equity partners, according to a study. ####  ##### The law firm said in a Monday statement, “The lawsuit filed today by Francine Griesing and her attorneys is an affront to the accomplished, talented women of Greenberg Traurig, who, like all of our lawyers, are compensated based on merit. It is nothing more than a financially motivated publicity stunt without merit, backed by neither fact nor law. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Griesing's complaint paints a false picture of the work environment at Greenberg Traurig and the facts surrounding her initial claim to the EEOC. What her press release calls 'the EEOC's rare finding of class-wide discrimination at the firm' were in fact very narrow findings limited to one office and seven women, in a setting in which Ms. Greising was the sole complainant. ####  ##### “Griesing refused to submit her claim to arbitration as required by the firm's shareholder agreement and instead filed in federal court.  Accordingly, today the firm filed a petition in federal court in Philadelphia to compel arbitration. ####  ##### “Greenberg Traurig has an exemplary record of fairness and advancement irrespective or gender, race or creed. Our history of recruiting, retaining, and promoting women and our law firm reflects that. The firm intends to vigorously defend our practices against her lawsuit and we fully expect to prevail.” #### "
"Dillard's to pay $2M to settle class action disability bias lawsuit ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### National retail chain Dillard's Inc. has agreed to pay $2 million to settle a class action disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ####  ##### The settlement resolves a 2008 lawsuit filed against the Little Rock, Ark.-based retailer for allegedly using a longstanding national policy and practice of requiring all employees to disclose personal and confidential medical information to obtain sick leave, the EEOC said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### The settlement also resolves allegations that Dillard's terminated employees for taking sick leave beyond the maximum amount of time allowed. ####  ##### In the suit, the EEOC alleged that since 2005 Dillard's violated Americans with Disabilities Act by requiring former cosmetics counter employee Corina Scott at a store in El Centro, Calif., and others, to disclose the exact nature of their medical conditions to be approved for sick leave. ####  ##### Ms. Scott, who was absent from work for four days, and others, subsequently were fired in retaliation for refusing to provide details of their medical conditions, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. ####  ##### The EEOC also claimed Dillard's enforced a maximum-leave policy that limited the amount medical-related leave an employee could take without regularly determining if more leave was allowed under the ADA. ####  ##### The district court ruled that Dillard's medical disclosure policy was “facially discriminatory under the ADA,” the EEOC said in the statement. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Policies and practices that permit medical inquiries without proof of a valid business necessity run afoul of the law, often having large-scale consequences,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles district office, in the statement. “All employers should carefully examine their own policies and practices to ensure compliance with federal law."" ####  ##### Dillard's agreed to pay $2 million to identified claimants and establish a class fund for unidentified claimants. The agreement also requires Dillard's to review and revise company policies, according to the statement. ####  ##### The two policies that allegedly violated the ADA are not in effect and the company denies that either policy violated the law, Dillard's said in a separate statement Tuesday. ####  ##### “However, in order to avoid further protracted litigation with the EEOC over policies that are no longer in effect, Dillard's determined that the most efficient resolution was to settle with the EEOC,” the company said in the statement. “Under the settlement the company agreed to not reinstate the policies at issue as well as to other injunctive relief, and to establish a class fund from which current and former associates who believe they were adversely affected by the policies can make a claim.” #### "

Protonix, which belongs to a class of widely used medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPI), has since gone off patent and is available in cheap generic versions as pantoprazole. ####  ##### Protonix was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis, a condition related to gastro-esophageal reflux disease, or GERD, that can only be diagnosed via endoscopy. ####  ##### The Justice Department accused Wyeth of training its sales force to promote Protonix for all forms of GERD, which is far more common and likely to lead to significantly higher sales. ####  ##### ""Wyeth tried to cheat the system by obtaining a limited FDA approval for Protonix, fully intending to promote this drug for additional, unapproved uses,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a statement. ####  ##### In addition, Wyeth allegedly promoted Protonix as the ""best PPI for nighttime heartburn,"" even though there was never any clinical evidence that it was more effective than any other PPI, such as AstraZeneca's Nexium, for that use, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### Pfizer issued a statement saying that it was not the target or subject of this case, but felt that settling it was in its best interest. ####  ##### ""Resolving this investigation regarding Wyeth's historical promotional practices of Protonix is the right thing to do,"" the company said. ""In settling, we avoid both the cost and distraction of litigation and we expressly deny the allegations of wrongdoing."" #### "
"KBW predicts modest rate increases for P/C insurers in 2013";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### Modest rate increases but little improvement in underlying underwriting profitability are likely to continue for the property/casualty insurance industry in 2013, according to an analysis released Wednesday by Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. ####  ##### The industry remains overcapitalized despite increased shareholder dividends, share repurchases and increased catastrophe losses, said KBW in “2013 Outlook: More of the Same, Slow Firming Continues.” The report added that KBW expects investment results to be under pressure for the foreseeable future, and “while underlying underwriting results may slowly improve going forward due to modest rate increases that are in excess of loss costs trends, we expect favorable prior-year reserve development to wane.” ####  ##### The report says the “long-sought-after hard market will remain elusive” until excess capital is eliminated and insurers face balance sheet pressure. While the current firming “should keep things heading in the right direction,” the industry would have to experience significant balance sheet erosion before the market truly hardens. ####  ##### The report also says underwriting is key to insurers' success in the current environment. “Strong underwriters are able to generate good results regardless of where we are in the underwriting cycle,” said KBW. #### "

The FSA declined to comment. ####  ##### U.S. and European banks have now agreed to settlements with U.S. regulators totaling some $5 billion in recent years on charges they violated U.S. sanctions and failed to police potentially illicit transactions. ####  ##### No bank or bank executives, however, have been indicted, as prosecutors have instead used deferred prosecutions — under which criminal charges against a firm are set aside if it agrees to conditions such as paying fines and changing behavior. ####  ##### HSBC's settlement also includes agreements or consent orders with the Manhattan district attorney, the Federal Reserve and three U.S. Treasury Department units: the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ####  ##### HSBC said it would pay $1.921 billion, continue to cooperate fully with regulatory and law enforcement authorities, and take further action to strengthen its compliance policies and procedures.

Yes. Is it significant? Yes. But in the absence of a broader attack on the business structure or individuals, that explains why the market reaction has been relatively muted today and has been since the allegations came out,"" he added. ####  ##### HSBC said it had increased spending on anti-money laundering systems by around nine times between 2009 and 2011, exited business relationships and clawed back bonuses for senior executives. It cited the hiring last January of Stuart Levey, a former top U.S. Treasury Department official, as chief legal officer as evidence of its determination to change. ####  ##### Under a five-year agreement with the Justice Department, HSBC agreed to have an independent monitor evaluate its progress in improving its compliance. ####  ##### It also said that as part of the overhaul of its controls, it has launched a global review of its ""Know Your Customer"" files, which will cost an estimated $700 million over five years. The files are designed to ensure that banks do not unwittingly act as conduits for criminal funds. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### HSBC's settlement comes a day after rival British bank Standard Chartered P.L.C. agreed to a $327 million settlement with U.S. law enforcement agencies for sanctions violations, a pact that follows a $340 million settlement the bank reached with the New York bank regulator in August. ####  ##### Such settlements have become commonplace. In what had been the largest settlement until this week, ING Bank N.V. in June agreed to pay $619 million to settle U.S. government allegations that it violated sanctions against countries including Cuba and Iran. ####  ##### Other banks that have reached settlements over sanctions violations are Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group, Britain's Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays P.L.C., and ABN Amro Holding N.V., a Dutch bank acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland Group P.L.C. and a bank consortium in 2007. ####  ##### In the United States, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wachovia Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have been cited for anti-money laundering lapses or sanctions violations. ####  ##### HSBC's failings date to 2003, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and New York state regulators ordered it to better monitor suspicious money flows. In 2010, a consent order from the Comptroller of the Currency ordered HSBC to review suspicious transactions. At the time, the OCC called HSBC's compliance programe ""ineffective."" ####  ##### In 2008, the U.S. Attorney in Wheeling, W.Va., began investigating allegations that a local doctor used the bank to launder money from Medicare fraud. ####  ##### Ultimately, that prosecutor's office came to believe the case was ""the tip of the iceberg"" in terms of suspicious transactions conducted through HSBC, according to documents reviewed by Reuters and reported earlier this year. #### "

However, the substitute items Mr. Probert received were worth far less, the suit claims. They included a Christmas tree figurine and minifigure magnet, both of which retail for less than $5, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, was filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut the day after Thanksgiving by the Collingswood-based law firm Shepherd Finkelman Miller & Shah L.L.P.

"Toyota seeks to settle acceleration case for $1.1B";"Risk Management";"Asia-Pacific & Australasia";" ##### (Reuters) — Toyota Motor Corp. has agreed to spend $1.1 billion to settle sweeping U.S. class action litigation over claims that millions of its vehicles accelerate unintentionally, as the Japanese automaker seeks to move past the biggest safety crisis in its history. ####  ##### Shares of Toyota rose nearly 3% in Tokyo following the news, with some investors saying the settlement removed one uncertainty for the company and looked manageable given its improving sales outlook and a weaker yen. ####  ##### The proposed settlement will compensate customers for economic losses related to possible safety defects in Toyota vehicles, covering most of the litigation involving unintended acceleration, although it does not cover claims for wrongful death or injuries. ####  ##### About 16 million Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles sold in the United States spanning the model years 1998 to 2010 are covered by the action, according to court filings made public on Wednesday. Thirty nameplates are affected, including the top-selling Toyota Camry midsize sedan and Corolla compact car. ####  ##### Toyota, the No. 3 automaker in the U.S. market, admitted no fault in proposing the settlement, one of the largest of U.S. mass class action litigation in the automotive sector. ####  ##### ""This was a difficult decision, especially since reliable scientific evidence and multiple independent evaluations have confirmed the safety of Toyota's electronic throttle control systems,"" Christopher Reynolds, general counsel for Toyota Motor Sales, USA, said in a statement. ####  ##### ""However, we concluded that turning the page on this legacy legal issue through the positive steps we are taking is in the best interests of the company, our employees, our dealers and, most of all, our customers."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The figure eclipses other settlements in the auto industry including Bridgestone Corp.'s $240 million payout to Ford Motor Co. in 2005 over Ford's massive Firestone tire safety recall in 2001. Ford replaced 13 million Firestone tires, installed mostly as original equipment on the company's popular Explorer SUV, in one of the biggest recalls in U.S. history. ####  ##### Hagens Berman, the law firm representing Toyota owners who brought the lawsuit in 2010, issued a statement saying that the settlement was valued between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In a memo filed in court, the lawyers said the settlement was ""a landmark, if not a record, settlement in automobile defect class action litigation in the United States."" ####  ##### Toyota said it would take a one-time pretax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the costs. The company said it planned to book the charge as operating expenses in its October-December third quarter. ####  ##### ""This is positive, as it removes the factor that was the biggest concern when it came to lawsuits ... Because Toyota's absolute numbers are very big when it comes to profits, it's hardly going to have an impact,"" said Koji Endo, an autos analyst at Advanced Research in Tokyo. ####  ##### Toyota may be able to offset costs with a rise in its profits as the yen weakens, he added. Toyota's operating profit increases by 35 billion yen for every one-yen rise in the value of the dollar. The automaker has forecast an operating profit of 1.05 trillion yen ($12.3 billion) for the financial year ending in March 2013. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Toyota shares rose 2.7%, compared with a 1% rise in Japan's benchmark Nikkei index. ####  ##### Toyota's recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011 hurt the company's reputation for reliability and safety. ####  ##### The effect of the recalls on sales and loyalty remains ""difficult to isolate,"" IHS Automotive analyst Rebecca Lindland said. ####  ##### ""A lot of their growth through the early 2000s were first-time Toyota buyers,"" she said. ""Those are the people that were most vulnerable to saying, 'I'll never own a Toyota again.' The long-term effects won't fully be realized until all of the cars that have been impacted by the recall have been retired."" ####  ##### The biggest safety crisis in Toyota's history began to get public notice in August 2009 when an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer Mark Saylor and three members of his family were killed in a Lexus ES 350 that crashed at a high speed. ####  ##### A separate lawsuit over the death of the Saylor family was settled out of court. A handful of wrongful death and personal injury cases are still pending, but the vast majority of the litigation over unintended acceleration will be finished if the proposed settlement is approved, said a person with knowledge of the remaining lawsuits who wished to remain anonymous. ####  ##### Within a half year of the Saylor family crash, Toyota President Akio Toyoda and other company executives were questioned in a high-profile U.S. Congressional hearing, and Toyoda made a public apology. ####  ##### Toyota maintained all along that its electronic throttle control system was not at fault, and reiterated that on Wednesday. It has blamed ill-fitting floor mats and sticky gas pedals for the problem. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A study by U.S. safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NASA found no link between the reports of unintended acceleration and Toyota's electronic throttle control system. ####  ##### The settlement, which must be approved by a California federal judge, includes direct payments to customers as well as the installation of a brake override system in more than 2.7 million vehicles, according to the settlement agreement filed in court. ####  ##### The terms include a $250 million fund for former Toyota owners who sold vehicles at reduced prices and a separate $250 million fund for owners not eligible for the brake override system. ####  ##### Attorneys for the plaintiffs are slated to receive up to $200 million in fees and $27 million in costs, according to court documents. ####  ##### Richard Cupp, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said the settlement was large for the automotive sector but was dwarfed by other litigation involving economic loss claims. State cases against the tobacco industry, for instance, amounted to more than $200 billion. ####  ##### ""That could mean that lawsuits like these could become increasingly common, even where there is not provable physical injury on large scale,"" Mr. Cupp said. ####  ##### The case is In re: Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 10-ml-02151. #### "
"Eli Lilly to pay $29M to settle SEC bribery case";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co. agreed on Thursday to pay $29 million to settle civil charges that its subsidiaries made improper payments to foreign government officials to win business in Russia, Brazil, China and Poland. ####  ##### Lilly's settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission represents part of a broader bribery crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry by U.S. criminal and civil authorities as they continue to probe corruption. ####  ##### The settlement stems from an investigation by the SEC of Lilly's activities from 1994 to 2009, Lilly said, adding the company was first notified of the probe in 2003. ####  ##### In this case, the SEC alleged that a Russian unit of Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly used ""marketing agreements"" to funnel millions of dollars to government officials through offshore companies. ####  ##### Eli Lilly, whose products include schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa and the depression drug Cymbalta, agreed to the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying the charges. ####  ##### The SEC said that when Eli Lilly became aware of possible violations of the law that bans bribing government officials it did not intervene on the use of the marketing agreements for more than five years. Moreover, the SEC said the company's units in Brazil, China and Poland made improper payments to government officials or third-party firms associated with government officials. ####  ##### ""Eli Lilly and its subsidiaries possessed a 'check the box' mentality when it came to third-party due diligence,"" said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, head of the SEC enforcement unit that specializes in bribery cases. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""Companies can't simply rely on paper-thin assurances by employees, distributors, or customers. They need to look at the surrounding circumstances of any payment to adequately assess whether it could wind up in a government official's pocket."" ####  ##### Eli Lilly in a statement said that in addition to paying $29.4 million, it agreed to have an independent compliance consultant conduct a 60-day review of its internal controls and FCPA compliance. ####  ##### ""Lilly requires our employees to act with integrity with all external parties and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,"" said Anne Nobles, Lilly's chief ethics and compliance officer. ####  ##### Nobles said Lilly had cooperated with the U.S. investigators and strengthened its internal controls, including significant investment in a global anti-corruption program. ####  ##### Under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is illegal for U.S. companies and foreign firms with listed U.S. stock to bribe government officials. ####  ##### In February, a review by Reuters showed that eight of the world's top 10 drug makers, including Eli Lilly, had all warned investors they could face liabilities related to corruption charges in overseas markets. ####  ##### Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay $60 million this year to settle FCPA charges and Johnson & Johnson reached a $70 million settlement last year. ####  ##### Pfizer is on track to record $10 billion in sales from emerging markets this year, while J&J said Brazil, Russia, India and China accounted for just under 10 percent of the $65 billion in sales it reported last year. ####  ##### Some experts say the kinds of fines paid for FCPA infractions may not be a great deterrent to big companies, which are relying increasingly on sales in emerging markets. ####  ##### The law firm Shearman & Sterling, which puts out a semi-annual report tracking FCPA enforcement, found that penalties across all industries have averaged less than $20 million. #### "

"Marine reinsurance rates rise amid generally stable market: Willis Re";"Risk Management";"Agents & Brokers, Willis Group";" ##### Although rates for property reinsurance remained generally stable at the Jan. 1 renewal, rates for marine business rose sharply, according to a study by Willis Re, the reinsurance arm of London-based brokerage Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. ####  ##### According to the study, released Monday, U.S. rates for property catastrophe business were flat or down by 5%, on average, on loss-free accounts. Accounts that suffered losses in 2012 saw rate increases of up to 10%, according to the report. ####  ##### A number of large accounts that suffered losses from Superstorm Sandy do not renew until later in the year, the report noted. ####  ##### For international property catastrophe business, rates were flat or down by as much as 5%, on average, the report said. ####  ##### “In the absence of Superstorm Sandy, reinsurers would have found it difficult to resist buyer pressure for further concessions,” said Peter Hearn, chairman of Willis Re, and John Cavanagh, CEO of Willis Re, in the report. “As such, Sandy's impact has helped to stabilize market pricing on an overall basis, and reinsurers have largely delivered to their clients in terms of capacity and continuity,” they said. ####  ##### Marine reinsurance buyers are seeing rate increases of 15% and higher even on loss-free offshore energy excess-of-loss contracts after a “difficult year” for the marine market, which suffered losses from Superstorm Sandy, the loss of the cruise ship Costa Concordia in January 2012 and a deterioration in losses stemming from the October 2011 M.V. Rena oil spill off the coast of New Zealand, among other things, according to the report. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Many marine insurance buyers have increased their retentions to help offset the impact of rate increases, the report noted. ####  ##### Renewals for marine business were very late, partly because of uncertainty over Superstorm Sandy losses, according to the report. ####  ##### Rates for marine insurance buyers that are members of Protection and Indemnity Clubs are likely to see rate increases of a minimum of 10% when that business renews on Feb. 20, with the reinsurance program purchased by the International Group of P&I Clubs subject to a rate hike of more than 40%, according to the report. ####  ##### The report is available here. #### "

"U.S. government warns on Java as security concerns escalate";"Risk Management";"Tech Insights";" ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security urged computer users to disable Oracle Corp.'s Java software, amplifying security experts' prior warnings to the hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses that use it to surf the Web. ####  ##### Hackers have figured out a way to exploit Java to install malicious software enabling them to commit crimes ranging from identity theft to making an infected computer part of an ad-hoc network of computers that can be used to attack websites. ####  ##### ""We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,"" the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team said in a posting on its website late on Thursday. ####  ##### ""This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered,"" the agency said. ""To defend against this and future Java vulnerabilities, disable Java in Web browsers."" ####  ##### Java is a computer language that enables programmers to write software utilizing just one set of code that will run on virtually any type of computer, including ones that use Microsoft Corp.'s Windows, Apple Inc.'s OS X and Linux, an operating system widely employed by corporations. ####  ##### Computer users access Java programs through modules, or plug-ins, that run Java software on top of browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. ####  ##### The U.S. government's warning on Java came after security experts earlier on Thursday warned of the newly discovered flaw. ####  ##### It is relatively rare for government agencies to advise computer users to completely disable software due to a security bug, particularly in the case of widely used programs such as Java. They typically recommend taking steps to mitigate the risk of attack while manufacturers prepare an update, or hold off on publicizing the problem until an update is prepared. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In September, the German government advised the public to temporarily stop using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to give it time to patch a security vulnerability that opened it to attacks. ####  ##### The Department of Homeland Security said that attackers could trick targets into visiting malicious websites that would infect their PCs with software capable of exploiting the bug in Java. ####  ##### It said that an attacker could also infect a legitimate website by uploading malicious software that would infect machines of computer users who trust that site because they have previously visited it without experiencing any problems. ####  ##### They said developers of several popular tools known as exploit kits, which criminal hackers use to attack PCs, have added software that allows hackers to exploit the newly discovered bug in Java to attack computers. ####  ##### Security experts have been scrutinizing the safety of Java since a similar security scare in August, which prompted some of them to advise using the software only on an as-needed basis. ####  ##### At the time they advised businesses to only allow their workers to use Java browser plug-ins when prompted for permission by trusted programs such as GoToMeeting, a Web-based collaboration tool from Citrix Systems Inc. ####  ##### Adam Gowdiak, a researcher with Polish security firm Security Explorations, subsequently said that he had found other security bugs in Java that continued to make computers vulnerable to attack. ####  ##### Java suffered another setback in October when Apple began removing old versions of the software from Internet browsers of Mac computers when its customers installed new versions of its OS X operating system. Apple did not provide a reason for the change and both companies declined comment at the time. #### "
"Burger King franchisee Carrols settles EEOC harassment suit for $2.5M ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Carrols Corp., the world's largest Burger King Corp. franchisee, has agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit first brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1998. ####  ##### The president of the Syracuse, N.Y.-based company, which operates more than 572 Burger King restaurants, said in a statement that it only agreed to the settlement because it was less costly than continuing to pursue litigation. ####  ##### The EEOC on Tuesday said the lawsuit had alleged discrimination against 89 female employees at Burger King locations throughout the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast. The agency said the alleged harassment — which ranged from obscene comments, jokes and propositions to unwanted touching, exposure of genitalia, strip searches, stalking and rape — was perpetrated by managers in most cases. ####  ##### The EEOC said the company retaliated against some of the women by cutting their hours, manufacturing discipline against them and firing them, while it forced more women to quit because the harassment made their working conditions intolerable. ####  ##### To settle the litigation, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Syracuse, Carrols will pay $2.5 million in compensatory damages and lost wages to the 89 women and implement measures that include increasing employees' awareness of Carrols' anti-harassment policies, the EEOC said. ####  ##### “As this case demonstrates, the EEOC will persist in enforcing the legal prohibitions against harassment until the matter is resolved,” EEOC general counsel P. David Lopez said in a statement. “Although employers may have adequate anti-harassment policies on paper, they are of little value when employers fail to take positive steps to prevent or remedy harassment. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Employers must make sure employees know about the policies and then they must respond effectively when complaints are brought forward,” Mr. Lopez said. ####  ##### Carrols said in a statement that the EEOC had unsuccessfully sought to establish a class action based on a claim of “pattern or practice” across its restaurants in 13 states, and that court rulings left “only a relative handful of claims to be resolved and a vindication of Carrols' longstanding written policies and procedures.” ####  ##### “We unequivocally do not tolerate sexual harassment in our workplace and have resolved this litigation without any admission of wrongdoing after many years of intensive, costly and frustrating litigation with the EEOC,” Daniel T. Accordino, CEO of Carrols Restaurant Group Inc., a unit of Carrols Corp., said in the statement, ####  ##### “At Carrols, we take sexual harassment very seriously and have long had comprehensive procedures and processes in place to encourage our employees to report violations to our policies and to do so without fear of retaliation. We also have a long history of thoroughly investigating employee complaints and terminating employees who have harassed others.” ####  ##### Mr. Accordino added, “We agreed to this negotiated settlement at this stage of the litigation simply because the settlement payment we've agreed to make is far less than the cost and expense we would incur to continue to litigate each of the remaining individual claims to conclusion given the age of the claims and because hundreds of potential witnesses were now, after 14 years, in scattered locations across the country, ill or deceased. ####  ##### “Our agreement with the EEOC to continue, and in limited circumstances, enhance our best practices on harassment prevention and training confirms our commitment to providing a workplace with equal opportunity and free from sexual harassment.” #### "

"Still no timetable for returning Boeing 787 to flight";"Risk Management";"European Union, Risk Management, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Middle East/Africa, Switzerland, India";" ##### (Reuters) — Japanese regulators have joined their U.S. counterparts in all but ruling out overcharged batteries as the cause of recent fires on the Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner, which has been grounded for a week with no end in sight. ####  ##### Solving the battery issue has become the primary focus of the investigation, though the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday there are still no firm answers as to the cause and no clear timetable yet for returning the plane to flight. ####  ##### Meanwhile, as deliveries of the cutting-edge passenger jet back up, a key Chinese customer lamented the delays and said its growth plans were being hampered by its inability to get the planes on time. ####  ##### Regulators grounded the Dreamliner on Jan. 16 after a series of safety incidents, including battery fires on planes in the United States and Japan. The Japanese incident forced a plane to make an emergency landing. ####  ##### Last weekend the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said the fire on a Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. 787 in Boston was not due to excess voltage, and on Wednesday, Japanese officials all but ruled it out for the incident on an All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. plane there. ####  ##### ""On the surface, it appears there was no overcharging,"" said Norihiro Goto, chairman of the Japan Transport Safety Board, at a media briefing. ####  ##### ""The fact that such electrical system-related incidents would occur consecutively, purely from my perspective, could not have been expected. We are finding it difficult trying to figure out what kind of investigative stance we should take."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The investigation has also renewed scrutiny on the FAA's 2007 decision to let Boeing use a highly flammable battery technology on the 787. A U.S. Senate committee will hold a hearing in coming weeks to examine aviation safety oversight and the FAA's decision, a congressional aide said on Tuesday. ####  ##### While the NTSB and JTSB hunt for a solution to the battery question, there is also an open issue around fuel leaks on the Dreamliner. In early December, U.S. officials warned of a manufacturing fault with fuel lines, and this month a JAL plane in Boston leaked before takeoff. ####  ##### Industrial manufacturer Eaton Corp. said Wednesday it was cooperating with investigators looking at the fuel leaks. ####  ##### ""Without speaking about either the incident or investigation, I can tell you that we do supply pumps and valves to the program,"" a spokeswoman said. ####  ##### The 787 program was already years behind schedule before last week's grounding, which means Boeing cannot deliver newly manufactured planes to customers. Boeing's chief 787 engineer, Mike Sinnett, told an aviation conference in Dublin he could not say when that would change. ####  ##### ""I can't really say anything about the timeframe of the investigation. The NTSB is really the only authorized authority in the U.S. to talk about this investigation and they made some recent statements, but I can't speculate on timeframe,"" Mr. Sinnett said Wednesday in recorded remarks supplied to Reuters. ####  ##### U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the country's top transportation official, said Wednesday the goal was to return the 787 to service as soon as possible but that the government would not rush the plane back either. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""We are working diligently with Boeing to figure out the problem and find a solution. Our goal is to get this done as quickly as possible, but we must be confident that the problems are solved before we can move forward,"" Mr. LaHood told the Aero Club of Washington, an aviation advocacy group. ####  ##### FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, appearing at the same event, said the review was looking at the 787's certification, manufacturing and assembly processes, and that he could not speculate on an end date. ####  ##### For at least one Chinese customer, the uncertainty about the Dreamliner's production and delivery schedule has meant delays in launching new routes. ####  ##### ""Frankly, it's a little disappointing the aircraft has been delayed so many times,"" said Chen Feng, chairman of Hainan Airlines Co. Ltd. parent HNA Group, in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We still think it's a good aircraft, but this has had some effect on our planning."" ####  ##### Hainan has 10 of the planes on order. ####  ##### The grounding of the Dreamliner, an advanced carbon-composite plane with a list price of $207 million, has already forced Japan's ANA to cancel 151 domestic and 26 international flights scheduled for Jan. 23-28, affecting more than 21,000 passengers, the airline said on Monday. ####  ##### ANA, which flies the most Dreamliners of any airline, is due to announce further flight cancellation plans on Thursday. ####  ##### Boeing has already delivered 50 of the 787s to date. Around half of those have been in operation in Japan, but airlines in India, South America, Poland, Qatar and Ethiopia, as well as United Airlines in the United States, are also flying the plane. ####  ##### Boeing's main competitor, EADS, said on Wednesday it did not expect the problems with the 787 to affect the certification of its own rival plane, the Airbus A350. ####  ##### ""We will do what is needed to avoid the same problems,"" EADS strategy chief Marwan Lahoud told France's Radio Classic. ####  ##### Airbus has said it hopes to achieve the maiden flight of the carbon-composite A350 by the middle of this year. #### "

""But it will send a message that the NFL needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations."" ####  ##### An NFL spokesman, Greg Aiello, told Reuters the league's attorneys would review the lawsuit and respond to the claims appropriately through the court. ####  ##### Mr. Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Chargers and two other teams, died in May 2012 after shooting himself in the chest at his beachfront house in his hometown of Oceanside, Calif. ####  ##### A study by a team of independent researchers released this month found that Mr. Seau, 43, suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE — the same debilitating brain disease diagnosed in at least two other former NFL players who committed suicide. ####  ##### The NFL previously has said the result of the examination of Mr. Seau's brain underscored ""the recognized need for additional research to accelerate a fuller understanding of CTE."" NFL clubs have already committed a $30 million research grant to the National Institutes of Health. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Increased awareness and knowledge about brain injuries have unsettled the National Football League, a $9 billion a year industry. The league has attempted to institute rule changes protecting player safety while still preserving the spectacle that fans enjoy, which is partly based on the speed and power of the athletes colliding with one another. ####  ##### Several thousand former NFL players have sued the NFL in federal court in Philadelphia, accusing the league of fraudulently concealing from players the risk of brain injury in playing professional football. ####  ##### Just weeks before Mr. Seau shot himself, former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling committed suicide, and family members described a long descent into dementia after his retirement from the NFL. An autopsy revealed indications of CTE. ####  ##### In February 2011, four-time Pro Bowl safety Dave Duerson, who played most of his career with the Chicago Bears, shot himself in the chest. In a suicide note, he donated his brain for study, and it was found to exhibit signs of CTE. ####  ##### CTE, once known as boxer's dementia, is caused by repeated impacts to the brain, and has been found in athletes who suffered head injuries as well as members of the armed forces with concussive injuries from blast waves. ####  ##### Because the mild and moderate brain injuries do not show up on CT scans or other imaging, the condition can be definitively diagnosed only through an autopsy. #### "
"Creditors probe meningitis-linked pharmacy owners' pay";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — Creditors of the bankrupt pharmacy linked to a deadly U.S. meningitis outbreak are investigating $16 million in salary and shareholder distributions made to company owners in 2012, a lawyer for the group said on Tuesday. ####  ##### Some of the transfers from the New England Compounding Center, which had 2012 sales of $32.4 million, came after the discovery last fall of the meningitis outbreak that has killed 44 people, according to documents filed Friday. ####  ##### ""The bottom line is that instead of using the money to remedy the pharmacy's problems, which now look like a ticking time bomb, they took the money out,"" said David Molton, a lawyer at Brown Rudnick L.L.P., which is representing the official committee of unsecured creditors in NECC's bankruptcy. ####  ##### The unsecured creditors committee, which includes victims of the meningitis outbreak, plans to meet on Tuesday to discuss whether the payments to insiders were proper. ####  ##### Bankruptcy law allows creditors to go back two years before the Chapter 11 filing and claw back transfers and payouts deemed improper, or ""fraudulently conveyed,"" Mr. Molton said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### NECC owner Carla Conigliaro, the largest shareholder in the privately held company, received nearly $9 million in 2012, according to court papers. ####  ##### NECC also paid about $18,000 on her American Express card for purchases from gas stations, restaurants, the Apple Store and other places. ####  ##### Barry Cadden, NECC's chief pharmacist, received about $3.2 million in 2012, filings show. His wife, Lisa Cadden, received about $2.8 million. Greg Conigliaro, a recycling entrepreneur who is Lisa Cadden's brother and Carla Conigliaro's brother-in-law, received about $1.6 million. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The filings also showed that Framingham, Mass.-based NECC had made lease payments for a 2012 BMW X5 and 2011 Mercedes Benz GL-550. NECC paid, for example, $1,251 a month for Carla Conigliaro's Mercedes Benz lease payment, court papers show. ####  ##### Brown Rudnick L.L.P., in a statement, said NECC had paid a total of more than $21 million to the pharmacy's four primary owners and other insiders. ####  ##### Medical Sales Management, which shares some common ownership with NECC, received more than $4 million from NECC in 2012, court papers show. ####  ##### A spokesman for NECC did not return a telephone call seeking comment. ####  ##### NECC filed for bankruptcy protection last month after U.S. authorities shut down its pharmacy operations amid a meningitis outbreak that has killed 44 people and sickened 678 others, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. ####  ##### NECC shipped thousands of vials of a fungus-tainted steroid to medical facilities throughout the United States, according to authorities. #### "
"Dreamliner probe widens after excess battery voltage ruled out";"Risk Management";"Asia-Pacific & Australasia";" ##### (Reuters) — U.S. safety investigators on Sunday ruled out excess voltage as the cause of a battery fire this month on a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner jet operated by Japan Airlines Co. and said they were expanding the probe to look at the battery's charger and the jet's auxiliary power unit. ####  ##### Last week, governments across the world grounded the Dreamliner while Boeing halted deliveries after a problem with a lithium-ion battery on a second 787 plane, flown by All Nippon Airways Co., forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing in western Japan. ####  ##### A growing number of investigators and Boeing executives are working around the clock to determine what caused the two incidents, which the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says released flammable chemicals and could have sparked a fire in the plane's electrical compartment. ####  ##### There are still no clear answers about the root cause of the battery failures, but the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board's statement eliminated one possible answer that had been raised by Japanese investigators. ####  ##### It also underscored the complexity of investigating a battery system that includes manufacturers across the world, and may point to a design problem with the battery that could take longer to fix than swapping out a faulty batch of batteries. ####  ##### ""Examination of the flight recorder data from the JAL B-787 airplane indicates that the APU (auxiliary power unit) battery did not exceed its designed voltage of 32 volts,"" the NTSB said in a statement issued early Sunday. ####  ##### On Friday, a Japanese safety official had told reporters that excessive electricity may have overheated the battery in the ANA-owned Dreamliner that was forced to make the emergency landing at Japan's Takamatsu airport last week. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""The NTSB wanted to set the record straight,"" said one source familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. ####  ##### U.S. investigators already have examined the lithium-ion battery that powered the APU, where the battery fire started in the JAL plane, as well as several other components removed from the airplane, including wire bundles and battery management circuit boards, the NTSB statement said. ####  ##### On Tuesday, investigators will convene in Tucson, Ariz., to test and examine the charger for the battery, and to download nonvolatile memory from the APU controller, with similar tests planned at the Phoenix facility where the APUs are built. Other components have been sent for download or examination to Boeing's Seattle facility and manufacturer facilities in Japan. ####  ##### Securaplane Technologies Inc., a unit of Britain's Meggitt P.L.C. that makes the charger, said it will fully support the U.S. investigation. ####  ##### Officials with United Technologies Corp., which builds the plane's auxiliary power unit and is the main supplier of electrical systems on the 787, said they would also cooperate with the investigation. ####  ##### The NTSB's decision to travel to Securaplane's facility sparked fresh questions about the safety of the lithium-ion batteries that remain at the heart of the investigation. ####  ##### While the 787 is the most aggressive user of lithium-ion battery technology in commercial aviation, the industry at large is testing it, and the FAA has approved its use in several different planes, each governed by ""special conditions."" ####  ##### ""Lithium-ion batteries are significantly more susceptible to internal failures that can result in self-sustaining increases in temperature and pressure,"" the FAA said in 2006, when it allowed Airbus to use lithium batteries for the emerging lighting system on its A380. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Securaplane, which first began working on the charger in 2004, suffered millions of dollars of damages in November 2006 after a lithium-ion battery used in testing exploded and sparked a fire that burned an administrative building to the ground. ####  ##### Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said an investigation into the 2006 fire was later determined to have been caused by an improper test setup, not the battery design. He declined comment on the current 787 investigations. ####  ##### After the fire, a former Securaplane employee named Michael Leon sued the company, alleging that he was fired for raising security concerns about the charger and discrepancies between their assembly documents and the finished chargers. ####  ##### Mr. Leon's suit was later dismissed. ####  ##### The FAA on Sunday said it had investigated Mr. Leon's safety complaints in 2008 and 2009 but concluded his allegations focused on prototypes that were not ultimately used in the new lightweight airliner. ####  ##### FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the reviews also found that Securaplane's production of a particular printed circuit board complied with FAA requirements. ####  ##### Japan's GS Yuasa Corp. makes lithium-ion batteries for the Dreamliner, while France's Thales produces the control systems for the battery. Thales has declined comment. ####  ##### In its statement, the NTSB said French authorities were also participating in the investigation. No comment was immediately available from the French safety agency. ####  ##### The Japan Transport Safety Board said it was aware of the NTSB report and would consider the U.S. statement in its probe. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The NTSB said the Japanese agency was participating in its investigation of the Boston incident, while NTSB officials were helping the agency with its investigation of the emergency landing in Japan. Both investigations were ongoing. ####  ##### ""There's nothing more I can add at this point, as we still haven't started our investigation into the battery here,"" JTSB inspector Hideyo Kosugi told Reuters. ""The NTSB's investigation started earlier. We still haven't taken X-rays or CT-scans of the battery."" ####  ##### Mr. Kosugi said both the battery and the surrounding systems were being stored in Tokyo's Haneda Airport until authorities decided where to conduct the Japanese investigation. ####  ##### Boeing said on Friday it would continue building the carbon-composite 787, but it put deliveries on hold until the FAA approves and implements a plan to ensure the safety of potentially flammable lithium-ion batteries. ####  ##### In Washington, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the 787, which has a list price of $207 million, would not fly until regulators were ""1,000% sure"" it was safe. ####  ##### Japan is the biggest market so far for the 787, with ANA and JAL operating 24 of the 290-seat wide-bodied planes. Boeing has orders for almost 850 of the planes, which have the most complex electrical systems of any planes on the market. ####  ##### It remains unclear if the investigations will cause other airlines — and military aircraft builder — to rethink their plans to use lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and more powerful than conventional batteries. ####  ##### Airbus plans to use similar batteries on its rival to the 787, the A350, which is due to make its maiden test flight in the middle of this year. ####  ##### European executives said last week they would study the findings of the U.S. investigation, but said their decision to move more slowly than Boeing towards electric systems, and spread the load over twice as many batteries, would reduce the risk. ####  ##### Aviation Week quoted Airbus programs chief Tom Williams as saying ""failure management"" was key and that any escaping gases from the A350 batteries would be protected by titanium as they are expelled from the aircraft. The company has not said if it would attempt to suppress a lithium fire or focus on containing a lithium blaze, as Boeing has done. ####  ##### Mr. Williams told Aviation Week that switching from lithium back to nickel cadmium would require significant engineering work with both space and weight penalties. Airbus was not immediately available to comment on the article. ####  ##### Brazilian planemaker Embraer S.A. declined comment when asked if it planned to rethink its use of lithium-ion batteries on its military transport plane and new business jets. ####  ##### The Embraer programs use a battery made in the United States, unlike the Japanese one on the 787. ####  ##### Lockheed Martin Corp., maker of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, has said it does not see a problem since the lithium-ion batteries on the military plane are made by France's Saft Groupe, not Yuasa. #### "

"BASF to pay $500,000 to settle retaliation lawsuit";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Chemical company BASF Corp. has agreed to pay $500,000 to settle an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission retaliation lawsuit in which an employee refused to sign away his right to sue for any future discrimination. ####  ##### In its lawsuit, the EEOC alleged that Cognis Corp., which has since been acquired by BASF, required Steven Whitlow, a long-term employee at its Kankakee, Ill., facility, to sign a “last-chance agreement” as a condition of continued employment. The agreement prohibited him from filing discrimination charges with the EEOC even for events that had not yet occurred. ####  ##### Cognis fired him when he informed the company he did not want to be bound by the agreement out of concern about how it would affect his civil rights, the EEOC said. ####  ##### The lawsuit, which accused the company of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, also accused Cognis of retaliation against five additional employees by forcing them to make a similarly illegal choice. These employees chose to sign the last-chance agreement rather than be terminated. By settling the lawsuit, BASF has opted not to continue defending those allegations, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### U.S. District Court Judge Michael P. McCuskey in an Urbana, Ill., hearing last May ruled that the company unlawfully retaliated against Mr. Whitlow. ####  ##### Judge McCuskey entered a consent decree resolving the lawsuit on Jan. 25, and the EEOC announced the settlement last week. In addition to providing monetary relief to the workers, the decree requires BASF to report all employee Title VII retaliation complaints to the EEOC for the next two years. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Cognis presented the victims in this case with a terrible, illegal choice: lose your job or lose your civil rights,” EEOC Chicago District Director John Rowe said in a statement. “Under the law, no worker has to make that kind of choice. Employers would be better served by working to ensure that their employees are free from discrimination, rather than threatening their workers with termination in an effort to make sure that employees don't complain."" ####  ##### In a statement, BASF said it is “satisfied to have reached a settlement with the EEOC and six other individuals participating in this lawsuit regarding events that occurred at the Kankakee site before BASF acquired it from Cognis Corp. ####  ##### “The settlement allows BASF to move forward without having to incur the time and expense of having to further litigate this matter. BASF is deeply committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and takes its responsibilities for compliance with all federal, state and local laws seriously.” ####  ##### Florham, N.J.-based BASF, a North American affiliate of Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF S.E.A., acquired Cognis in August 2010. #### "
"Appeals court upholds $415k verdict against Auto Zone in EEOC lawsuit";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes, Employment Practices, Workers Comp Coverage, Disability";" ##### A federal appeals court has upheld a $415,000 verdict against auto parts retailer AutoZone Inc. in a disability discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ####  ##### The case considered in Friday's ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. AutoZone Inc. has a long and complex history. According to the ruling, John Shepherd began working for Memphis, Tenn.-based AutoZone in 1998, but had suffered a chronic back injury while working for a different employer. Mr. Shepherd claimed that despite repeated requests for accommodation, his supervisors insisted he mop AutoZone's floors, which caused flare-ups of his injury. ####  ##### After he sought to return to work following one such injury flare-up in January 2004, AutoZone would not allow him to return and kept him on involuntary medical leave until February 2005, when it terminated his employment. The EEOC filed suit on Mr. Shepherd's behalf in 2007, charging the firm with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to accommodate his disability, and with retaliation when it refused to allow him to return to work and later terminated him. ####  ##### Court actions ####  ##### A magistrate judge granted summary judgment to AutoZone on the accommodation claim, but allowed the involuntary leave and termination claims to go to trial. A jury ruled in AutoZone's favor on those claims. The EEOC appealed the magistrate's grant of summary judgment on the accommodation claim, but not the jury's verdict. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### On appeal, in 2010 the 7th Circuit reversed the magistrate judge's grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. After a second trial, a jury awarded Mr. Shepherd $115,000 in back pay, $100,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages. The magistrate judge remitted the punitive damages to $200,000 to bring the compensatory and punitive damages within the ADA's $300,000 statutory cap. He also issued an injunction on AutoZone's antidiscrimination practices. ####  ##### AutoZone appealed the ruling. The appellate court affirmed the judge's monetary award. On compensatory damages, for instance, the unanimous three-judge panel said the judge “accurately observed that the compensatory damages in this case are approximately the same value as the compensatory damages awarded in comparable cases. … In fact, Shepherd's case is more extreme than some of these cases because Shepherd experienced near-daily pain that left him incapable of performing common activities, such as putting on his clothes and taking a shower.” ####  ##### The appellate court agreed to remand for further proceedings a provision in the injunction against AutoZone, stating it should be adjusted to reflect a time limit. #### "
"Security experts say zombie TV warning exposes flaws";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — The zombie attack alert issued on a handful of U.S. TV stations this week is more serious than a mischievous hacker prank say cyber experts, who warn the incident exposes lax security practices in a critical public safety system. ####  ##### While broadcasters said poor password security paved the way for the bogus warning, security experts said the equipment used by the Emergency Alert System remained vulnerable when stations allow it be accessed via the public Internet. ####  ##### The fear is that hackers could prevent the government from sending out public warnings during an emergency or attackers could conduct a more damaging hoax than a warning of a zombie apocalypse. ####  ##### ""It isn't what they said. It is the fact that they got into the system. They could have caused some real damage,"" said Karole White, president of the Michigan Association of Broadcasters. ####  ##### Following the attacks on Monday, broadcasters were ordered to change the passwords for the EAS equipment. ####  ##### The Federal Communications Commission would not comment on the attacks, but in an urgent advisory sent to television stations on Tuesday said: ""All EAS participants are required to take immediate action."" ####  ##### It instructed them to change passwords on equipment from all manufacturers used to deliver emergency broadcasts. The FCC instructed them to ensure gear was properly secured behind firewalls and to inspect systems to ensure that hackers had not queued ""unauthorized alerts"" for future transmission. ####  ##### The attacks come after warnings by government officials and outside security experts that the United States is at risk of a cyber attack that could cause major physical damage or even cost lives. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### President Barack Obama told Congress on Tuesday that some hackers were looking for ways to attack the U.S. power grid, banks and air traffic control systems. ####  ##### Ms. White and her counterpart in Montana, Greg MacDonald, said they believed the hackers were able to get in because TV stations had not changed the default passwords they used when the equipment was first shipped from the manufacturer. ####  ##### But Mike Davis, a hardware security expert with a firm known as IOActive Labs, said hackers could still get past new passwords to remotely access the systems. ####  ##### Mr. Davis said he had submitted a report to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or US-CERT, about a month ago that detailed the security flaws. ####  ##### ""Changing passwords is insufficient to prevent unauthorized remote login. There are still multiple undisclosed authentication bypasses,"" he told Reuters via email. ""I would recommend disconnecting them from the network until a fix is available."" ####  ##### Mr. Davis said he was able to use Google Inc.'s search engine to identify some 30 systems that he believed were vulnerable to attack as of Wednesday morning. ####  ##### Privately held Monroe Electronics, whose equipment was compromised in Monday's attacks, said it was still evaluating the risks. ####  ##### ""The situation appears to just be the password stuff, but we are looking at anything else and everything that might come into play,"" Vice President Bill Robertson told Reuters. ####  ##### A spokesman for US-CERT said he could not immediately comment on the matter. ####  ##### The zombie hackers targeted two stations in Michigan, and several in California, Montana and New Mexico, Ms. White said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A male voice addressed viewers in a video posted on the Internet of the bogus warning broadcast from KRTV, a CBS affiliate based in Great Falls, Mont.: ""Civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from the grave and attacking the living."" ####  ##### The voice warned not ""to approach or apprehend these bodies as they are extremely dangerous."" ####  ##### Stuart McClure, chief executive of cyber security firm Cylance Inc., said he had investigated cases in which hackers accessed EAS systems via a different method: breaking into hidden accounts built into the systems by manufacturers so that service technicians can easily access them for repairs. ####  ##### ""You cannot give a separate pass code to everybody. Nobody is going to remember it. You have to share the secret,"" said Mr. McClure, who previously ran a unit at Intel Corp.'s McAfee security division that investigated cyber attacks. ####  ##### Electronics industry experts said that it is tough for some broadcasters to follow all security guidelines because staff at small stations lack the expertise to do so. ####  ##### The equipment that was compromised obtains emergency broadcasts by frequently using the Internet to make outward calls to trusted government servers. When it finds an alert on one of those servers, it broadcasts it on that station. ####  ##### Monroe Electronics said its gear is designed to let stations make outgoing queries, but still keep outsiders from getting in. ####  ##### It recommends against unsecured access to the Internet. ""It's the wild, wild West,"" said Mr. Robertson. ####  ##### He said the equipment sometimes gets exposed to the open Internet because it is not properly configured or because engineers want remote access when they are on call. ####  ##### Mr. Robertson said the company was working to beef up security on the equipment and might update its software to compel customers to change default passwords. ####  ##### Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dan Watson said that the zombie breach did not have any impact on the government's ability to activate the Emergency Alert System. #### "

In 2008, she was terminated for not having current certifications and violations committed during a call to the scene of a 2007 fatal accident. ####  ##### In 2008, Ms. Smith filed a charge of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging gender discrimination and retaliation. The EEOC dismissed her complaint, then she filed a civil action against the city, according to court documents. ####  ##### In the suit, filed in 2011, Ms. Smith alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on her gender, was repeatedly harassed, denied training, unjustly suspended, and was told by a supervisor to “get pregnant so I could have you as my new secretary instead of having you fight fires.” ####  ##### After making numerous complaints about lieutenants and chiefs in the New Smyrna Beach fire department, Ms. Smith claims she was fired on trumped-up charges, according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division. ####  ##### The jury’s unanimous verdict came at the end of a six-day trial. Along with the monetary award, Ms. Smith is entitled under state and federal law to reinstatement or front-pay, which will be decided by District Judge Roy B.

This is the latest in a series of commission trial victories nationwide.” ####  ##### Rita Kittle, supervisory trial attorney for the EEOC’s Denver field office who tried the case for the EEOC, said in a statement, “It is particularly important for the EEOC to vigorously enforce the anti-retaliation provisions in the employment discrimination laws. If employees do not feel comfortable coming forward when they feel they are being discriminated against, the very purpose of the anti-discrimination statutes is eviscerated.” ####  ##### A RadioShack spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. #### "
"Police officer whistle-blower's wrongful termination case can proceed";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### A police officer, who was fired after complaining to the FBI about being forced to release a politically connected driver he had arrested, can pursue his wrongful termination claim, an appeals court ruled. ####  ##### According to last week's ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in David Kristofek v. Village of Orland Hills and Thomas Scully, in November 2010, Mr. Kristofek, a part-time officer for the Illinois village's police department, arrested a driver who was the son of a former mayor of a nearby town for having a suspended registration and no proof of insurance. The department's deputy police chief ordered Mr. Kristofek to release the driver without charging him. ####  ##### Subsequently, Mr. Kristofek expressed concern to fellow officers “that he and other officers were potentially involved with political corruption and that they may have committed a crime,” according to the ruling. He also consulted with an attorney on the issue, and pursuant to the attorney's advice, went to the FBI, and was told there would be an investigation. ####  ##### In April 2011, the department's police chief, Thomas Scully, gave Mr. Kristofek the option of resigning or having his employment terminated. When Mr. Kristofek said he would not resign, Mr. Scully fired him. ####  ##### Mr. Kristofek subsequently filed suit, claiming violations of his First Amendment rights and the Illinois Whistleblower Act, among other state laws. A lower court in Chicago dismissed the case, holding that Mr. Kristofek's “sole motive in spreading the word about political corruption was to protect himself from civil and criminal liability.” ####  ##### In overruling the lower court and reinstating the case, a three-judge panel held “a public employee's speech may still be protected if the speaker's motives were mixed, and also included a desire to help the public.” ####  ##### The panel said “at no point does the complaint allege that Mr. Kristofek's' only motive was to protect himself. The mere fact that Kristofek was motivated by his self-interest does not make it implausible that he was also motivated to help the public,” said the court. ####  ##### Furthermore, said the court, “even if Kristofek was motivated exclusively by his own self-interest, his First Amendment claim would not necessarily be dismissed.” A whistle-blower's “exclusive motive may be a desire for fame and a book deal, but it is also accurate to say that the main objective of his speech, given its content, context, and the manner it which it is delivered — is to reform the system,” the appellate court ruled in remanding the case. #### "
"FAA approves Boeing 787 certification plan";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday approved Boeing Co.'s plan to certify a redesigned battery system on the 787 Dreamliner and will permit two aircraft limited flights to test it. ####  ##### The FAA's move puts Boeing one step closer to returning the troubled 787 to the air after the plane was grounded in mid-January by transport authorities worldwide following two incidents involving burning batteries. ####  ##### ""We won't allow the plane to return to service unless we're satisfied that the new design ensures the safety of the aircraft and its passengers,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. ####  ##### Boeing's new battery — which it presented to the FAA in late February — is designed to minimize the chances of a short circuit, insulates the cells within the battery better and adds a new containment and venting system to prevent damage even if the battery catches fire. ####  ##### The FAA said the new design must pass a series of tests before it is approved and that the agency will be ""closely involved"" in the certification process. ####  ##### ""Today's approval from the FAA is a critical and welcome milestone toward getting the fleet flying again and continuing to deliver on the promise of the 787,"" Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said in a statement. ####  ##### Regulators grounded the 50 Dreamliners in use by airlines on Jan. 16 after lithium-ion batteries burned aboard two planes, banning airlines from flying the 787 and stopping Boeing from delivering them. Although its factories continue to make the 787, Boeing is losing an estimated $50 million a week while the planes are grounded. #### "
"Toys R Us charged with discriminating against deaf job applicant";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### Toys R Us Inc. faces an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit charging the retailer with violating federal law when it allegedly refused to provide an interpreter for a deaf job applicant and then failed to hire her. ####  ##### The EEOC said Tuesday that Shakirra Thomas applied for a team member position at the Wayne, N.J.-based retailer's Columbia, Md., store in October, 2011. ####  ##### According to the EEOC, when Toys R Us contacted Ms. Thomas to invite her to a group interview, her mother advised the company that Ms. Thomas was deaf and requested an interpreter for the interview. The company refused and said Ms. Thomas would have to provide her own interpreter. ####  ##### After Ms. Thomas' mother interpreted for her during the group interview, the company refused to hire Ms. Thomas despite her qualifications and ability to perform the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, the EEOC said. The agency is charging the company with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. ####  ##### “Federal law requires employers to provide a reasonable accommodation during the interview process, including providing an American Sign Language interpreter, unless the employer can show it would be a significant difficulty or expense to do so,” said EEOC district director Spencer H. Lewis Jr., of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office, in a statement. ####  ##### “It is difficult to understand how it would have been an undue hardship for such a large retailer to provide an interpreter when asked to so,” he said. ####  ##### The company said in a statement, “As this is a matter of pending litigation, we cannot comment at this time.” ####  ##### In September 2012, Oshkosh, Wis.-based catalog retailer Miles Kimball Co. reached a $95,000 settlement with the EEOC in a case in which a deaf worker was allegedly fired after the company denied her request for a sign language interpreter to help train her on a new software program for the company's computer system. #### "
"Transocean should have done more before 2010 Gulf spill: CEO";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Catastrophes, Energy";" ##### (Reuters) — The chief executive of Transocean Ltd., owner of the rig destroyed after BP P.L.C.'s Macondo well blew out in 2010, testified on Tuesday that his workers made mistakes that day, but were not responsible for overall safety at the site. ####  ##### Steven Newman, who had been CEO for less than two months when the blowout occurred, was emotional at times as he spoke of the company's responsibilities prior to the accident that killed 11 people and caused the worst U.S. offshore oil spill. ####  ##### ""We acknowledge that we should have done more,"" he said under questioning by a lawyer for Transocean, in the fourth week of a civil trial to determine blame for the spill. ####  ##### Mr. Newman's voice shook as he spoke of the April 20, 2010, disaster on the Deepwater Horizon rig, but he denied that Transocean cut corners when it came to safety procedures. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Gulf states affected and other plaintiffs are suing BP, Transocean and other companies for economic and environmental damages related to the spill. BP accepts its role in the accident, but believes Transocean and well-cementing provider Halliburton Co. share the blame. ####  ##### Mr. Newman said Transocean was in charge of safely performing its own operations on the rig, but that overall responsibility for safety at the well site rested solely with BP. ####  ##### In the same New Orleans federal court two weeks ago before U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier, a Transocean worker who was on the Deepwater Horizon during the blowout acknowledged there was a misinterpretation of trouble signs beforehand. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Newman discussed how Transocean responds to potentially dangerous situations such as a ""kick,"" which results when unexpected pressure forces fluids upward through the well. Company policy states a well should be shut in if a kick pushes as much as 20 barrels of hydrocarbons through the drill hole. ####  ##### The kick size may be a key point in finger-pointing between Transocean and BP. In testimony on Monday, well control expert Calvin Barnwell, who reviewed the incident for Transocean, said about 39 barrels of fluid pushed up through the Macondo well in the early afternoon on the day of the explosion. ####  ##### Asked by a BP lawyer if he agreed BP was ""entitled to rely on Transocean"" to shut in the well after the 39-barrel kick, Mr. Barnwell answered yes. ####  ##### Transocean has pleaded guilty to federal charges connected with Clean Water Act violations and agreed to pay $1.4 billion in criminal and civil fines and penalties. ####  ##### As for the civil case before Judge Barbier, the companies must show any mistakes do not meet the legal definition of gross negligence required for the highest amount of damages. BP has already spent or committed $37 billion on cleanup, restoration, payouts, settlements and fines. ####  ##### Judge Barbier scheduled a hearing for April 5 to consider BP's objections to some of the ""fictitious"" and ""absurd"" oil spill compensation claims addressed through a claims facility set up last year. ####  ##### On top of that, liabilities could stretch into the tens of billions of dollars if Judge Barbier determines BP or other defendants were grossly negligent. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Establishing management responsibility could be important in proving gross negligence. Robert Cunningham, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, finished grilling of Mr. Newman by asking: ""So you have identified no management failures that caused or contributed to the blowout?"" ####  ##### ""No,"" Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Mr. Newman has been well compensated for Transocean's very public struggles over the past three years. According to a company filing on Monday, his total 2012 pay package of $14 million is more than double the level of 2010, lifted by stock and option awards and nonequity incentives. ####  ##### Transocean shares, which traded in the $80 range prior to Macondo, hit a seven-year low of $38.22 in late 2011, and have staged a relatively dramatic recovery from that trough since then. The stock closed at $52.22 on Tuesday. ####  ##### Mr. Newman was on the stand in New Orleans a day after presenting at the Howard Weil energy conference across town, where much of the talk was about the dramatic post-Macondo revival of drilling in the deepest waters of the Gulf of Mexico — described as the world's fastest-growing deepwater market. ####  ##### ""If a typical deepwater well is like going to the moon, then the Gulf of Mexico ultra-deepwater frontier is like going to Mars,"" Martin Craighead, CEO of oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc., said in a speech at the conference. ####  ##### The court case is In re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig ""Deepwater Horizon"" in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, No. 10-md-02179, in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana. #### "

"P/C insurers' enterprise risk management practices maturing: Study";"Risk Management";"Enterprise Risk Management, P/C Insurers, Regulation, Tech Insights";" ##### A Standard & Poor’s Financial Services L.L.C. has found that enterprise risk management practices are continuing to mature at property/casualty insurers. ####  ##### The report released Thursday surveyed ERM initiatives at 146 property/casualty and life and health insurers. It assigned scores of “excellent,” “strong,” “adequate” or “weak.” ####  ##### Only three firms — Pembroke, Bermuda-based RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., New York-based The Travelers Cos. Inc. and San Antonio-based USAA Insurance Group — earned an “excellent” score. ####  ##### However, the study rated 21% of property/casualty insurers as “strong” while only 9% of life/health insurers earned that score. ####  ##### “More P&C companies (as a percentage) have scores higher than ‘adequate’ than for life and health companies,” S&P said in the report. “We believe this results primarily from the higher level of exposure life companies have to asset and market/interest-related risks and the difficulties inherent in managing those risks.” ####  ##### S&P also credited regulatory pressure for insurers attaching more rigor to their ERM efforts. ####  ##### “The approaching 2015 effective date of the National Association of Insurance Commissioner's (own risk and solvency assessment) requirements has resulted in increased momentum for improvement in insurers’ risk management processes,” the report states. ####  ##### “Companies with more robust ERM programs gauge their risk profiles better and are able to communicate them clearly to their investors and other stakeholders,” the report states. “Such companies are also able to manage their risks within their stated tolerance levels. We thus expect stronger ERM programs to result in more stable, predictable earnings, whereas companies with less robust programs likely will be more susceptible to earnings swings.” #### "
"Biotechnology firm Amgen settles kickback allegations for $24.9M";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Biotechnology company Amgen Inc. has agreed to pay $24.9 million to resolve charges under the False Claims Act that it was involved in a kickback scheme with long-term care pharmacy providers, the U.S. Department of Justice said. ####  ##### The settlement with Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based Amgen, announced Tuesday, settles charges it paid kickbacks to Cincinnati-based Omnicare Inc., and PharMerica Corp. and Kindred Healthcare Inc., both based in Louisville, Ky., in return for implementing “therapeutic interchange” programs designed to switch Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries from a competitor drug to its own product, the Justice Department said. ####  ##### The government charged the kickbacks took the form of “performance-based rebates” that were tied to market share or volume thresholds. The DOJ said that as part of the therapeutic interchange programs, Amgen distributed material to consulting pharmacists and nursing home staff encouraging the off-label use of Aranesp, a drug used to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure, for patients who did not have the condition. ####  ##### The DOJ said the civil settlement resolves a lawsuit filed under a whistle-blower provision of the False Claims Act that was filed in U.S. District Court in Columbia, S.C. ####  ##### The DOJ said only allegations were settled by the agreement, and that there has been no determination of liability in the case. ####  ##### “We will continue to pursue pharmaceutical companies that pay kickbacks to long-term care pharmacy providers to influence drug prescribing decisions,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division, in a statement. “Patients in skilled nursing facilities deserve care that is free of improper financial influences.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “By this agreement we are making important strides in holding drug manufacturers accountable for fraudulent and abusive practices not only in South Carolina but nationwide,” said William Nettles, U.S. attorney for the District of South Carolina. ####  ##### “The conduct alleged in this case is yet another example of the pharmaceutical industry placing marketing goals over patient needs,” said Reuben A. Guttman, a Washington-based director with law firm Grant & Eisenhofer P.A., who represented whistle-blower Frank Kurnick, an Amgen employee, in the litigation, in a statement. ####  ##### “For situations like this, there has to be a pharmaceutical safety and investigation board to make an even broader report to the public so that this never happens again,” Mr. Guttman said. ####  ##### Amgen said in a statement that it has “denied all of these allegations that were resolved by the settlement.” ####  ##### It said the South Carolina settlement is the fourth of five previously disclosed whistle-blower actions filed against it “that were made known to the company in connection with discussions that resulted in an October 2011 agreement in principle to settle different allegations related to Amgen's sales and marketing practices.” ####  ##### The company said the first of these five whistle-blower suits was settled in December 2012, along with matters covered by the October 2011 agreement in principle. Amgen has been dismissed as a defendant from two of the other whistle-blower suits, according to Amgen. Information about the fifth case is under court seal, an Amgen spokeswoman said. ####  ##### In a statement issued the Dec. 12, 2012, settlement, the company said it would pay $612 million to resolve its civil liability related to certain promotional practices related to Aranesp as well as several other drugs. It said as part of the settlement agreement with the federal government, 49 states and the District of Columbia, Amgen pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor count of misbranding Aranesp “by promoting it in a way that was different from the dosages in the label.” The plea was entered in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. #### "
"Rio Tinto unit says Bingham Canyon slide worse than expected";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Catastrophes";" ##### (Reuters) — A landslide at Rio Tinto's Bingham Canyon mine in Utah extended further into the pit than predicted, and there was greater damage to equipment than previously estimated, Rio's Kennecott unit said on Friday. ####  ##### Kennecott Utah Copper, which operates the mine that is near Salt Lake City, said it had not yet determined the impact of the slide, which occurred late on Wednesday, or a time frame for resuming mining operations. ####  ##### Photos published by Salt Lake City's Deseret News show debris extending from the top of the massive pit mine to its floor, slicing through terraced roads and burying trucks. ####  ##### ""The size of the slide was significant,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""We don't have information yet regarding the magnitude or impact. We do know that the flow into the pit extended beyond the scenarios we forecasted, having a greater impact on equipment."" ####  ##### The company said on Thursday that all employees were accounted for and safe. ####  ##### In its latest statement, Kennecott said there had been some damage to equipment and to a building structure in the mine. It said experts had not been granted access to the mine. ####  ##### Landslides can seriously disrupt operations at open pit operations. Lundin Mining Corp. resumed production at its Aguablanca nickel-copper mine in Spain nearly two years after heavy rains caused a slide there. ####  ##### A note on Kennecott's website says the mine's visitor center will not reopen in 2013. ####  ##### Justin Jones, a spokesman for Kennecott, said earlier on Friday that Bingham Canyon was still producing copper from stockpiled material. Mr. Jones could not say then how long the smelting and refining process could continue, and that was still being assessed. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""The mine itself is very large, and there are possibilities that we can begin starting portions of the mine, you know, within a few days, thus not interrupting the production of copper,"" he said. ####  ##### Kennecott is the second-largest copper producer in the United States, and Bingham Canyon, one of the world's largest open pits, produced 163,200 tonnes of copper last year, as well as 200,000 ounces of gold. ####  ##### In a note to clients, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tony Robson said that on a provisional basis, he expects between 80,000 and 160,000 tonnes of copper could be lost this year, and production could be affected in 2014 and 2015 as well. ####  ##### Rio said last June that it would invest $660 million over the next seven years to extend the life of the mine to 2029, from 2018. #### "

"UnitedHealth faces $524 million jury award in hepatitis case";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A Las Vegas jury on Tuesday awarded $524 million, including $500 million in punitive damages, against UnitedHealth Group Inc. units in connection with a hepatitis outbreak tied to a doctor who was credentialed by the insurer. ####  ##### Plaintiff attorney Robert Eglet, of law firm Eglet Wall Christiansen in Las Vegas, said between 2004 and 2008, there were 200 cases of hepatitis C tied to two endoscopy clinics run by gastroenterologist Dr. Dipak Desai, who had been credentialed by UnitedHealth. ####  ##### The jury verdicts were issued to Helen Meyer and Bonnie Brunson, who had contracted hepatitis, and Ms. Brunson's husband, Carl Brunson, who had sued for loss of consortium. Defendants in the case were UnitedHealth units Health Plan of Nevada Inc. and Sierra Health Services Inc. ####  ##### Dr. Desai was accused of using unsanitary practices in colonoscopies. Mr. Eglet said Dr. Desai had performed endoscopies that should have taken 30 minutes, in less than five. He said he represents 23 other plaintiffs in connection with the case, with the next trial scheduled for December. ####  ##### Mr. Eglet said Dr. Desai had been dropped as a preferred provider from UnitedHealth's health maintenance organization in 1992, but the HMO took him on again several years later because he performed endoscopies at a low cost. He said Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth had ignored warnings from other physicians in the community that Dr. Desai was dangerous and never informed its credentialing committee of the warnings. ####  ##### Commenting on the jury verdict, Health Plan of Nevada said in a statement: “The number announced today has no grounding whatsoever in reality — it represents fantasy damages, not punitive damages. We have a compelling case for appeal since the jurors were barred from hearing extensive evidence and testimony about how Dr. Desai's covert, criminal practices were hidden from the entire community, including Health Plan of Nevada.” ####  ##### %%break%% ####  ##### The insurer said that the jury did not hear that Dr. Desai has been criminally charged for the outbreak and that the same plaintiffs had already sued and received damages awards from a pharmaceutical company. In addition, it said that Dr. Desai was credentialed or accredited by other HMOs, hospitals and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. ####  ##### “Even more troubling, the court held that placing Dr. Desai in (HealthCare of Nevada's) network caused the plaintiffs to contract hepatitis C because: (1) plaintiffs' hepatitis C was the result of Desai's medical malpractice; and (2) a doctor's medical malpractice is always a foreseeable consequence of placing a doctor in a health plan's network. If allowed to stand, this would have a devastating impact on the availability and affordability of health insurance in Nevada,” the statement said. ####  ##### In 2010, Jerusalem-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. announced a Las Vegas jury awarded $356 million in punitive damages against its Teva Parenteral Medicines Inc. unit in connection with its propofol anesthetic, which reportedly was used in the colonoscopies. According to media reports, the company subsequently agreed to pay $250 million to settle more than 80 lawsuits over propofol sales. News reports say the issue was that Teva sold the anesthetic in oversized vials that invited reuse, which led to the hepatitis being spread. A Teva spokesman could not be reached. ####  ##### Helen Mayer as individual v. Health Plan of Nevada et al.  and Bonnie J. and Carl Brunson, individually and as husband and wife vs. Health Plan of Nevada et al. were filed in January, 2010. #### "
"Colorado House passes stop-loss insurance legislation";"Risk Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits";" ##### The Colorado House of Representatives has approved legislation that would restrict stop-loss insurance sold to small employers. ####  ##### The bill, H.B. 13-1290, would amend Colorado's existing laws by establishing minimum specific attachment points of $20,000 for medical stop-loss coverage sold to self-insured employers with 50 or fewer full-time workers. It also would set minimum aggregate attachment points of 120% of expected claims or $20,000, whichever is lower. ####  ##### The bill would prohibit insurers from setting attachment points that vary by individual plan participants within an insured group for claims incurred per individual. ####  ##### A previous version of the bill would have set the minimum specific attachment points at $30,000. The amended version was approved April 16 by the Colorado House Health, Insurance and Environment Committee, and on Monday passed the full Colorado House by a 45-15 vote. ####  ##### Under the plan, insurers in Colorado would be required to file annual reports with the state's insurance commissioner that detail their portfolio of stop-loss clients with 100 or fewer employees. The reports would need to include the total number of covered lives, the mean and median attachment points, and sources of prior coverage held by the stop-loss clients. ####  ##### The proposal also would give the state's insurance commissioner license to unilaterally change minimum attachment points going forward, based on medical cost inflation. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for state Rep. Elizabeth McCann, D-Denver, the bill's primary sponsor, said the bill must be introduced in the Colorado Senate prior to the legislature's May 8 recess to remain alive this session. #### "

The $5 billion a year direct-payment subsidy — a target of reformers — would end. Separate insurance programs to guarantee revenue to cotton and peanut growers would be created, as well as an insurance program to compensate growers if revenue from other crops drops by more than 10%. #### "

"Czech floods seen costing insurers $381 million";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, P/C Insurers, Central & Eastern Europe";" ##### (Reuters) — Insured damage from the worst floods in the Czech Republic in more than a decade could cost 7.5 billion crowns ($381.4 million), the country’s insurers said on Thursday. ####  ##### The Czech Insurance Association said its members, who cover 98% of the market, had already registered 10,000 claims, but that number could rise to 96,000, according to early estimates. ####  ##### Around 19,000 people have been evacuated in the Czech Republic and tens of thousands more in neighboring central European countries in the region’s worst flooding since 2002. A dozen people have been reported killed in the region. ####  ##### Water levels were falling on all Czech rivers on Thursday, the fifth day of flooding, but the surge of water along the Elbe river was still making its way north into Germany. ####  ##### To the south, parts of Austria were flooded while the Danube was expected to crest in Slovakia on Thursday. ####  ##### The Czech government has freed up 5.3 billion crowns ($269.3 million) for flood repairs. Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said on Czech Television on Thursday that he was also preparing plans to give some affected businesses tax breaks. ####  ##### Spolana, a chemical factory in Neratovice, north of Prague, was inundated, and another chemical plant north of Prague, Lovochemie, was also affected. ####  ##### The Agrarian Chamber said that 80,000 hectares out of 4.3 million hectares of farmland — mostly grain fields but also some sugar beet and hop-growing areas — were under water. ####  ##### The country’s dominant electricity producer CEZ was forced to shut down two power plant units on Tuesday as a preventative measure, cutting off supplies to thousands of homes. ####  ##### The flooding this year was not as serious as record floods that hit Prague’s historic centre in 2002. In that year, damage around central Europe was estimated at €20 billion ($26.17 billion). The 2002 floods cost Czech insurers 35 billion crowns( $1.78 billion). #### "
"Scor buys Generali's U.S. life reinsurance business for $920 million";"Risk Management";"SCOR, France, Italy, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### (Reuters) — Italy's biggest insurer Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. said on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its U.S. life reinsurance business to France's Scor S.E. for total proceeds of $920 million as part of its strategy to shed non-core assets. ####  ##### The deal, under which Scor is paying €579 million ($750 million) in cash plus an additional amount for whatever the unit earns this year before the deal's expected completion in the second half, will make Scor the largest U.S. life reinsurer. ####  ##### Generali said in its statement it estimates the unit's earnings to be $30 million this year up to the time of the closing, lifting the price paid the unit to just above $780 million. ####  ##### Earlier this year Generali's new chief executive Mario Greco pledged to raise e4 billion from non-core asset sales by 2015 to shore up capital and restore value. ####  ##### Europe's third-largest insurer is also seeking to dispose of its private bank BSI but potential buyers think it is worth less that its 2.3 billion Swiss franc ($2.4 billion) book value. ####  ##### Gross proceeds from the U.S. sale, including the release of $140 million of collateral now locked in the business, are expected to total $920 million, Generali said in a statement, adding that the deal was expected to generate a capital gain of about $150 million. ####  ##### Generali, which has been undergoing a radical transformation since Mr. Greco took office just under a year ago, said the deal would lift its Solvency 1 ratio, a measure of capital strength, by 1 percentage point. ####  ##### Scor became the second-largest U.S. life reinsurer after it acquired Transamerica Re from Aegon for $912.5 million in 2011. ####  ##### Acquiring Generali USA is consistent with Scor's strategy of growing in the Americas and taking advantage of the non-cyclical nature of the life insurance market. Scor has doubled the number of its employees in the region since 2005 to support the high double-digit annual growth of the group there. ####  ##### Scor, which was bidding against Reinsurance Group of America in the last round of the auction, said it would finance the deal from its own funds and potential limited debt sale, without issuing new shares. ####  ##### Generali was advised by Citigroup and Mediobanca on the deal, while Scor was advised by BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank. #### "
"Bank of America rejects AIG bid to reopen $8.5B mortgage accord";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### NEW YORK (Reuters) — Bank of America Corp has rejected a bid to reopen negotiations into its proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities, indicating it plans to take its chances that a New York judge will approve the deal. ####  ##### American International Group Inc. and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and Indianapolis, which object to the settlement, sent a letter to Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the trustee overseeing the securities. ####  ##### The letter, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court on Thursday, requested immediate settlement discussions. ####  ##### “We are willing and available now to discuss ... how to best construct an open, fair and transparent process,” Daniel Reilly, a lawyer for AIG, and Derek Loeser, a lawyer for the home loan banks, wrote. ####  ##### AIG and other objectors complained that the accord offered them only a fraction of what they lost, and was negotiated without them. ####  ##### Justice Barbara Kapnick, who is hearing testimony to decide whether to approve the settlement, had asked the parties to consider mediation rather than wait for her to rule. ####  ##### Justice Kapnick made the request on June 14 before a break in the proceeding, which resumes July 8, the letter said. ####  ##### Bank of America had agreed to the settlement two years ago to resolve the claims of investors in bonds issued by mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp, which it bought in 2008. ####  ##### It hopes a settlement, if approved, will resolve much of its remaining legal obligations stemming from Countrywide. ####  ##### The Charlotte, N.C. -based bank paid $2.5 billion for Countrywide, but the purchase became an albatross and has cost the bank tens of billions of dollars for litigation, loan buybacks and other mortgage-related costs. ####  ##### Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc., MetLife Inc. and Allianz S.E.'s Pacific Investment Management Co., entered into the settlement. #### "

"Suit alleges Avon paid to keep official quiet in bribery probe";"Risk Management";"China";" ##### WASHINGTON (Reuters)—An amended lawsuit filed by shareholders of Avon Products Inc. alleges a former head of internal audit threatened to provide securities regulators with evidence of bribery at the cosmetics seller, but then extracted a larger severance package in 2006 in exchange for his silence. ####  ##### The former global internal audit director, Fabian LaPresa, threatened to turn over to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a draft internal report prepared by an Avon auditor that allegedly showed executives paid bribes to Chinese government officials as the company sought permission to sell products door-to-door, the lawsuit said. ####  ##### An Avon spokeswoman declined to comment on pending litigation. Mr. LaPresa could not be reached for comment. ####  ##### The lawsuit said the extra benefits allegedly provided to Mr. LaPresa for his silence could only have been approved by the company's former finance chief, Charles Cramb, suggesting Mr. Cramb also knew of the internal report as early as 2006. ####  ##### Mr. Cramb did not respond to a request for comment submitted through Avon. ####  ##### Avon had planned to terminate Mr. LaPresa for misusing his expense account and provide him the standard severance of three months of salary and benefits, the lawsuit said. ####  ##### But after Mr. LaPresa told his supervisor he would disclose information from the draft audit report if Avon didn't provide him with extra benefits, he was able to negotiate his severance to one year of salary and health insurance, the suit said. ####  ##### The alleged circumstances surrounding Mr. LaPresa's departure were disclosed in the amended lawsuit filed Friday by two German investment funds, LBBW Asset Management Investmentgesellschaft mbH and SGSS Deutschland Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH, on behalf of other Avon shareholders. ####  ##### The shareholders are seeking compensation for losses suffered from Avon's share price decline from highs above $40 a share in 2008. The stock is currently trading at $18.70. ####  ##### Gregg Levin, a partner with Motley Rice L.L.C., which represents the shareholders, declined to provide more details about the alleged threat from Mr. LaPresa and the terms of his departure from Avon. ####  ##### Even before Mr. LaPresa's alleged role came to light, the 2005 internal report had caught the attention of federal prosecutors, Reuters reported last month. ####  ##### Prosecutors are investigating whether there was an effort at Avon headquarters to take any action based on the report, which flagged concerns about the cosmetics seller's compliance with U.S. anti-bribery laws, or if company executives ignored or tried to bury it, two people familiar with the matter said. ####  ##### Avon in 2006 won the first-ever license given by China to a Western company to sell products door-to-door. At the time it was seen as a major coup by Chief Executive Andrea Jung. ####  ##### But in 2008, the company disclosed it had opened an internal inquiry into whether its China business had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. firms and others from paying bribes to officials of foreign governments. ####  ##### The Securities and Exchange Commission is also probing Avon's China activities for potential violations of the FCPA, which requires companies to keep accurate books and records. ####  ##### Ms. Jung has agreed to step down once Avon finds a new CEO, but she will stay on as executive chairman. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Motley Rice, the South Carolina law firm that filed the amended complaint, made its name suing asbestos and tobacco companies and is one of the largest plaintiff litigators in the United States. ####  ##### In the amended lawsuit, which updates an original lawsuit filed last year, the plaintiffs say their investigator interviewed Chinese government officials who ""confirmed"" details of the payments. ####  ##### The lawsuit said the four officials were all from different Chinese agencies. It said two of the officials were beneficiaries of ""unlawful payments."" ####  ##### The officials, according to the lawsuit, alleged that Avon executives paid third parties ""substantial sums"" to schedule meetings between Ms. Jung and high-level Chinese government ministers; they ""repeatedly"" treated Chinese licensing officials to dinner and karaoke; and they paid Chinese government officials to attend Avon press conferences. ####  ##### The officials interviewed also said the payments were made specifically in support of Avon's application for a direct sales license. ####  ##### The investigator did not provide the names or titles of the officials to the lawyers for fear of prosecution, but the investigator agreed to sign a sworn affidavit attesting to their identity. ####  ##### A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. LaPresa worked at Avon between 2004 and 2006, and previously worked in audit departments at PepsiCo Inc., Altria Corporate Services Inc., and Diesel S.p.A. After Avon he worked as chief audit officer at Chiquita Brands International. ####  ##### A Chiquita representative said Mr. LaPresa left the company several years ago. It is unclear where he now works and resides. #### "

"BizJet to pay $11.8M fine for bribing Latin American officials";"Risk Management";"Latin America, Political Risk";" ##### WASHINGTON—An Oklahoma-based aircraft maintenance company has agreed to pay nearly $12 million in fines for bribing Latin American government officials to secure maintenance contracts, according to a statement released last week by the U.S. Department of Justice. ####  ##### BizJet International Sales & Support Inc., based in Tulsa, Okla., will pay $11.8 million in criminal penalties for violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The department noted that BizJet's fine could have been more than double the agreed-upon amount had the company not voluntarily reported the bribes and stepped up its compliance efforts after the discovery. ####  ##### For in-depth coverage of this topic and related issues, visit the Business Insurance Solution Arc on  A World of Risk: Managing Foreign Bribery and Corruption Exposures. ####  ##### According to court documents, BizJet executives paid approximately $386,000 in cash and gifts between 2004 and 2010 to high-ranking officials of the Mexican Federal Police, the Mexican Presidential Fleet and the Panama Aviation Authority in exchange for maintenance contracts with those agencies. ####  ##### The payments were made either directly to officials working for the agencies or funneling payments through a nonexistent company run by a BizJet sales manager, the Justice Department said in the statement released last week. ####  ##### Under the terms of a three-year deferred settlement agreement filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on Wednesday, BizJet admitted responsibility for the violations, and agreed to cooperate with any ongoing or future DOJ investigations and periodically report to the department regarding its compliance efforts. The charge against BizJet could be dismissed at the end of the three-year term if the department is satisfied with the company's performance, court documents said. ####  ##### The DOJ also agreed to forgo prosecution of BizJet's indirect parent company, Hamburg, Germany-based Lufthansa Technik A.G., in exchange for the company's promise to cooperate with future investigations and implement strict internal controls. ####  ##### In court documents, the DOJ commended BizJet and Lufthansa for their “extraordinary cooperation,” including their internal investigations and voluntary disclosure of the FCPA violations. The department said the company’s cooperation was a primary consideration in reducing BizJet’s fine for the violations, which carry a potential penalty of more than $34 million. ####  ##### The department also highlighted the companies’ efforts to enhance its FCPA compliance after it discovered the bribes, including BizJet’s firing of the executives responsible for the malfeasance, enhanced due diligence for third-party business partners, and closer review of proposals and other transactional documents. ####  ##### “BizJet and the department agree that ($11.8 million) is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including BizJet’s voluntary disclosure, extraordinary cooperation and extensive remediation in this matter,” the agreement said. #### "

"BP proposes Gulf spill accord terms, trial delay";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, P/C Insurers";" ##### NEW ORLEANS (Reuters)—BP P.L.C. reached settlements to resolve billions of dollars of claims from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and asked a U.S. judge for a long delay in any trial over remaining disputes stemming from the disaster. ####  ##### The London-based oil company still expects under Wednesday's settlements to pay $7.8 billion to resolve economic, property and medical claims by more than 100,000 individuals and businesses, though there is no cap. ####  ##### That payout would make the accord one of the largest class-action settlements in U.S. history. ####  ##### ""Neither side will receive everything it wants,"" but the settlements are ""more than fair, reasonable and adequate"" and could avert a decade of litigation, BP and plaintiffs' lawyers said in papers filed in New Orleans federal court. ####  ##### Friday is the two-year anniversary of the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which killed 11 workers and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill after BP's Macondo well ruptured. An estimated 4.1 million barrels of oil were spilled and not cleaned up. ####  ##### ""BP made a commitment to help economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf Coast,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. ""This settlement provides the framework for us to continue delivering on that promise, offering those affected full and fair compensation, without waiting for the outcome of a lengthy trial process."" ####  ##### In a separate statement, Stephen Herman and James Roy, lawyers on the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee, said the settlement holds BP ""fully accountable."" ####  ##### Lawyers for the plaintiffs are seeking up to $600 million to cover fees and costs, including a $75 million interim award. These are separate from amounts paid to victims. ####  ##### BP still faces tens of billions of dollars of potential claims from the U.S. government; Gulf states; and drilling partners Transocean Ltd., which owned the rig, and Halliburton Co., which provided cementing services. ####  ##### The oil company's potential liability for violating the federal Clean Water Act alone could reach as high as $17.6 billion upon a finding of gross negligence. BP has already taken a $37.2 billion charge for the spill. ####  ##### About 109,000 condominium owners, hotel and resort operators, restaurateurs, shrimpers and others may be eligible to recover on economic and property claims, court papers show. ####  ##### The medical settlement addresses claims by people made ill from exposure to oil or chemical dispersants. It covers clean-up workers and residents of beachfront or wetlands areas, an d lets people who develop symptoms later to sue BP at that time. About 16,000 plaintiffs have submitted claims, court papers show. ####  ##### Those ineligible to recover include financial institutions, casinos, people claiming hardship from an Obama administration moratorium on deepwater drilling, and some private plaintiffs in Florida and Texas. ####  ##### Wednesday's settlements follow depositions of 311 witnesses, and the production of about 90 million pages of documents and about 20 terabytes of data. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is scheduled to consider preliminary approval of the accords around Nov. 8, with final approval to come later. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### That suggests any trial on remaining issues—government pollution claims, claims against BP's drilling partners, and claims among BP and those partners—would not begin until well into 2013, if not later. Judge Barbier is expected to meet with the parties behind closed doors on May 3 to discuss the case. ####  ##### BP shares closed down 6.5 pence (10.3 cents) at £4.48 ($7.10) in London, Reuters data show. ####  ##### Prior to the settlement, the lawyer Kenneth Feinberg had paid out $6.1 billion to spill victims who submitted claims under BP's $20 billion Gulf Coast Claims Facility. ####  ##### BP expects the $7.8 billion payment to come from that trust. Claimants with final offers from Feinberg can receive 60% of their money now, and if eligible under the new program may receive the remaining 40% or seek higher awards. ####  ##### Payouts are continuing, and being overseen by Patrick Juneau, a Lafayette, La., lawyer appointed by the court. ####  ##### ""The PSC seems to believe the court-appointed administrator will be more generous than Feinberg,"" said Tony Buzbee, a lawyer in Houston who said he represents 15,000 people and businesses with claims. ""I believe the $7.8 billion figure will grow."" ####  ##### Wednesday's settlements award $2.3 billion to commercial fishermen, seafood boat captains and others for damage related to shrimp, oysters, blue crab and other species. ####  ##### Another $57 million will be used to ""promote the Gulf Coast,"" including tourism and the seafood industry. ####  ##### Last week, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi asked Judge Barbier to delay preliminary approval to let potential plaintiffs, including various Florida claimants and others who might be left out, assess the ""fairness and rationale"" behind the accords. ####  ##### Mr. Buzbee expects the settlements to win approval, and said their structures may limit opposition. ####  ##### ""That payments continue even while the settlement is being reviewed takes away one of the primary arguments an objector might have,"" he said. ""That the (legal) fees will not come out of victims' pockets will take a lot of the fire out of the bellies of people who might have objected,"" he added. ####  ##### Jennifer Meale, a spokeswoman for Ms. Bondi, said her office is reviewing the settlements. Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Spokespeople for other Gulf states, Halliburton and Transocean had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Homeowner insurance app scares users";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Talk about too close to home. ####  ##### A Cardiff, Wales-based insurance marketer has launched a Facebook video app called “House of Horrors” that shows a burglar breaking into the viewer's own house. ####  ##### According to Confused.com, a comparative insurance website owned by auto insurer Admiral Group P.L.C., this is accomplished through a Google Maps image of the user's street that is displayed in the clip. Taking information from a user's profile, such as photos, the app places these around the house “to make them feel as though it is their own” residence being burglarized, Confused.com said in a statement. ####  ##### As if this were not enough, the video app lays on eerie music and a threatening burglar character who handles photos of the app user around the house and steals a laptop that displays the user's Facebook profile. The last shot shows the burglar holding a photo frame containing an image of the user, with the message, “Cover your possessions at Confused.com.” ####  ##### Sharon Flaherty, head of content at the website, said the video “is bound to make people feel uneasy as though their home really has been broken into. However, this is a situation which is very much a reality given that the British Crime Survey reported a 5% rise in burglary in the 12 months to September 2011.” ####  ##### “We're looking to spark conversation with this video app and make people understand the importance of having home insurance. With the current challenging financial times, people may stop insuring their possessions just to save a few pounds, but this is false economy,” Mike Hoban, marketing director at Confused.com, said in a statement. ####  ##### The statement, however, neither addresses the issue of why anyone would want to watch such a video nor does it give any word about insurance for the nightmares it may cause. #### "

In May, Mr. DelVecchio discharged ICM as his talent agency and allegedly refused to pay $370,000 in commissions owed to the Los Angeles-based talent company, according to court documents. ####  ##### “ICM went to bat for DelVecchio, successfully negotiating lucrative amendments to DelVecchio’s participation agreement with MTV,” ICM said in the lawsuit. “Now, DelVecchio and Blowout refuse to pay ICM nearly $400,000 in commissions on amounts Defendants already received.” ####  ##### “ICM was paid for its services,” Mr. DelVecchio’s attorneys, Hillary H. Hughes and Garvey Schubert Barer, said in news reports. “It is even more disappointing that an agency like ICM would choose to take advantage of its former relationship with a client and disclose his confidential business affairs to the public in disregard of any duties it owes as a talent agency.” ####  ##### ICM seeks damages no less than $370,000, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### If Mr. DelVecchio ends up paying the back commissions, it’ll be a bad hair day that no amount of gel could tame. #### "

"Japan to limit Iran oil voyages in Mideast Gulf-sources";"Risk Management";"European Union, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Middle East/Africa, Political Risk";" ##### TOKYO (Reuters)—Japanese insurers are warning ship owners that they will cover only one tanker at a time carrying Iranian crude oil through the Middle East Gulf due to tightening Western sanctions against OPEC's second biggest producer, industry sources said. ####  ##### The three major nonlife insurers—Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., Sompo Japan Insurance Inc. and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. Ltd.—are limited to how much they can provide in maritime coverage without tapping into the European reinsurance market. ####  ##### The European Union will prohibit European insurers and reinsurers from indemnifying tankers carrying Iranian crude oil anywhere in the world from July, threatening to curtail shipments and raise costs for major buyers. Japan and South Korea have lobbied for exemptions, but insurance and shipping executives say a complete ban now looks likely. ####  ##### The three insurers together can only provide up to 30 billion yen ($370 million) at one time in hull and machinery cover, which protects vessels against physical damage, without relying on the European reinsurance market to hedge their risk. ####  ##### That was enough to cover insurance for only one tanker traveling inside the Gulf with Iranian crude oil, the industry sources said. ####  ##### ""The Japanese buyers who load Iran crude need to share information about schedules for loading. They haven't done so previously,"" said an industry source familiar with the matter. ####  ##### The insurers will be able to cover only three or four tankers of Iranian crude oil a month, since each ship takes about a week to 10 days to travel in and out of the Middle East Gulf, sources said. ####  ##### That translates to 6 million to 8 million barrels per month, or about 200,000 to 267,000 barrels per day, but the volumes are likely to be lower than that because Japanese buyers typically do not fully load the tankers, the sources added. ####  ##### The Japan P&I Club, the country's main ship insurer against pollution and personal injury claims, also has been forced to reduce its cover for a tanker carrying Iranian oil to $8 million from July 1 from the current $1 billion due to E.U. sanctions. #### "

He was discharged when he refused to do so. ####  ##### The lawsuit charged the firm with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### Lynette A. Barnes, regional attorney for the EEOC's Charlotte, N.C., district, said in a statement, “No person should be forced to choose between his religion and his job when the company can provide an accommodation without suffering an undue hardship.” ####  ##### A company spokesman could not be reached for comment. #### "

"Britain seeks delay to E.U.'s Iran ship insurance ban";"Risk Management";"European Union, P/C Legislation & Regulation, P/C Insurers, Middle East/Africa, United Kingdom";" ##### LONDON (Reuters)—Britain is seeking to persuade fellow European Union members to postpone by up to six months a ban on providing insurance for tankers carrying Iranian oil, arguing that it could lead to a damaging spike in oil prices, European diplomats said. ####  ##### A European Union ban on importing Iranian oil, which takes effect on July 1, will also prevent E.U. insurers and reinsurers from covering tankers carrying its crude anywhere in the world. ####  ##### The impact of the measure is likely to be felt strongly in London's financial district, the centre for marine insurance. ####  ##### Iran exports most of its 2.2 million barrels of oil per day to Asia. The four main buyers—China, India, Japan and South Korea—have yet to find a way to replace the predominantly Western insurance shipping cover provided by London insurers. ####  ##### The sanctions seek to stem the flow of petrodollars to Tehran to force it to halt a nuclear program that the West suspects is intended to produce weapons. ####  ##### Some Indian and Chinese firms have already asked state insurers to step in and provide coverage by offering government guarantees. ####  ##### The situation is more complicated for Japan and South Korea, which have already cut imports of Iranian oil under pressure from Washington, but need Western protection and indemnity (P&I) ship insurance to continue importing the remaining volumes. ####  ##### ""Britain will be pushing the E.U. to postpone the ban on P&I insurance by six months,"" said one diplomatic source. ####  ##### ""The main reason is pressure from Japan and South Korea as they would struggle to buy oil after July 1,"" the source said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### He said Britain feared oil prices could rise sharply as a result of disruptions caused by the lack of insurance after July 1, as Japan and South Korea would be forced to bid aggressively for alternative supplies to meet their needs. ####  ##### A second European diplomatic source said he was aware of the British initiative. ####  ##### Both sources said Britain's proposal had yet to win support from other E.U. members, including France, which has been pushing for the toughest stance on Iran. ####  ##### But in Asia, some shippers welcomed the proposal. ####  ##### ""A six-month delay would give more time for alternative arrangements to be made or for the situation to become clearer,"" said Arthur Bowring, managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Assn. and a supporter of Britain's actions. ####  ##### ""It could also be an opening for a more permanent arrangement to be worked out."" ####  ##### It was not yet clear when the measure could be debated by E.U. officials as a meeting to review the embargo on Iranian oil has been rescheduled from the middle of May to an unspecified date. ####  ##### Japan, South Korea and India have lobbied E.U. officials for exemptions to the sanctions. ""One keeps hearing about positive developments on this issue, so we are hopeful that some positive outcome may come out,"" said S. Hajara, chairman of the Shipping Corp. of India. ####  ##### Negotiations between Iran and major world powers on nuclear issues resumed in Turkey in April after a 15-month hiatus.

"Ruling upheld in case of discrimination against deaf job applicant";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### NEW ORLEANS—An appellate court has upheld a jury verdict against a temporary staffing agency in a disability case brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in which the temp agency allegedly refused to consider a deaf job applicant for a position. ####  ##### According to the April 26 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission vs. Service Temps Inc., doing business as Smith Personnel Solutions, in June 2006, Jacquelyn Moncada, who is deaf from birth, applied for a job as a stock clerk to package cosmetics for a client of the Cleburne, Texas-based temp agency. She arranged for a sign language interpreter to meet her at the job site to translate as she applied for the position, according to the ruling. ####  ##### Carl Ray, a Smith Personnel account manager, “told her she could not apply for the position because she is deaf, that the warehouse environment would be too dangerous for her,” according to the ruling. ####  ##### Ms. Moncada filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in July 2006. After conciliation efforts failed, the issue eventually went to a jury trial. ####  ##### After a three-day trial in September 2010, the jury found Smith had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and awarded Ms. Moncada $14,400 in back pay, $20,000 in compensatory damages for emotional pain and suffering, and $150,000 in punitive damages. ####  ##### As a result of a subsequent motion, the punitive damages award was reduced to $68,800, but the court granted the EEOC injunctive relief, which required Smith to refrain from discriminating against disabled employees, among other provisions. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The temp agency appealed the trial court's decision based on several issues, including its imposition of injunctive relief, but was denied in a unanimous three-judge ruling of the appellate court. ####  ##### Smith “maintains that it should not have borne the burden of showing, essentially, that it would not violate the ADA in the future,” said the appellate court ruling. ####  ##### “In any event, Smith's argument only raises the question whether the district court was required to provide injunctive relief, not whether it had the discretion to do so, which it unquestionably did.” ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, plaintiffs attorney Paul W. Mollica, of counsel to law firm Outten & Golden L.L.P. in Chicago, who was not involved in the case, said the ruling is significant in part because EEOC hiring cases “tend to be scarce, so this is a very useful one.” ####  ##### It is also significant because of the appellate’ court’s ruling on the injunctive relief issue, he said. ####  ##### “The employer had the obligation to present not only a preponderance of evidence, but clear and convincing evidence” it would not to return to the same practice. It “failed to meet that burden at trial.” ####  ##### The judge held the injunction was mandatory, and the appellate court upheld that ruling, Mr. Mollica said.

"Company settles age discrimination lawsuit with EEOC for $400,000";"Risk Management";"";" ##### DALLAS—Central Freight Lines Inc. has agreed to settle an age discrimination lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of eight former dockworkers for $400,000, the agency said. ####  ##### The EEOC said last week that according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas, the Waco, Texas-based firm discriminated against the eight workers, who all were at least 50 years old, by selecting them for termination in an August 2007 reduction in force because of their age. ####  ##### The consolidated suit filed by EEOC and the private parties charged the workers were called names such as “grandpa,” “old farts” and more derogatory terms by their supervisor, who had been asked to prepare a list of the men to be terminated. ####  ##### The EEOC said also the company changed its attendance and disciplinary policy so the men “were suddenly put on corrective action and eligible for termination under the new policy,” the agency said in a statement. ####  ##### The company agreed to pay $400,000 to the claimants and to train management and supervisory personnel at the Central Freight Dallas and Fort Worth terminals on equal employment opportunity policies and procedures, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### “Central Freight treated these experienced dockworkers like they were expendable. This case shows that EEOC will remain vigilant in our protection of older workers,” EEOC attorney Suzanne M. Anderson said in the statement. ####  ##### Central Freight responded in a statement that it “has denied from the onset of this litigation that it discriminated” against the workers or violated any federal or state statute. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “These eight former employees were included in a reduction-in-force that was brought about by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business need,” it said. “Also included in the reduction-in-force were five other individuals, all under the age of 40, thereby demonstrating Central Freight's lack of discriminatory motive.' ####  ##### Referring to the EEOC not mentioning these other workers in its press release on the settlement, Central Freight said in its statement, “Given that this was an undisputed fact during the litigation, we cannot help but wonder whether the true motivation behind the press release was simply to attempt to paint Central Freight in a negative light. ####  ##### “Further absent from the press release is the fact that the sole reason that Central Freight, the plaintiffs, and the EEOC settled this matter, and entered into the consent decree, was to avoid the expense of further litigation.  This fact, as well as Central Freight's denial of discrimination, are explicitly contained in the consent decree, but were also conspicuously absent from the EEOC's press release. It is unfortunate that the EEOC chose to omit these crucial items in their press release.” ####  ##### Many observers have said the EEOC's recently issued guidance on age discrimination policies goes beyond the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on the issue and will add a burden to employers. #### "

In addition to replacing its legacy claims system with a Web-based offering, the commercial package insurer said it also implementing a ‘first notice of loss'—or FNOL—mobile application from Ravello. ####  ##### “Ravello's claims management system meets all of Millers' needs with respect to claims functionality and ease of integration with other system components,” Larry Fortin, chief information officer for Millers, said in a statement. “We are confident that Ravello will help us achieve our goal of providing a Web-based claims process with clean user interfaces.” ####  ##### In April, Westfield Center, Ohio-based Westfield Insurance Co. said it had selected the Guidewire ClaimCenter claims management system from San Mateo, Calif.-based Guidewire Software Inc. The insurer said it would implement ClaimCenter to support the management of its commercial, personal and workers' compensation lines throughout the 21 states in which it operates. Rob Bowers, Westfield Insurance's claims strategy leader, said the company wanted to create consistency in the claims handling processes across its organization and collect and utilize claims data for analytics. ####  ##### “We selected Guidewire based on its successful implementations at insurance carriers similar to us in terms of size and business focus,” Mr. Bowers said in a statement. “ClaimCenter is the proven solution to give us the flexibility we need to meet our current and future strategic objectives.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Sarasota, Fla.-based Universal North America Insurance Co. also had analytics in mind when it opted for a new in-house claims processing system from Atlanta-based iPartners L.L.C.

Watje, Universal North America's vp-operations and information technology, said in a statement. ####  ##### CNA Canada, a unit of Chicago-based CNA Financial Corp., also chose a cloud-based system when it purchased the STG Policy Administration offering from New York-based MajescoMastek, the U.S. subsidiary of Mumbai-based Mastek Ltd., in April. ####  ##### Lynne Von Wistinghausen, vp-operations and information technology for Toronto-based CNA Canada, said the new system was well-suited to handle the complexity of the company's niche commercial auto fleet line of business and would enable the insurer to better serve its broker partners. ####  ##### “MajescoMastek offered a best-fit solution with STG Policy Administration,” she said in a statement. “The cloud delivery is also proving to be an outstanding approach, enabling us to continue to grow our business by leveraging the best technology, but with a predictable and manageable cost structure.” #### "
"EEOC, Arizona school district settle discriminatory retirement plan charges";"Risk Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits";" ##### PHOENIX—An Arizona school district that was charged by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with having age discriminatory retirement plans has agreed to a $148,092 settlement. ####  ##### According to the EEOC, Tempe Elementary School District No. 3 used an early retirement incentive plan and a normal retirement plan that granted greater economic benefits to younger employees based solely on their age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. ####  ##### The school district's superintendent, Chris Bush, said Friday that its attorney-approved retirement policy had been in place for several decades with no complaint. But the agency said Thursday that as a result of its investigation and litigation, the school district has revised its retirement plans to comply with the ADEA. ####  ##### The school district also has agreed to pay workers who retired after April 3, 2008, the difference between what they received and what they should have been paid for those leave payouts had there been no unlawful discrimination. The settlement affects 49 retirees, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### The consent decree approved by a federal court in Phoenix also requires anti-discrimination training and a review of the school district's policies and practices, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### “Early retirement incentive plans and normal retirement plans which are facially discriminatory need to be changed,” EEOC Regional Attorney Mary Jo O'Neill said in a statement. “Discrimination on the basis of age is simply illegal. People in their 60s should not be penalized merely because they want to continue working. A retirement plan which states, for example, that employees 52 years old will receive a greater economic benefit than an employee 61 years old for retiring early is discriminatory on its face.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Ms. Bush said the school district had a policy for several decades under which school employees who retired at age 55 received 52% of their salary, a percentage that declined as they got older. The policy had been reviewed by attorneys, she said. ####  ##### “As far back as we can investigate, we think that it was a policy designed to incentivize employees back when we all had the early incentive programs,” said Ms. Bush. “No employees ever brought it to our attention, nobody every argued with it. Everybody retired and took their money and went on their way,” she said. ####  ##### “In 2010, the EEOC determined that the policy itself would possibly be discriminatory and launched an investigation, and the minute the EEOC made us aware of it, we changed the policy, and so everybody who's retired is paid at 52% of their daily rate of payment,” she said. ####  ##### “We've always been very generous to our retirees. We value them,” Ms. Bush added. ####  ##### The EEOC recentlY issued guidance on age discrimination policies that many observers say goes beyond the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on the issue. #### "

In addition, the suit asserts that these purloined items are being marketed in conjunction with a weight-loss program called the “P.I.N.K.” (Power, Intensity, Nutrition and Kardio) method created by Cynthia Pasquella, a former fitness competitor who is unrelated to the gym. ####  ##### The dispute began after an agreement reached in January between Pink Iron gym owner Ms. Holton and Pink Iron Home Fitness President Scott Waterbury fell apart, and Mr. Waterbury changed the name of his company to P.I.N.K. Method after incorporating Ms. Pasquella’s diet program. ####  ##### The P.I.N.K. Method diet has become a commercial hit after selling 150,000 copies in just three months, thanks to being promoted on the “Dr. Phil Show,” the lawsuit states. ####  ##### Moreover, “it does not appear to be a coincidence that defendant Pink Iron Home Fitness’ spokesperson, Holly Holton, and defendant P.I.N.K. Method’s spokesperson, Cynthia Pasquella, share a striking resemblance,” according to the complaint. ####  ##### In addition to naming Jay McGraw, the lawsuit also names his publishing company, M Print Publishing Inc., along with Mr. Waterbury and the creator of the P.I.N.K. weight-loss program. ####  ##### It does not, however, name Dr. Phil. #### "
"EEOC wins summary judgment in retaliation case against BASF unit";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### URBANA, Ill.—A federal judge has ruled that a BASF Corp. unit unlawfully retaliated against an employee for refusing to waive his rights to file a discrimination charge, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said. ####  ##### The lawsuit was filed by the EEOC in August 2010 against Cognis Corp., which was acquired in December 2010 by Florham, N.J.-based BASF Corp., a North American affiliate of Ludwigshafen, Germany-based chemical company BASF S.E. ####  ##### A summary judgment ruling by Judge Michael P. McCuskey of U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois in Urbana, announced Wednesday, was issued May 23. ####  ##### The EEOC charged Cognis with retaliating against Steven Whitlow, a 19-year employee in its Kankakee, Ill., facility, by requiring him to sign a “last-chance” employment agreement that prohibited him from filing a discrimination charge with the EEOC, even if it was based on conduct that might occur in the future. ####  ##### The court found the company fired Mr. Whitlow when he refused to be bound by the agreement. The EEOC said the only remaining issue for trial with regard to Mr. Whitlow is the amount of damages due to him. ####  ##### The EEOC also charged that a class of employees who signed similar last-chance agreements was also retaliated against, because Cognis forced the workers to make a choice between termination and signing. The court denied the EEOC's summary judgment motion for these employees, and those claims will now proceed to trial, the EEOC said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### EEOC Chicago district director John Rowe said in a statement, “Filing EEOC charges? is a fundamental right of American employees, and this agency always stands ready to protect that fight. This court’s opinion should cause employers to remember that seeking to dissuade employees from exercising that right is not only bad policy, it’s a violation of federal law which can give rise to very substantial liability.” ####  ##### BASF said in a statement that it “respectfully disagrees with the Court’s ruling with respect to Mr. Whitlow and is evaluating its immediate options. BASF Corp. is deeply committed to equal employment opportunity and takes its responsibilities for compliance with all federal, state and local laws seriously. This commitment includes maintaining a vigorous compliance program to ensure our high standards are met consistently throughout the organization.” #### "
"Property/casualty insurers upgrading policy administration systems: Analysis";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Tech Insights";" ##### Economic and market conditions are encouraging property/casualty insurers to replace or upgrade policy administration systems, according to a report from New York-based research and advisory services firm Novarica released last week. ####  ##### The report, “Novarica Market Navigator: US Property/Casualty Policy Administration Systems 2012 (Q2),” analyzes the factors prompting policy administration replacement and also profiles 58 property/casualty-specific policy administration systems. ####  ##### Authored by Novarica partner Chad Hersh and Novarica analyst Lis Maguda, the report said while the need to improve customer-facing technologies until recently was a priority mainly for personal lines insurers, commercial lines insurers are now feeling pressured by evolving customer expectations around functions such as quoting and claims management. According to earlier Novarica research, roughly a third of insurers are currently replacing or planning to replace a policy administration system. ####  ##### “On the commercial side, the rise of online self-service across many consumer industries has raised the expectations of users in general, forcing carriers to provide certain online capabilities even for lines of business that just a few years ago seemed safe from such requirements,” the report states. “Inflexible legacy policy administration systems can prevent insurers from being able to take advantage of new opportunities and being able to meet customer and agent expectations.” ####  ##### Mr. Hersh and Ms. Maguda say modern administration systems are constructed to enable increased data accessibility, which can aid in areas such as regulatory reporting as well as providing data for models used in everything from rates/pricing to fraudulent claim detection. ####  ##### Moreover, they say that a modern system may help reduce long-term total cost of ownership as finding information technology staff to maintain legacy system becomes more difficult as the systems age. ####  ##### “Attracting and retaining IT staff and even front- and back-office employees is also increasingly important as today's job seekers increasingly lack the skills—or the desire—to work on 30+ year-old systems,” the report states. #### "
"Social media has immediate impact on insurance industry: Experts";"Risk Management";"Tech Insights";" ##### Of all the major technology trends impacting the insurance industry, the ramifications of the rise of social media as a cultural force may well be the most immediate. ####  ##### While the recent Facebook IPO debacle has done much to tarnish the shine of the pioneering social media company, social technologies already are beginning to have a profound impact on the insurance industry, experts say. ####  ##### Insurance companies have long leveraged social platforms for marketing and brand building, but now they also are finding that social mediums furnish a bounty of data that can be used to improve the underwriting and claims process. For example, social data is especially useful in helping insurance companies ferret out claims fraud, said Stephen Applebaum, a senior analyst at Boston-based independent research and advisory firm Aite Group L.L.C. ####  ##### “Social data is a new pool of information for fraud research that hasn't really been tapped,” Mr. Applebaum said during a panel discussion held at The Insurance Accounting Systems Assn. Inc.'s annual conference in San Diego on Tuesday. “It's economically productive for insurers to mine that data.” ####  ##### Fellow panelist Max Drucker, CEO and president of Social Intelligence Corp., a social media screening and investigative services firm based in Santa Barbara, Calif., cited an example where a workers compensation insurer used social media to uncover a fraudulent claim. A warehouse worker who claimed to have injured his arm also played guitar in a bar band. After spotting an advertisement for his show on Myspace, the insurance company sent an investigator to photograph the concert and subsequently denied the claim. “Social media can be the smoking gun, but it is best used in conjunction with other things,” Mr. Drucker said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Moreover, Mr. Drucker noted that people often have complex online identities involving multiple social platforms and email addresses. “There's a ton of information out there and it's not all on Facebook,” he said. ####  ##### In addition to insurance companies utilizing social media platforms aimed at consumers, there also are social technologies built expressly for enterprises. Austin, Texas-based ProspX Inc. provides a collaborative software platform built for the insurance industry. ProspX President and CEO Todd L. Young said that social technologies are well suited to help streamline complex collaborative processes and gather and filter information and expertise on a given topic. “We have built a business social system for commercial insurance that helps bring in just the relevant information based on the opportunity the producer or broker is working on,” Mr. Young said. ####  ##### Historically, technologies gestated in the enterprise before reaching the public. Social media and mobile technologies have inverted that trend. While the consumer market eventually may abandon Facebook in the years ahead, the use of social technologies by insurers is likely here to stay. #### "

""We can trade with no problems at all everywhere in Asia."" ####  ##### He declined to give figures for shipments, however, and his comments contrasted with evidence from Asian buyers that they were significantly scaling back purchases from Iran. These included a senior Chinese oil executive who said this week that refiner Sinopec will cut imports by up to one-fifth this year. ####  ##### Iran-based shipping sources said in April that Iran had been forced to deploy more than half of its national tanker fleet to store oil at anchorage due to the Western measures. ####  ##### The National Iranian Tanker Co.—now known as NITC—lost its ship insurance cover from European providers last year due to Western sanctions imposed on Iran. It secured alternative cover mainly in Asia and also in Iran from privately owned Kish P&I. ####  ##### ""We have $1 billion (in protection and indemnity cover). We can trade and go everywhere,"" the official said. ####  ##### ""That is equivalent to the standard (industry cover)...and is acceptable to the shipping community,"" said the official, who declined to be named. ####  ##### Protection and indemnity (P&I) clubs, owned by their shipowner customers, were created to cover shipping companies against personal injury or environmental cleanup claims, dauntingly large costs for most commercial insurers. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Kish P&I relies on state-run Central Insurance of Iran as its reinsurer. Any claim made against it would likely have to go through a sanctioned bank. Nevertheless, Kish has said it is confident it would be able to pay Western ship industry claims in the event of accidents. ####  ##### By comparison, Japan's government submitted a bill on Monday to allow it to provide insurance for Iranian crude imports, which would enable it to make direct payments of up to $7.6 billion in the event of an incident involving a tanker bound for Japan. ####  ##### The U.S. government aims to aims to choke off Tehran's oil revenue and force a halt to nuclear development it believes is aimed at making weapons. ####  ##### On Monday, Washington added India and South Korea, but not China, to a list of countries exempt from sanctions that begin on June 28—cutting companies off from the U.S. financial system. It noted they had made significant cuts in oil imports from Iran. ####  ##### Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. ####  ##### In April, two Iran-based shipping sources said Iran had been forced to deploy more than half its fleet to store oil at anchorage in the Gulf, equating to 33 million barrels. Other industry sources have also estimated that Iran could be storing tens of millions of barrels of oil on tankers. ####  ##### Asked how many vessels his company was using to store Iranian oil, the NITC official said: ""It is not many."" ####  ##### Last month the U.S. Senate approved a package of new economic sanctions on Iran's oil sector that would extend measures to dealings with NITC and the National Iranian Oil Co., if they are deemed to be an agent or affiliate of the Revolutionary Guards. ####  ##### It aims to close a potential loophole that could have allowed Tehran to continue selling some of its oil using its own fleet. NITC has denied any link to the Revolutionary Guards. ####  ##### ""NITC is a legitimate company and we think it is not fair that NITC should be targeted. We are not involved with the speculation that has been suggested,"" the official said. #### "

"Racial discrimination lawsuit against Humana reinstated ";"Risk Management";"";" ##### CINCINNATI—A federal appeals court has reinstated a putative class action racial discrimination case brought by a former Humana Inc. employee in a technical legal ruling. ####  ##### According to Monday's 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Kathryn Keys vs. Humana Inc., Ms. Keys, a former director at the Louisville, Ky.-based health insurer who is African-American, stated that after two reorganizations, her role and responsibilities had been diminished unlike those of Caucasian directors. ####  ##### Humana terminated Ms. Keys' employment in June 2008, citing a 2006 negative performance assessment and ignoring a 2007 favorable performance appraisal, according to the ruling. Ms. Keys filed a lawsuit against Humana in October 2009. ####  ##### A district court dismissed the suit in July 2010, concluding that Ms. Keys had failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. ####  ##### This framework, which stems from a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonnell Douglas Corp. vs. Green, states that to establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must establish that she is member of a protected class; that she was qualified for her job; that she suffered an adverse employment decision; and that she was replaced by a person from outside the protected class, or treated differently than similarly situated nonprotected employees. ####  ##### The district court found Ms. Keys had failed to meet the last qualification. ####  ##### However, the appellate court said the district court had incorrectly applied the McDonnell Douglas framework in its ruling because it should be used as a standard to evaluate evidence, not merely to plead a case. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “The district court's requiring that Keys' complaint establish a prima facie cause under McDonnell Douglas and its progeny is contrary to Supreme Court and 6th Circuit precedent,” said a three-judge panel's unanimous ruling. ####  ##### Citing the Supreme Court's 2002 ruling in Swierkiewicz vs. Sorema N.A., the appellate court said, “The Supreme Court unanimously held that the prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas is an evidentiary standard, not a pleading standard…As the court reasoned, 'it is not appropriate to require a plaintiff to plead facts establishing a prima facie case because the McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply in every employment discrimination case.” ####  ##### “Keys adequately alleged the components of her claim and of her class action case, both of which now may be defined further through the discovery process,” the court said, in remanding the case. ####  ##### A Humana spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### Commenting on the ruling, Jonathan T. Hyman, a partner with law firm Kohrman Jackson & Krantz P.L.L. in Cleveland, who was not involved in the case, said the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which sets out pleading standards for complaints filed in federal court, “simply requires a short and plain statement of the claim.” ####  ##### As federal courts become more comfortable analyzing discrimination claims, the need of the McDonnell Douglas analysis is “falling by the wayside,” he said. ####  ##### In a related ruling, the 6th Circuit late last month upheld an award to an African-American custodian who accused a school district of racial discrimination and retaliation in connection with his demotion and transfer to another school in Clifford Litton vs. Talawanda School District. #### "

"Dai-ichi, Korea Life bid for ING's Southeast Asia business ";"Risk Management";"European Union, Asia-Pacific & Australasia, Australia & New Zealand";" ##### (Reuters)—Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and Korea Life were first out of the blocks to submit second-round bids on Monday for ING's insurance operations in Southeast Asia, as the Dutch insurer moves to divest its Asian operations. ####  ##### Binding bids for ING's Asian insurance and asset management operations are due on Monday and a wide range of suitors, from the son of Asia's richest man and a former rugby player in New Zealand to more established players including AIA Group and Manulife Financial Corp, are expected to place offers in a deal worth about $7 billion. ####  ##### ING is selling its businesses in the region as it needs to repay a bailout from the Dutch government during the 2008 financial crisis. Since the bailout, ING has sold €15.2 billion ($18.6 billion) worth of assets around the world. ####  ##### “Yes, Dai-ichi made an offer,” one source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The source declined to be identified as the matter was not public. ####  ##### Korea Life has also submitted bid for ING's a Southeast Asian operations, a South Korean report said on Monday. ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian business have been in hot demand, and the business could fetch about $2 billion, one person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Life insurance premiums in Southeast Asia are forecast to grow rapidly on the back of strong economic growth. ####  ##### Dai-ichi and other Japanese insurers are under growing pressure to expand overseas as they face weak growth prospect at home. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A spokesman for Dai-ichi and Korea Life declined to comment. ####  ##### KB Financial Group submitted a bid for ING's South Korean insurance business, the local Maeil Business Newspaper reported. ####  ##### ING chief executive Jan Hommen scrapped a joint IPO of its Europe and Asia units in favor of an Asian sale about six months ago. Since then, the worsening euro zone crisis has put some potential buyers off big merger and acquisition bets. Metlife and Prudential Financial Inc., considered strong contenders for ING's insurance business, have dropped out of the process. ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian operations were also expected to draw second-round bids for parts of the business from two other groups, sources familiar with the process said. ####  ##### One consortium is led by ex-AIA CEO and a former rugby player Mark Wilson, backed by private equity firm Blackstone Group L.P. and Swiss Re Ltd., while the other is headed by Richard Li, son of billionaire Li Ka-shing, which is likely to be interested only in the Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand businesses. ####  ##### Wilson was in charge of AIA when it planned an initial public offering in 2009, but was replaced the next year after a failed bid for AIA by British insurer Prudential P.L.C. ####  ##### There is some skepticism over either consortium having a chance of winning. ####  ##### “It gets complicated when you bring a private equity fund into the picture,” said Hong Kong-based Keefe, Bruyette & Woods insurance analyst Stanley Tsai. “They will need an exit strategy in the next two to three years, making the deal more difficult to execute from a regulatory standpoint.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ING's Southeast Asian operations could be sold at nearly two times embedded value, one source said. South Korea and Japan account for about two-thirds of ING's Asian business, but Japan may prove to be a stumbling block in the auction due to the €18 billion ($21.9 billion) worth of high-guarantee variable annuity policies the local operation has on its books. ####  ##### The companies mentioned in this report either declined to comment or were not available for immediate comment. ####  ##### Monday's binding bids could set the stage for a final round of negotiations, after which ING will decide whether to sell the life business en bloc or break it up and sell Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia separately. ING has not set a reserve price, and CEO Hommen said in May that Asian divestments would probably fetch less than €8 billion ($9.80 billion). ####  ##### Nomura Holdings is helping ING to find a solution for its Japanese operations, while Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are advising ING on the rest of the auction. ####  ##### Manulife may bid for the entire Asian operation, while AIA is interested in South Korea and Southeast Asia, sources said. Though some sources said, the Canadian financial company could also skip Japan. ####  ##### ING's Asia operations offer a platform for insurers keen to expand in a region enjoying rapid economic growth. Life insurance premiums in emerging Asia are forecast to grow 8.7% next year, nearly double the world average, according to Swiss Re estimates. ####  ##### Binding bids for ING's asset management business are also due this week, with Nikko Asset Management, U.S.-based Principal Financial Group, Royal Bank of Canada, Singapore's United Overseas Bank and Manulife expected to participate. The asset management sale is expected to fetch about $600 million. #### "

"Catastrophe bond issuance totals $2.1B in second quarter: Aon Benfield";"Risk Management";"Aon Benfield";" ##### Capital continues to flow into the reinsurance industry via catastrophe bonds, according to a report released Wednesday by reinsurance intermediary Aon Benfield Inc. ####  ##### The report, “Insurance-Linked Securities Second Quarter Update 2012,” notes that seven catastrophe bond transactions totaling $2.1 billion closed during the quarter. The transactions feature both new and repeat sponsors and continue a trend of capital moving into the sector via ILS, the unit of London-based Aon P.L.C. noted. ####  ##### Two Japanese cedents, Tokyo-based Zenkyoren Ltd. and Tokyo-based Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. Ltd., returned to the market in 2012. “Japan sponsors continue to utilize catastrophe bonds as part of their overall risk transfer program,” the report states. ####  ##### The report also notes a renewed interest from European insurers in ILS in light of uncertainty caused by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis and the pending Solvency II regulatory framework. ####  ##### “This high level of uncertainty has increased concern among many cedents about the security of traditional reinsurance and the potential for a shortfall on recoveries following a major catastrophe,” the report states. “Although the overall probability of a failure to pay is very small, risk managers and sponsors alike are increasingly taking a more prudent approach to counterparty credit risk.” ####  ##### Paul Schultz, CEO of Aon Benfield Securities, noted that the total issuance for the first half of 2012 were very close to record levels. ####  ##### “Issuance for the first half stood at $3.6 billion, which was just short of the all-time high of $3.8 billion achieved during the same period in 2007,” Mr. Schultz said in a statement. “The pipeline for the remainder of 2012 remains strong, and we are pleased to see healthy levels of capital inflows from both seasoned investors and newer entrants to the ILS sector.” #### "

"Banks in Libor probe consider group settlement: Sources";"Risk Management";"";" ##### (Reuters)—A group of banks being investigated in an interest-rate rigging scandal are looking to pursue a group settlement with regulators rather than face a Barclays P.L.C.-style backlash by going it alone, people familiar with the banks' thinking said. ####  ##### Such discussions are preliminary, and it is unclear if regulators will enter these talks, aimed at resolving allegations that banks attempted to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars in contracts. ####  ##### Still, there are powerful incentives for the banks to enter joint negotiations. ####  ##### Barclays was the first to settle with U.S. and British regulators, paying a $453 million penalty and admitting to its role in a deal announced June 27. Its chief executive, Bob Diamond, abruptly quit the next week, bowing to public pressure and erosion of the bank's reputation. ####  ##### The sources told Reuters that none of the banks involved now want to be second in line for fear that they will get similarly hostile treatment from politicians and the public. Bank discussions about a group settlement initially took place before the Barclays agreement, and picked back up in the aftermath. ####  ##### It is unclear which banks are involved in the potential settlement talks. More than a dozen banks are being investigated in the scandal, including Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings P.L.C., Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co. They all declined to comment. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### A group agreement would appeal to financial watchdogs because they would be able to announce a headline-grabbing figure, showing that they were dealing firmly with the banking industry's misdemeanors, a banker told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ####  ##### Earlier this year, five top U.S. banks negotiated a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and other federal and state agencies to resolve allegations of mortgage services abuses. ####  ##### The key regulators involved in the Libor case include the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Britain's Financial Services Authority. The CFTC was not available for comment, and the FSA declined to comment. ####  ##### The main obstacle facing such a group settlement is hesitancy on the part of the investment banks to work together in the fevered atmosphere surrounding the Libor investigations. Negotiations and haggling could drag on for some time and a resolution was far from certain, the banker said. ####  ##### The fact that each bank possibly had to settle with a different group of regulators, and that the charges were different in each case also made the chances of success of such a settlement small, a source at one of the banks being probed said. ####  ##### However, if they were able to reach a group settlement it would enable them to share the pain of negative publicity. ####  ##### While Barclays received a 30% ""discount"" on the fines for cooperating fully with authorities, it sustained far more serious damage with the subsequent loss of its top management and a public pillorying at the hands of politicians. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The specter of severe penalties from regulators and the possibility of multi-billion dollar class action suits has hung over more than a dozen banks being investigated worldwide since the extent of attempts to rig Libor became clear in CFTC and FSA documents released with the Barclays settlement. ####  ##### Analysts have estimated that the scandal could cost the industry between $20 billion to $40 billion, further damaging a sector that is struggling to work its way through the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, economic downturns in Europe and the United States, and increased regulatory demands. ####  ##### Libor rates are set daily in London for a range of currencies and maturities. Banks submit rates for unsecured loans to one another and the rates after high and low rates are thrown out, are averaged. ####  ##### Among the Barclays disclosures that sparked outrage were emails that showed employees asking for the submitted rates to be changed. ####  ##### ""Done...for you big boy,"" read a message sent by a Barclays banker to one of the lender's traders, who had asked him to fix Libor at an artificially low level. ####  ##### ""Dude, I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I'm opening a bottle of Bollinger,"" a trader from another firm emailed a banker at Barclays, showing his thanks for the rate set artificially low. ####  ##### The unfolding scandal also has raised questions about what the regulators knew and what actions they took to rein in the activity. Documents released by the Fed show it was repeatedly warned about Libor manipulation. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In 2008, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who was then head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, sent a private email to Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King advising him of concerns about the rate's integrity and suggesting six ways to improve it. Mr. King passed the suggestions along and minor changes were made, according to documents released last week. ####  ##### Earlier this week, Mr. King put the Libor issue on the agenda of the Economic Consultative Committee of global central bankers that will meet in Basel, Switzerland, on Sept. 9. ####  ##### Libor rates underpin an estimated $550 trillion in financial products, including consumer loans, mortgages, municipal bonds and corporate paper. They are also considered a gauge of a bank's health. Investigators are looking at whether banks low-balled the rates to hide their borrowing costs in the 2007-09 financial crisis, and to profit on trades before the crisis hit. ####  ##### The scandal has also raised questions if Libor should be calculated differently. In Asia, the Hong Kong Assn. of Banks said it was reviewing the mechanism for determining its Hibor benchmark. ####  ##### The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was examining the setting of the Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor), widely used in the pricing of mortgages and other loans in the city-state. ####  ##### The Japanese banking industry lobby has asked the 18 banks contributing to the Tokyo interbank offered rate (Tibor) to check whether correct procedures were being followed, although the group's head said he did not believe there was a problem. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Banks on the Libor panel submit rates based on their estimates of how much it costs them to borrow from each other. The rate is thus subjective, as opposed to basing the benchmarks more on actual lending rates, so less manipulation is possible. The Australian Bank Bill Swaps Reference Rates, for example, are based on where paper is actually traded on the market. ####  ##### The issue is similar for Euribor—launched with the single currency in 1999—prompting the ECB to call for a re-think, including possibly shifting the basis of the calculation to actual lending rates. #### "
"As crop losses mount, farmers seen quicker to claim ";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers";" ##### (Reuters)—The drought ravaging America's prime farmland is having an unexpected consequence that could shape the future of agricultural finance: In some cases, farmers who have amped up their insurance coverage may be giving up on their crops early rather than to trying to save them. ####  ##### Anecdotal evidence and economic assumptions suggest that a record number of farmers are likely preparing to file insurance claims this year, opting to plow under their withered crops—some without bothering to administer the costly pesticides and weed killers that might help salvage a dwindling harvest. ####  ##### Call it ""moral hazard"" in the heartland: with the growing use of federally backed crop insurance, a shift toward larger policies and newer schemes that protect revenue, some experts say farmers may now be better off claiming a total loss than eking out a shrunken harvest—a move that could exacerbate a 50% surge in corn prices by further reducing supply. ####  ##### ""Why spend money trying to save a crop when every bushel of crop you save is then going to reduce the indemnity that you would otherwise receive?"" said Vince Smith, an economist at Montana State University who has been critical of the program. ####  ##### ""The higher level of coverage means that you need a small shortfall in yield in order to be eligible for an indemnity payment, so these moral hazard effects come into effect more frequently,"" he said, referring to the economic theory in which one party may take excessive risk to the detriment of another. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Indemnified losses are likely to significantly exceed last year's record $10.7 billion, experts say, a sum that will be shared by the government programs that subsidize the dozen or so specialist crop insurance firms that sell the policies. ####  ##### Consumers across the world also will pay at the grocery store: as more farmers give up, the corn crop shrinks, propelling prices even further beyond last year's $8 a bushel. Some analysts began revising down their crop estimates this week on the basis that millions of acres may not be harvested at all. ####  ##### As it plays out, the trend may have far-reaching implications in Washington, where Congress is in the final furlong of hammering out a multiyear farm bill—the cornerstone of which was expected to be an expanded insurance scheme, something that now faces even greater scrutiny. ####  ##### The growth in crop insurance is well documented. A decade ago, insurance covered about 75% of the U.S. corn crop; last year it covered 85% of all planted acres. ####  ##### But more importantly, farmers also have been shifting toward policies that offer a greater level of protection. ####  ##### In 2004, farmers who took out policies at 75% or more coverage represented less than 40% of the total sum of insured acres. By last year that share had risen to 63%, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency data compiled by Thomson Reuters Lanworth, a natural resources intelligence firm. ####  ##### While it is too early to see any definitive evidence of the total indemnity costs, early data supports anecdotal reports of greater activity. As of July 16, insurance indemnities for all crops stand at $446 million compared with $230 million at this time a year ago, according to RMA data. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### At the same time, U.S. corn production is shrinking by the hour amid the worst drought in more than 50 years. The government slashed its production forecast by 12% just last week; by this week, analysts said output had likely fallen a further 7% due to the drought. ####  ##### It is not just the level of coverage that matters; the type is also key. ####  ##### Disaster modeling company AIR Worldwide, in a recent report on the drought, said most farmers in the Corn Belt took out revenue protection policies with a harvest price option—contracts that will, in other words, pay them for the crops they would have harvested at the price they would have gotten at market even if they plow under instead. ####  ##### To be sure, for every farmer thinking about cashing in on their insurance there are plenty who are still fighting the fight. Ben Hollis, who farms corn and soybeans in Petersburg, Ill., raised his revenue protection level this year and held off on fungicide as a waste of money—but he is adamant the two are not linked. ####  ##### ""If you continually try to raise (a) poor crop and cash in on your insurance, then you'll have a terrible average. I would resent the idea that I would ignore pesticide or fungicide because I have insurance,"" he said. ""I want to produce something. When I do something I want to do it right."" ####  ##### For the most part, it is too early to see direct evidence of abandoned crops. Farmers generally must receive confirmation of their claim from the insurer before destroying their fields, and the speed of the drought is straining adjusters who would normally be busy only after the autumn harvest. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""Insurance claims are coming in like it's the fall,"" says Washington-based agricultural trade consultant John Baize, who has worked closely with farmers for over three decades. ####  ##### Lanworth crop scouts toured more than 50 fields across northern Iowa, and dozens more in southern Illinois and northeastern Missouri, over the past two weeks without observing any plowed-under fields, they said. ####  ##### However there was little doubt of widespread losses, potentially exceeding the drought of 1988 when more than 5% of planted acres in Iowa were not harvested in Iowa. ####  ##### ""We observed fields in northwestern Iowa with cracks in the soil nine inches long and one and a half inches deep—what this crop needs is weeks of rain to abate the dry soil conditions,"" says Lanworth senior analyst Alexis Maxwell. Some fields had almost no pollinated ears of corn, she said. ####  ##### ""We saw a few crop dusters. It looks like some farmers just cannot give up hope on this crop and are trying to save it, but what we really need is not fertilizer but days of rain."" ####  ##### Still, the economics of calling in the insurance claims adjuster are growing more attractive daily. ####  ##### If the fall harvest price is $8 a bushel, a farmer who has 80% insurance coverage and an actual production history of 180 bushels an acre would get $1,152 an acre if their field is a total loss and they did not sell any crops forward, according to Iowa State University economist Bruce Babcock. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Babcock noted that in the spring, when corn was planted, prices were around $5 a bushel. The farmer who thought he would get his 180 bushel/acre yield at that $5 price was expecting to make $900 an acre. ####  ##### ""So, in fact, this farmer with insurance may actually come out ahead if his field is a total loss and he did not forward contract the crop,"" Mr. Babcock said in an email interview. ####  ##### Policies require farmers to notify insurance companies of crop damage within 15 days, adjusters say. But it can be difficult to know when the damage begins in situations like a drought, where stalks wilt a little bit more with every day. ####  ##### After being notified, insurance adjusters visit clients' farms to assess the extent of the damage. They can cover about 1,200 acres in a day, which includes driving from field to field and surveying conditions, said Mark Mossman, vp of claims for NAU Country Insurance Co. #### "
"Swiss regulator quizzes Credit Suisse, UBS on Libor";"Risk Management";"Switzerland";" ##### ZURICH (Reuters)—Swiss regulator FINMA said it is questioning UBS A.G. and Credit Suisse Group in an investigation over possible Libor interest rate rigging. ####  ##### ""We are actively going after information that will enable us to make a judgment on what has happened,"" a spokesman for the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority told Reuters on Monday. ####  ##### The two banks are not under formal investigation, as Swiss banks are legally obliged to cooperate with FINMA, which regulates the country's banks. ####  ##### Credit Suisse said on July 16 it did not expect a ""material"" impact from the regulatory probe. ####  ##### UBS, which is already being investigated by the Swiss competition authority WEKO over its role in the Libor scandal, said in its first quarter report it has been granted conditional leniency or conditional immunity from authorities in certain jurisdictions. ####  ##### These include the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and WEKO and relate to potential antitrust or competition law violations related to submissions for Yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor. ####  ##### UBS is reporting second quarter results on Tueday at 0445 GMT. ####  ##### Should FINMA conclude that the banks violated Swiss regulations, it can demand changes both at organizational and managerial level. ####  ##### The spokesman also said that Swiss authorities were in close contact with investigators around the world. ""We have already granted administrative assistance,"" he said. ####  ##### People familiar with the investigations around the world told Reuters last week that U.S. prosecutors and European regulators are close to arresting individual traders and charging them with colluding to manipulate global benchmark interest rates. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In Europe, financial regulators are focusing on a ring of traders from several European banks who allegedly sought to rig benchmark interest rates such as Libor, said the European source familiar with the investigation in Europe. ####  ##### The London Interbank Offered Rate underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets. ####  ##### Activity in the Libor investigation, which has been going on for three years, has quickened since Barclays agreed last month to pay $453 million in fines and penalties to settle allegations with regulators and prosecutors that some of its employees tried to manipulate key interest rates from 2005 through 2009. #### "
"Appeals court revives U.S. farmers' suit over milk prices ";"Risk Management";"";" ##### SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters)—Milk farmers can proceed with a class action accusing dairy product manufacturers of manipulating the price of raw milk, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. ####  ##### The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco revived a lawsuit brought by dairy farmers accusing milk powder supplier DairyAmerica Inc. of understating its prices to the U.S. Agriculture Department. That misinformation depressed raw milk prices, shortchanging American dairy farmers millions of dollars between 2002 and 2007, the suit alleged. ####  ##### Manufacturers like DairyAmerica are required to report their product prices to the USDA, which uses the information to set prices paid to farmers under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. ####  ##### In 2007, a dairy industry publication, The Milkweed, revealed that DairyAmerica had undervalued its nonfat dry milk by illegally incorporating the low prices from long-term contracts in its reports to the USDA. ####  ##### Four farmers, Gerald Carlin, John Rahm, Paul Rozwadowski and Bryan Wolfe, sued DairyAmerica and its majority owner California Dairies Inc. in 2009 on behalf of milk farmers around the country. ####  ##### In 2010, a federal court in Fresno dismissed the case, finding that suit was barred under the ""filed rate doctrine"" which prevents people from suing over rates filed with and reviewed by government agencies. The judge-created law, often used to defend against price-fixing suits, prevents courts from second-guessing agencies' expertise. ####  ##### But the 9th Circuit on Tuesday decided that the rule did not bar the farmers' suit because the USDA had investigated DairyAmerica's conduct and found its reported rates improper. The total value of raw milk was understated by $50 million between 2006 and 2007, according to an agency report. ####  ##### The appeals court said the case was exceptional due to the large and undisputed scope of the misreporting and the fact that the USDA recognized the rates as incorrect and would not produce a flood of cases. ####  ##### ""Our holding will not permit a flood of litigation such that the filed rate doctrine will be circumvented every time a milk producer has a quibble with FMMO prices,"" Judge George Wu wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. ####  ##### Benjamin Brown, a lawyer at Cohen Milstein who represented the farmers, welcomed the decision and the opportunity to proceed with the case before the district court. ####  ##### Neither DairyAmerica nor the company's lawyer, Charles English of Davis Wright Tremaine, immediately responded to requests for comment. ####  ##### John Vlahos of Hanson Bridgett, who represents California Dairies, was not immediately available to comment. #### "
"N.Y. says 'rogue' bank hid $250B in Iran deals, may pull license";"Risk Management";"United Kingdom";" ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—New York's top bank regulator threatened to strip Standard Chartered P.L.C. of its state banking license, saying the British bank was a ""rogue institution"" that hid $250 billion in transactions tied to Iran, in violation of U.S. law. ####  ##### The New York State Department of Financial Services said Standard Chartered ""schemed"" with the Iranian government and hid from law enforcement officials some 60,000 secret transactions to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees over nearly 10 years, also exposing the U.S. banking system to terrorists, drug traffickers and corrupt states. ####  ##### The loss of a New York banking license would be a devastating blow for a foreign bank, effectively cutting off direct access to the U.S. bank market. Standard Chartered processes $190 billion every day for global clients, the New York bank regulator said. ####  ##### In an unusual look inside a bank, the regulator described how Standard Chartered officials debated whether to continue Iranian dealings. In October 2006, the top official for business in the Americas, whom the regulator did not name, warned in a ""panicked message"" that the Iranian dealings could cause ""catastrophic reputational damage"" and ""serious criminal liability."" ####  ##### A top executive in London shot back: ""You f---ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians."" The reply showed ""obvious contempt for U.S. banking regulations,"" the regulator said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Standard Chartered is the third British bank to be ensnared in U.S. law enforcement probes this summer. Barclays P.L.C. agreed to pay $453 million to settle U.S. and U.K. probes that it rigged a global lending benchmark in June. A month later, a U.S. Senate panel issued a scathing report that criticized HSBC Holding P.L.C.'s efforts to police suspect transactions, including Mexican drug traffickers. ####  ##### In a statement, Standard Chartered said the bank ""does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts."" ####  ##### It said it shared with U.S. agencies an analysis that demonstrated it ""acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply"" with U.S. regulations. Standard Chartered put the total value of Iran-related transactions that did not follow regulations at less than $14 million. ####  ##### ""The group was therefore surprised to receive the order from the DFS, given that discussions with the agencies were ongoing,"" Standard Chartered said. ""We intend to discuss these matters with the DFS and to contest their position."" ####  ##### The DFS declined further comment. The Representative Office of Iran in Washington was not immediately available to comment. The Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. economic and trade sanctions against targeted countries, declined to comment. ####  ##### Standard Chartered, a financier in emerging markets, is the sixth foreign bank since 2008 to be implicated in dealings with sanctioned countries such as Iran in investigations led by federal and New York law enforcement officials. ####  ##### Four banks—Barclays, Lloyds, Credit Suisse Group and ING Bank—have agreed to fines and settlements totaling $1.8 billion. HSBC currently is under investigation by U.S. law enforcement, according to bank regulatory filings. ####  ##### The New York regulator, headed by former prosecutor Benjamin Lawsky, ordered Standard Chartered to explain why the bank should not lose its state license and the ability to process dollar transactions. Mr. Lawsky also ordered the bank to bring in an outside consultant to monitor its transactions. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### ""Standard Chartered Bank operated as a rogue institution,"" Mr. Lawsky said in the order. ####  ##### In an unusual move, the regulator also found fault with an outside consultant—Deloitte L.L.P.—because the firm ""apparently aided"" the bank in its deception. ####  ##### A report by Deloitte ""intentionally omitted critical information"" when submitted to regulators, it said. ####  ##### Deloitte was hired to conduct a review after Standard Chartered in 2004 was ordered by New York and federal regulators to correct anti-money laundering lapses. ####  ##### The so-called ""look back"" review was supposed to identify suspicious transactions between 2002 and 2004. But at one point, Standard Chartered asked Deloitte to ""delete"" references to certain improper Iranian transactions, according to the New York order. ####  ##### In a subsequent email, a Deloitte partner said the firm had ""agreed"" to the request because it was ""too politically sensitive for both (Standard Chartered) and Deloitte. That is why I drafted the watered-down version."" In 2007, that report enabled Standard Chartered to show regulators it had corrected flaws in its anti-money laundering systems. ####  ##### In a statement on Monday, Deloitte said its financial advisory service division ""performed its role as independent consultant properly and had no knowledge of any alleged misconduct by bank employees. Allegations otherwise are unsupported by the facts."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky's investigation is extraordinary because probes into how banks carried out transactions tied to Iran primarily have been led by the district attorney's office in Manhattan and the U.S. Justice Department. ####  ##### His probe is another sign that the regulator intends to join the New York attorney general and Manhattan district attorney in being a top financial watchdog. The DFS was created last October, effectively assuming oversight of two former banking and insurance regulatory agencies that were abolished. ####  ##### Probes by the Manhattan district attorney and U.S. Justice Department date to 2006 and have targeted some nine banks. Barclays agreed to pay $298 million in 2010 after admitting it processed payments for clients tied to Cuba, Sudan and other countries. Lloyds and Credit Suisse agreed to pay settlements of $350 million and $536 million. ####  ##### In June, ING agreed to pay $619 million to settle allegations that it, too, violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran and other countries. It was the biggest fine levied against a bank for sanctions violations. ####  ##### The Justice Department, working with the FBI in New York, is also investigating Standard Chartered's activities for violations of U.S. sanctions. ####  ##### Standard Chartered, founded in 1853, is headquartered in London, but specializes in financing in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky said Standard Chartered moved money through its New York branch on behalf of Iranian financial clients, including the Central Bank of Iran and state-owned Bank Saderat and Bank Melli, that were subject to U.S. sanctions. ####  ##### Monday's order alleged that Standard Chartered removed codes on money transfers and altered message fields, inserting phrases such as ""NO NAME GIVEN"" to hide the nature of the transactions. ####  ##### At the center of concern were alleged ""U-Turn"" transactions, involving money moved for Iranian clients among banks in Britain and the Middle East and cleared through Standard Chartered's New York branch, but which “neither started nor ended in Institution,"" Mr. Lawsky said in the order. ####  ##### Mr. Lawsky's investigation is unusual because probes into banks' transactions tied to Iran have been primarily led by the district attorney's office in Manhattan and the U.S. Justice Department. #### "
"Marine insurance market conditions favorable despite losses: Marsh";"Risk Management";"Marsh & McLennan";" ##### Buyers of marine insurance experience favorable market conditions despite natural catastrophes and other significant losses, according to a Marsh Inc. report. ####  ##### Plentiful underwriting surpluses for marine risks and increased insurer competition have kept insurers from seeking premium increases, the New York-based brokerage said Monday in the report. ####  ##### A succession of natural catastrophes, including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the Thailand floods, among others, resulted in significant marine cargo claims, the New York-based brokerage said Monday in the report. ####  ##### In addition, the Costa Concordia shipwreck in January resulted in the largest claim for a single ship at $1 billion split between hull and liability underwriters, Marsh said. ####  ##### “Despite some significant losses in the market, competition remains strong and there currently is no expectation that the availability of marine insurance will decline in the near future,” said Marcus Baker, chairman of Marsh’s marine practice, in a statement accompanying the report. “Insurance buyers that can demonstrate that they have strong risk management practices in place may continue to secure rate reductions at the time they renew their insurance policies, though not to the same degree that they have in recent years.” ####  ##### Piracy still remains an area of risk for the marine industry, with the vast majority of ships now armed, the broker said. Claims resulting from piracy can be quite large, as pirates have become better organized and the cargo on a captured ship can easily exceed the value of the ship. ####  ##### Marsh’s full report is available here. #### "
"Europeans shun risky investment for safe life insurance";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Allianz, France, Germany";" ##### LONDON (Reuters)—Europe's two biggest insurers, Allianz S.E. and AXA S.A., beat profit forecasts on Friday as customers, weary of years of financial market volatility, shunned risky investments for the comparative safety of traditional life insurance. ####  ##### Allianz, Europe's No.1 insurer, made an operating profit of €2.37 billion ($2.91 billion) in the second quarter, up 2.8% on a year ago, and ahead of the €2.2 billion ($2.71 billion) penciled in by analysts, it said on Friday. ####  ##### Second-ranked AXA also beat forecasts with net income of €2.6 billion ($3.20 billion) in the first six months of the year, outstripping the €2.11 billion ($2.60 billion) expected by analysts. ####  ##### Both companies benefited from resilient sales of traditional life insurance contracts which carry little or no investment risk, in contrast to products such as unit-linked policies where customer returns depend entirely on market performance. ####  ##### ""The customer assumes correctly that Allianz is more stable than his own government,"" Allianz finance chief Oliver Baete told reporters on a conference call. ####  ##### Shares in Allianz and AXA were up 3.2% and 3.4% respectively by 1038 GMT, outperforming a 2.75% increase in the Stoxx 600 European insurance share index ####  ##### ""All the big companies have been trying to push the plain-vanilla products,"" said a London-based analyst who asked not to be named. ####  ##### ""When people are nervous about the economy, health insurance is probably an easier sell than, say, pensions."" ####  ##### European equity markets have fallen steeply in volatile trade since the onset of the credit crunch in 2007, with the subsequent eurozone sovereign debt crisis adding to the turmoil. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Sales of traditional life products at Allianz rose 3.5% to €5.8 billion ($7.15 billion) in the second quarter, while premiums from riskier investment-focused policies fell 4.2% to €7.1 billion ($8.75 billion). ####  ##### The German insurer said sales had been strong in critically indebted Spain and Italy, which have suffered credit rating downgrades amid austerity measures designed to shore up membership of the eurozone. ####  ##### France's AXA said its life insurance arm benefited from a 5% jump in sales of traditional health and protection policies, while savings products were down 6% and unit-linked premiums fell 3%. ####  ##### AXA's overall life insurance profit rose 3%, lagging a 4% increase at its property/casualty division thanks to rising prices in several European markets. ####  ##### ""We have a strong trend in our protection and P&C markets, but its tougher in savings because of the economic situation,"" AXA finance chief Gerald Harlin told reporters. ####  ##### Allianz's life insurance operating profit jumped 20% in the second quarter, outweighing a 16% decline at its property and casualty insurance unit as claims from heavy flooding in Thailand last year escalated. #### "
"Court upholds FMLA retaliation award for employee";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### ST. LOUIS—An appellate court upheld a Family and Medical Leave Act retaliation award Tuesday, where the employer had terminated the worker shortly after she asked for the leave. ####  ##### According to the decision in Kathleen Marez vs. Saint-Gobain Containers Inc. by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, Ms. Marez took medical leave under the FMLA in July 2007 from the Muncie, Ind.-based firm. ####  ##### In January 2008, she told her supervisor she would require FMLA leave again for her husband's upcoming surgery. She was terminated two days later, with managers telling her it was because she had failed to follow company procedures. ####  ##### Ms. Marez sued, claiming retaliation in violation of the FMLA and gender discrimination. A jury returned a verdict in Ms. Marez' favor on the FMLA claim, but in Saint-Gobain's favor on the gender discrimination claim. ####  ##### On the FMLA claim, the jury awarded her $206,500 in damages and an another $206,500 in liquidated damages. The court also awarded her part of her requested attorneys' fees. Saint-Gobain appealed. ####  ##### Pointing out Ms. Marez's termination occurred less than 48 hours after the protected activity, the court said, “In considering whether temporal proximity alone can support an inference of causation, we have rarely been faced with two events so close in time.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The unanimous three-judge panel's ruling said, “Marez did not rely solely on the proximity of her termination to her notification to (her supervisor) that she would require FMLA leave. She presented evidence that one other production supervisor had committed the same error that she had, and other production supervisors had committed similar infractions, without being terminated or suffering other significant adverse consequences,” said the appellate court, in upholding the lower court. ####  ##### Commenting on the case, Jason Rossiter, an attorney with Zashin & Rich Co. L.P.A. in Cleveland, who was not involved in the case, said, “It's always a bit of danger to take some kind of an action against an employee who has done something that's protected.” ####  ##### In a situation like that, “you really need to get advice” from an attorney, who “can walk you through the process” to make sure you are not creating a wrong impression about what you are doing, Mr. Rossiter said. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Bogart, Burberry no longer 'entrenched' in lawsuit";"Risk Management";"";" ##### Humphrey Bogart’s heirs and the Burberry Group P.L.C. reportedly have ended a squabble over the use of the actor’s iconic trench coat in advertising. ####  ##### According to news reports, Burberry, which uses an image from the film “Casablanca” of the actor wearing one of its trench coats, has dropped a lawsuit it filed in Manhattan in May, in which it asked for a declaration that the use of Mr. Bogart’s name and photo did not infringe Bogart L.L.C.’s trademark. ####  ##### Bogart L.L.C., which is primarily owned by Mr. Bogart’s children, had responded to the lawsuit by filing a trademark-infringement suit in state court in California, claiming that Burberry “designed, manufactured and sold numerous apparel and accessory products” as well as created marketing materials making use of its intellectual property. ####  ##### They said the use of the actor’s photo gave the public the false impression of an endorsement of the company’s coats. ####  ##### The children’s lawsuit sought damages, including punitive damages, and an injunction to keep Burberry from suing Mr. Bogart’s name or image, and estimated one claim alone would be for at least $1 million, according to the reports. ####  ##### But despite the apparent settlement, it’s probably a fair bet that, to quote Casablanca’s closing line, neither party is saying to the other, “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" #### "
"Madoff trustee seeks to block $410M Merkin accord";"Risk Management";"";" ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—The trustee seeking money for victims of Bernard Madoff is trying to block a $410 million settlement resolving New York's claims against a Wall Street hedge fund manager accused of secretly steering client money to the swindler. ####  ##### Irving Picard, the trustee, on Wednesday asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to block the settlement with the financier Ezra Merkin, saying it interferes with his exclusive right to seek money for victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. ####  ##### New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the Merkin accord June 24 after it had won approval from a New York state judge. It is one of the largest settlements with any individual over activities linked to Mr. Madoff and his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities L.L.C. ####  ##### Citizens of New York do not deserve ""a jump start over all of the victims of this heinous fraud,"" Mr. Picard said in a court filing. ""It is clear that the remaining assets of the Merkin defendants will be insufficient to satisfy the trustee's claims. Such an outcome would be extraordinarily prejudicial to the creditors of the BLMIS estate."" ####  ##### Mr. Picard has been seeking more than $500 million from Mr. Merkin and his funds. ####  ##### Mr. Schneiderman had accused Mr. Merkin of ""recklessly"" feeding $2.4 billion from investors in his funds to Mr. Madoff, while falsely claiming that he had been actively managing the money. ####  ##### Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman, called Mr. Merkin's request for an injunction to block the Merkin accord ""inappropriate and without legal merit, and we will take all necessary steps to oppose it."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Mr. Merkin, said ""we are disappointed by Mr. Picard's efforts to interfere"" with the earlier settlement, and that his client will continue to defend against what he called Mr. Picard's ""meritless allegations."" ####  ##### Mr. Picard has largely been successful in stopping Madoff victims and people acting on their behalf from pursuing their own cases, though some litigation is still pending. ####  ##### Last month, he agreed to mediation for a dispute over a $270 million lawsuit by California Attorney General Kamala Harris against the widow of Beverly Hills money manager Stanley Chais over Mr. Chais' dealings with Mr. Madoff. ####  ##### The lawsuit against Mr. Schneiderman also names as defendants Mr. Merkin, his firm Gabriel Capital Corp., and receivers for his four private funds that invested with Madoff: Ariel Fund Ltd., Ascot Fund Ltd., Ascot Partners L.P. and Gabriel Capital L.P. ####  ##### Bart Schwartz, the receiver for the Ariel and Gabriel funds, said he will oppose any attempt to derail their ""fair, legal and binding"" settlement with Mr. Schneiderman. The receiver for the Ascot funds was not immediately available for comment. ####  ##### Mr. Picard also demanded that Mr. Schneiderman provide a copy of the Merkin settlement, saying the attorney general's lawyers have refused because it was ""premature"" to do so. ####  ##### Mr. Schneiderman's settlement with Mr. Merkin had been delayed for more than four months while parties tried to address Mr. Picard's claims in a comprehensive resolution, a person familiar with the matter said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The person declined to be named because the negotiations were not public. A spokeswoman for Mr. Picard declined to comment. ####  ##### More than $1.1 billion has been distributed to Madoff victims. Last week, Mr. Picard asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who oversees the Madoff firm's liquidation, for permission to distribute as much as $2.4 billion more. ####  ##### Mr. Picard has recovered about $9.14 billion for victims so far, though much has been tied up in litigation. The trustee has estimated that Madoff victims lost about $20 billion. ####  ##### Separately, the trustee's law firm of Baker & Hostetler L.L.P. on Wednesday asked Judge Lifland for approval to bill $48.1 million of legal fees to pursue the Madoff cases for the four months ended Jan. 31, boosting total fees charged to about $321.2 million. ####  ##### The sum for the four months represents 134,431 hours of work at an average of $357.86 per hour, after a 10% discount, according to a court filing. ####  ##### Mr. Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison. #### "
"Court rules Buffalo firefighter exams not discriminatory";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### NEW YORK—The city of Buffalo, N.Y., did not discriminate against African-Americans in a test it used to promote firefighters, said a divided federal appellate court panel Friday. ####  ##### The Men of Color Helping All Society Inc. had filed suit against the city, its fire department, and the fire department's commissioner and deputy commissioner based on 1998 and 2002 firefighter promotion exams that derived from a common statewide job analysis, according to the ruling in M.O.C.H.A. Society Inc. vs. City of Buffalo by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. ####  ##### In the 1998 test, the 179 white firefighters who took the test had a 74.3% pass rate, while the 89 black firefighters had only a 42.6% pass rate. There was a “significant disparity” in the 2002 test results as well, according to the ruling. ####  ##### The group charged the defendants with race discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ####  ##### A district court found Buffalo had successfully demonstrated the test was job related and consistent with business despite the 1998 exam. It also awarded defendants summary judgment on the disparate treatment challenge to the 1998 test. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The appellate panel agreed with the district court in its 2-1 ruling. The district court heard extensive evidence as to how an independent state agency had determined, based on evidence drawn from fire departments across New York and the nation, that the job of fire lieutenant “involves common tasks requiring essentially the same skills, knowledge, abilities and personal characteristics” and “developed a general test based on those findings,” said the ruling. ####  ##### “The district court had sufficient evidence to make a preponderance finding that Buffalo's use of that test to promote fire fighters to the rank of fire lieutenant was job related and consistent with business necessity,” it said, in affirming the lower court's decisions. ####  ##### Previous cases ####  ##### Last year, the city of Chicago < a href=""/article/20110819/NEWS07/110819805"" target=""_blank"">paid $47 million to settle a lawsuit brought by black firefighters who alleged a 1995 test was discriminatory. ####  ##### In June 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court in  Frank Ricci et al. vs. John DeStefano et al. ruled in favor of 17 firefighters who sued New Haven, Conn. The city rejected the 2003 captain and lieutenant's promotion exams out of fear it would be sued for discrimination by minority candidates. #### "

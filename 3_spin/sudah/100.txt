"U.S. Chamber looks to fix, not repeal, Obamacare";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accepted that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is here to stay and, rather than continue calling for its complete repeal, will work this year to change what it sees as flaws in the 2010 law, the business group's president and CEO said Wednesday. ####  ##### Outlining the chamber's 2014 priorities, Thomas Donohue, the group's president and CEO, sounded realistic about the statute that his organization had once wanted Congress to repeal and that Mr. Donohue said posed the single greatest threat to the future of American enterprise. ####  ##### “The administration is obviously committed to keeping the law in place, so the chamber has been working pragmatically to fix those parts of Obamacare that can be fixed — while doing everything we can to make regulations and mandates as manageable as possible for businesses,” Mr. Donohue said in his annual State of American Business address in Washington. “In 2014, we will work to repeal onerous health care taxes; repeal, delay or change the employer mandate; and give companies and their employees more flexibility in the choice of health insurance plans.” ####  ##### Mr. Donohue also highlighted the need for entitlement reform, as he has in this address in previous years. In 10 years, he noted, the cost for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will reach $3 trillion a year, while the share of the budget to pay for those programs — plus interest on the debt — will expand to 76% in 2023 from 65% last year. ####  ##### “Demographics are destiny and there's no way around it,” Mr. Donohue said. “Americans are living longer. Each and every day another 10,000 baby boomers retire — and that will add up to 77 million new retirees over the next 17 years.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In a news conference after his remarks, Mr. Donohue said he believes entitlement reform will not happen for a few more years. ####  ##### Katie Mahoney, executive director of health policy at the chamber, told Modern Healthcare that the chamber would like to see the Affordable Care Act's health insurance tax and medical device tax repealed, and it also will explore how the law's transitional reinsurance fee might be financed in a different way. ####  ##### Ms. Mahoney also said the chamber — which represents the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes in all sectors — would also like Congress to repeal the ACA's already-delayed employer mandate. But she acknowledged that in the current political environment, the chamber will take a pragmatic approach and will work to modify the mandate in a way that provides more certainty to businesses. ####  ##### “Under the statute, applicable large employers — those with 50 or more full-time equivalents — have to offer affordable minimum value coverage to full-time employees, full-time employees being those that work 30 hours or more hours a week,” Ms. Mahoney said. “Historically, full time has been defined as 40 hours a week, and we would like to see that definition be restored.” ####  ##### Another change would be to simplify the calculation that businesses must complete to determine if they are an applicable large employer. As Ms. Mahoney explained, that term is defined as an organization with 50 or more full-time employees, but how to determine that figure — which takes into account part-time hours, for instance — is often confusing for small businesses. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Ms. Mahoney echoed Mr. Donohue's approach to the law and offered the reasons why the chamber has laid to rest its efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. ####  ##### “The landscape's very different,” Ms. Mahoney said. “We've been through the Supreme Court decision, we've been through another election, and the president is going to be in office for another three years and this is his signature domestic policy,” she added. “So I think to say otherwise would be irrational.” ####  ##### Jessica Zigmond writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Corporate pension funding status rises to highest level since 2007";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management";" ##### The average funding ratio for the 100 largest U.S. corporate defined benefit plans jumped to 93.5% in 2013 — more than 10 percentage points higher than the previous two years and the highest since 2007, according to Pensions & Investments' annual analysis of corporate SEC filings. ####  ##### “I would not be surprised if the funding ratio exceeded 100% by the end of this year,” said Andrew Wozniak, the New York-based head of fiduciary solutions, in the investment strategy and solutions group of BNY Mellon Investment Management. ####  ##### The funding level was 108.6% in 2007, but plunged to 79.1% in 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. In 2012, funding was 80.6%, a slight decrease from 2011's 81.6%. ####  ##### The aggregate funding deficit of the largest 100 plans shrank to $122.3 billion in 2013, from a deficit of $301.6 billion in 2012. ####  ##### “We were pleased to see a rise in funded status in 2013,” said Alan Glickstein, Dallas-based senior retirement consultant at Towers Watson & Co. However, Mr. Glickstein noted the relatively high discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities in 2013 were “still well below where rates were before the financial crisis.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The average discount rate rose to 4.82% in 2013 — higher than the 4.05% for 2012 but lower than the average of 6.4% used in 2008. ####  ##### “For years, people have expected rates to rise,” said Justin Owens, asset allocation strategist at Russell Investments in Seattle. “2013 was the year when interest rates finally rose.” ####  ##### Strong performance in equity markets also played a big part in the 2013 increase. The Russell 3000 index gained 33.6% in 2013, while the Standard & Poor's 500 returned 32.4%. International equities also showed higher returns in 2013, with the MSCI World index ex-U.S. returning 21.6%. ####  ##### Fixed income did not fare as well. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate index returned -2% in 2013, while the Barclays Global Aggregate ex-U.S. index returned -3.1%. ####  ##### The lower fixed-income returns in 2013 are not expected to cause a change in asset allocation strategies. “You just care about the stability of your plan's funding,” said Towers Watson's Mr. Glickstein. “Looking at it in the context of liability-driven (investing) or liability matching, you are less concerned with beating the market and more concerned with smoothing out volatility.” ####  ##### Aggregate assets of the top 100 plans increased to $1.16 trillion in 2013, a $53.9 billion increase from the previous year. ####  ##### “2013 was a fantastic year for plan sponsors of corporate defined benefit plans,” said BNY Mellon's Mr. Wozniak. “A strong equity market is the other half of the story.” ####  ##### In an environment of higher interest rates, lower plan liabilities and higher equity returns, 97 plans increased their funded status in 2013, while 24 plans had a funding surplus, four more than in the previous year. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The Allstate Corp., Northbrook, Ill., with $5.6 billion in defined benefit assets, had the highest jump in funded status, rising to a funding ratio of 105.8% in 2013 from 80.2% in 2012. In addition to a higher discount rate and a more favorable equity market, the company's 10-K filing also cited a $479 million increase in the pension prior service credit during 2013, which resulted from changes to the plan's benefit formula. ####  ##### The highest funding ratio — 163.8% — once again was held by NextEra Energy Inc., Juno Beach, Fla., with $3.69 billion in assets and $2.25 billion in liabilities. In 2012, Next-Era Energy's funding ratio was 142.7%. According to notes in the company's 10-K filing, NextEra Energy works to maintain its plan's funded status to minimize future company contributions. ####  ##### Mr. Wozniak of BNY Mellon sees maintaining a balance between assets and projected liabilities as a forward-looking strategy for corporate plan sponsors. “They would rather have the surplus cover that,” he said, “so they won't have to write a check in the future.” ####  ##### MeadWestvaco Corp., Richmond, Va., had the next highest funding ratio at 161.2%, up from 141.4% in 2012. The company used a 2013 discount rate of 4.82%, reducing liabilities to $2.4 billion from $3.03 billion the previous year. The company had defined benefit assets of $3.9 billion in 2013. ####  ##### The remaining three of the top five highest-funded plans were financial services companies. BB&T Corp., Winston-Salem, N.C., had a funding ratio of 153.2%, with $3.73 billion in assets and $2.43 billion in liabilities. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., New York had a funding ratio of 133.2%, with $14.35 billion in assets and $10.78 billion in liabilities, and Bank of America Corp., New York, had $18.28 billion in assets, $14.15 billion in liabilities and a funding ratio of 129.2%. ####  ##### Bank of America also had the second-highest increase in funded status, with a 25.2 percentage-point increase from 2012. Bank of America froze its defined benefit plans effective June 30, 2012, and the company's 10-K filing cited remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities after the freeze as a contributing factor to the funded status increase. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Sponsors will continue to shed liabilities — adding a lump sum, cashing out, fully or partially terminating the plan,” said Mr. Wozniak of BNY Mellon. ####  ##### When categorized by sector, financials had the highest average funding ratio — 107.1% — in 2013, with 14 companies in the sector. Next was health care, with an average funding ratio of 97.6% for eight plans. ####  ##### The highest funding ratio in the health-care sector belonged to Merck & Co. Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J. With $17.4 billion in assets and $16.06 billion in liabilities, Merck had a 21.6 percentage-point increase in funded status, rising to 108.6% in 2013 from 87% in 2012. ####  ##### Two airlines found themselves at the other end of the funding spectrum. Delta Air Lines Inc., Atlanta, had the dubious honor of sponsoring the worst-funded plan of the top 100 for the ninth consecutive year. Delta had a funded ratio of 46.9%, with plan assets of $8.9 billion and liabilities of $19.1 billion. Delta contributed $914 million to its plans in 2013. In 2012, Delta had a funded ratio of 38.1%. ####  ##### American Airlines Inc., Fort Worth, Texas, was third lowest on the list, with $10.06 billion in assets and $14.9 billion in liabilities for a funding ratio of 67.5% in 2013. American Airlines increased contributions to $494 million in 2013, which contributed to a $996 million reduction in plan liabilities. ####  ##### Decreased contributions were a noticeable trend among the top 100 companies in 2013, with contributions at the lowest level since the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. “We expect to see lower contributions,” said Bob Collie, chief research strategist, Americas institutional, at Russell Investments, Seattle. “It's interesting to look at the impact of funded status on contributions.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Although some companies made voluntary contributions above requirements, many followed a policy of contributing the minimum amount to gain tax advantages and comply with regulatory requirements. “In aggregate, this sample of very large plans is pulling back on contributions,” said Mr. Glickstein. ####  ##### The plans in P&I's universe made contributions of $31.7 billion in 2013, down from $47.4 billion in 2012. Five companies contributed $1 billion or more in 2013. ####  ##### Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., was the top contributor, putting $3.54 billion into its plans in 2013. With $41.22 billion in assets and $43.18 billion in liabilities, Ford's 2013 funded status was 95.4%. Ford reduced its liabilities by offering some participants a one-time choice to receive a lump-sum benefit settlement. According to its 10-K, Ford settled obligations of $3 billion in 2013 through the lump-sum offers, an option more plans might pursue as funding ratios rise. ####  ##### “The funding level has improved,” said Mark Ruloff, director of asset allocation at Towers Watson in Arlington, Va. “They are definitely more inclined to derisk, whether through an investment strategy move or a buyout.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Lockheed Martin Corp., Bethesda, Md., contributed $2.25 billion in 2013 to place second on the contribution list. The company had $33.01 billion in assets and $42.16 billion in liabilities in 2013 for a 78.3% funding ratio, 11.1 percentage points higher than in 2012. ####  ##### Boeing Co., Chicago, contributed $1.54 billion in 2013, reaching a funded status of 84.7%. Boeing had $58.13 billion in assets and $68.63 billion in liabilities. Boeing contributed more than $1.5 billion in 2013 but expects required contributions to be minimal in 2014. According its 10-K filing, the company plans discretionary contributions of about $750 million. ####  ##### Raytheon Co., Waltham, Mass., contributed $1.08 billion, with a funded status of 84.9%, $18.82 billion in assets and $22.16 billion in liabilities in 2013. With a funding ratio of 80.3%, a 19.6 percentage point increase from 60.7% in the previous year, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio, made $1.02 billion in contributions in 2013. ####  ##### The top 100 companies have announced contribution plans of $21.09 billion so far for 2014. According to annual filings, Ford, Exxon Mobil Corp., Goodyear Tire & Rubber, Verizon Communications Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp. expect to make contributions of more than $1 billion each. ####  ##### The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, which reduced required minimum contributions, will continue to have an impact in 2014. “It's still relevant,” said Mr. Wozniak. “Sponsors still have an option to defer some of the funding to future years. It gives them more flexibility.” ####  ##### Trilbe Wynne writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Employers join forces to oppose new PBGC premium hikes";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits";" ##### New hikes in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. premiums will have a negative economic impact, resulting in job losses and less money for business investment, according to a letter signed by dozens of employers and sent to federal lawmakers Tuesday. ####  ##### “Every additional dollar that employers must pay to the PBGC is one dollar less that can be used to fund participant benefits, expand their businesses, create jobs and grow the economy,” according to the letter signed by members of the Pension Coalition, a group of more than 100 employers, trade associations and professional organizations. ####  ##### “Increased costs associated with our pension program also means less flexibility for us to make investments that strengthen the competitiveness of our company and have a positive economic impact,” Etta Strong, director of compensation and benefits at Owens-Illinois Inc. in Perrysburg, Ohio, said in a statement. Owens-Illinois is a member of the Pension Coalition. ####  ##### The groups' letter comes amid worries by some business trade groups that federal lawmakers might attach a PBGC premium hike measure — or an administration proposal to transfer from Congress to the PBGC authority to set premium levels — to a broader bill. ####  ##### Congress last boosted PBGC premiums in December as part of a broader federal budget agreement. The PBGC flat-rate premium, which is paid by all defined benefit plan sponsors, will rise in 2015 to $57 per plan participant and to $64 in 2016. The premium now is $49 per plan participant. ####  ##### In addition, the variable-rate premium, which is paid by employers with underfunded plans, will increase to $24 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2015, up from $14 this year, and to $29 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2016. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### PBGC executives say the current premium system has to be changed. “We agree that PBGC premiums need to be reformed,” said PBGC Director Josh Gotbaum in a statement Wednesday. ####  ##### “It's important to understand that this administration and the previous one supported premium reforms. The President's proposal would allow PBGC's Board to both raise and lower premiums in a way that is fair, affordable, and preserves pensions,” he said. #### "
"Accenture puts private exchange enrollment at 3 million";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Roughly 3 million individuals who obtain healthcare coverage through their employer enrolled through private exchanges for 2014 benefits, according to an analysis by consulting firm Accenture. ####  ##### That population is expected to swell to 40 million by 2018, or roughly a quarter of all individuals with employer-based coverage. ####  ##### Accenture's enrollment estimate for private exchanges in 2014 is far above previous calculations. In March, Moody's Investors Service Inc. estimated that fewer than 1 million active employees enrolled in coverage through a private exchange for 2014. And a forecast released last year by Accenture predicted that the private exchange population for this year would be 1 million individuals. ####  ##### Private exchanges mimic their public counterparts. They offer employees a wider array of coverage choices, often from competing insurers, than in traditional job-based benefit plans. The hope is that such marketplaces will reduce overall costs by allowing workers to choose plans that more accurately reflect their healthcare needs. Some of the largest private exchanges are operated by benefit management companies such as Aon Hewitt, Towers Watson & Co. and Mercer L.L.C. But many insurers have launched private exchange products as well. ####  ##### According to Richard Birhanzel, managing director of Accenture Health Administration Services, the 3 million figure was derived from scrutinizing reports by publicly traded companies and insights gleaned from working directly with insurers. Mr. Birhanzel attributes the rapid growth in enrollment in part to proselytizing efforts on the part of private exchange operators. But he also believes that there is organic interest from companies, particularly small to midsize employers. ####  ##### The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co. is one of the few large employers to embrace the private exchange model. Mr. Birhanzel argues that the 250,000-employee company's shift to a marketplace run by Aon Hewitt will encourage other large employers to make the change. “We haven't seen anybody else that's over 100,000 move yet, but we expect that that will happen this fall,” he said. ####  ##### Part of the allure for companies is that it allows them to shift from a defined benefit system to a defined contribution system. The change is similar to the transformation that's taken place with pensions in recent decades. It potentially allows companies to stabilize costs in an area that's been growing rapidly — premiums have gone up by 80% over the last decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation — but it also risks alienating employees if it merely shifts costs onto them. ####  ##### “Moving from defined benefit to defined contribution is a big part of this story,” Mr. Birhanzel said. “At a minimum they get to predictability.” ####  ##### The Accenture report also highlights risks that companies could face in adopting private exchanges. Most notably, they need to make sure employees have sufficient tools to make intelligent choices in the marketplace. Otherwise workers might end up with plans that don't meet their medical needs. ####  ##### Paul Demko writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Massachusetts repeals play-or-pay health care rules ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits";" ##### A Massachusetts health reform law board Thursday formally repealed regulations to a landmark state statute that required employers to either offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a fine. ####  ##### The unanimous vote by the board of directors of the Massachusetts Health Connector, which regulates key provisions of the state's 2006 health reform law, brings to a final end a provision in that law that required employers with at least 11 full-time employees to either offer coverage or pay an annual $295-per-employee fine. ####  ##### The catalyst for the board action was legislation Massachusetts lawmakers passed last year that formally repealed the mandate, known as the Employer Fair Share Contribution program. ####  ##### “Given the repeal of the underlying statutes, the Health Connector's accompanying regulations no longer have legal force. For these reasons, we are proposing to repeal the regulations to minimize any confusion about their legal effect,” stated a background paper prepared for Health Connector directors prior to the vote. ####  ##### Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick had sought repeal of the mandate, saying that it was no longer necessary to have such a requirement because of the subsequent passage of federal health care reform legislation. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and subsequent regulations, the federal employer mandate will go into effect in two stages. ####  ##### Next year, employers with at least 100 full-time employees will have to offer coverage to at least 70% of their full-time employees or pay an annual $2,000-per-employee penalty. In calculating the penalty, an employer can exclude 80 of its full-time employees in 2015. ####  ##### Then in 2016, the mandate will apply to employers with at least 50 full-time employees, with the 80-employee exclusion in calculating the penalty for not offering coverage permanently dropping to 30 employees. ####  ##### Aside from repealing the Fair Share contribution, the Massachusetts board also voted to repeal rules that required employers to provide access to so-called Section 125 plans to employees who work at least 64 hours a month. ####  ##### In a Section 125 plan, employees pay for health care premiums with pretax dollars. ####  ##### The requirement was intended to address situations in which employees not eligible for group coverage could use those pretax contributions to buy individual policies through Massachusetts' health insurance exchange. ####  ##### However, guidance issued in 2013 by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service made clear that the health care reform law, effective in 2014, bars employers from offering Section 125 plans to employees to purchase non-group health insurance without an employer contribution. ####  ##### In certain ways, the broader Massachusetts law was a model for the subsequent federal health care reform law, such as making state premium subsidies available to the lower-income uninsured to purchase coverage through a state health insurance exchange. ####  ##### Its 2006 law is a key reason Massachusetts has had over the last few years the lowest uninsured rate — 4.1%, in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau — of any U.S. state. #### "
"Lockheed to completely freeze pension plan by 2020";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. will completely freeze its defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees, completing a process it began in 2006. ####  ##### In the first step of a two-part plan, the amount of employees’ pay, used for pension benefit calculation purposes, will be frozen as of Jan. 1, 2016. ####  ##### Under the second step, employees’ credited service for pension benefit calculation purposes will be frozen as of Jan. 1, 2020. ####  ##### Affected employees, will, by 2020, receive an automatic company contribution equal to 6% of pay to a defined contribution plan. They also will be eligible for company matching contributions, up to 4% of pay. ####  ##### Lockheed’s actions follow an earlier step — effective in 2006 — in which new salaried employees no longer could participate in the defined benefit plan. ####  ##### Among other things, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed said in a statement that it was taking the action to better manage retirement plan costs at a more predictable rate and to limit long-term liabilities. ####  ##### Another factor, Lockheed said, was changing workforce demographics. “Since we closed the pension plan to new participants in 2006, we expect that by 2016, the majority of our employees will not be pension participants. Introducing a unified retirement program ensures that we’re offering consistent and competitive retirement benefits to the majority of Lockheed Martin salaried employees,” the company said ####  ##### About 48,000 of Lockheed Martin’s 113,000 employees participate in the pension plan. #### "
"U.S. appeals court rules for same-sex marriage in Oklahoma";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver has ruled in favor of same-sex couples seeking the right to legally marry in the state of Oklahoma. ####  ##### Echoing its previous decision to uphold a lower court's invalidation of Utah's constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in that state, a divided three-judge panel of 10th Circuit ruled 2-1 on Friday that a similar amendment to Oklahoma's constitution unfairly deprives gay and lesbian couples of marriage rights and benefits under state law. ####  ##### “Plaintiffs who wish to marry a partner of the same sex or have such marriages recognized seek to exercise a fundamental right, and state justifications for banning same-sex marriage that turn on the procreative potential of opposite-sex couples do not satisfy the narrow tailoring test applicable to laws that impinge upon fundamental liberties,” Judge Carlos Lucero wrote in the court's majority opinion, concluding that the state's ban violates gay and lesbian couples' rights to equal protection and due process under the U.S. Constitution. ####  ##### In addition to many of the same justifications for prohibiting same-sex marriage that the court previously rejected in the Utah case, Tulsa County Clerk Sally Howe Smith — the primary defendant in the lawsuit challenging Oklahoma's ban — argued that legalizing same-sex marriage would undermine the state's efforts to protect children by reducing the likelihood of their being raised by their biological parents. ####  ##### “Oklahoma has enacted numerous laws that result in children being raised by individuals other than their biological parents, and Oklahoma permits infertile opposite-sex couples to marry despite the fact that they, as much as same-sex couples, might raise non-biological children,” Judge Lucero said. “Yet Ms. Smith does not explain why same-sex marriage poses a unique threat such that it must be treated differently from these other circumstances.” ####  ##### “In summary, none of the arguments presented by Ms. Smith that were unaddressed in (the Utah case) persuade us to veer from our core holding that states may not, consistent with the United States Constitution, prohibit same-sex marriages,” Judge Lucero said. ####  ##### Thus far, the 10th Circuit is the only federal appeals court to rule on the legality of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage since the U.S. Supreme Court's June 2013 ruling in U.S. v. Windsor, which invalidated provisions of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage for federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman. ####  ##### Since the Supreme Court's ruling, state and federal judges in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky and Florida have struck down those states' bans on same-sex marriage in their entirety, while bans in Ohio and Tennessee have been partially overturned. ####  ##### Appeals to U.S. District Court rulings in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage in Virginia, Texas, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Nevada and Idaho are currently pending in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 9th circuits. #### "

The company said it does not expect to have to make additional contributions to its pension plans as result of the offer. ####  ##### In 2013, the company's pension plans were significantly underfunded, with more than $3.5 billion in assets and $4.5 billion in liabilities. ####  ##### When pension plan participants take lump-sum benefits and are no longer covered by the plan, their former employers do not have to worry about how interest rate fluctuations and investment results could affect how much they will have to contribute to their pension plans to fund future annuity payments. ####  ##### In addition, when participants take lump sums and move out of a pension plan, employers can reduce certain fixed costs, such as the payment of sharply rising premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. #### "
"WellPoint medical cost ratio drives second-quarter profit beat";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, P/C Insurers, Wellpoint, Financial Results";" ##### (Reuters) — U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc. on Wednesday reported a decline in second-quarter profit, but its closely watched medical costs as a percentage of premiums ratio improved and it beat Wall Street estimates. ####  ##### WellPoint, which runs Anthem and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, is the third large health insurer to beat analysts' earnings estimates for the quarter, but shares have sold off as investors worried that a run in low medical costs might be ending. ####  ##### WellPoint beat Wall Street expectations because this ratio was less than foreseen, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note. ####  ##### ""The quarter should offer relief to nervous investors,"" Ms. Gupte said. ####  ##### WellPoint said it spent 82.7% of the premiums that it brought in on medical claims in what is known as the medical benefit expense ratio. That is down from 83.9% a year earlier. ####  ##### WellPoint said net income fell to $731 million, or $2.56 per share, from $800 million, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier. ####  ##### Excluding gains, it reported earnings of $2.44 per share. Analysts had been expecting $2.26. ####  ##### The decline in net income is partly due to a rise in sales, general and administrative expenses to 15.8% of operating revenue from 13.9% a year earlier because of new fees and continued spending due to health care reform. ####  ##### It raised its expectations for 2014 earnings by 20 cents to at least $8.60 per share. #### "

That would reduce its pension plan obligations by between $170 million and $340 million and its plan underfunding by between $13 million and $26 million, ADM said in the SEC filing. ####  ##### The latest offer is the second one ADM has made in recent years to cut its pension costs. In 2012, ADM offered the opportunity to convert future annuities to a lump-sum benefit to between 7,000 and 7,500 vested former employees. ####  ##### In its 2013 10-K report, ADM said it paid about $134 million in lump-sum payments to those accepting the 2012 offer, cutting its pension benefit obligations by $174 million and reducing plan underfunding by about $40 million. ####  ##### As of June 30, ADM's U.S. pension plans were underfunded by about $350 million, with assets of $1.65 billion and liabilities of $2.03 billion, an ADM spokeswoman said. ####  ##### When pension plan participants take lump-sum benefits and are no longer covered by the plan, their former employers do not have to worry about how interest rate fluctuations and investment results could affect how much they will have to contribute to their pension plans to fund future annuity payments. ####  ##### In addition, when participants take lump sums and move out of the pension plan, employers can reduce certain fixed costs, such as the payment of sharply rising premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. #### "
"West Palm Beach, Fla., contractors must offer domestic partner benefits";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits";" ##### City commissioners in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday unanimously approved an ordinance requiring private companies that contract with the city to provide equal benefits for domestic partners. ####  ##### Effective Aug. 29, companies with at least five full-time employees bidding for city construction, supply or service contracts valued at $50,000 or more must offer benefits to employees' same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners equal to the spousal and dependent benefits they offer to legally married couples. ####  ##### Companies are exempt from the ordinance if they do not provide spousal or dependent benefits to their employees. Government entities and contracts for emergency services are also exempt from the law. ####  ##### West Palm Beach, a middle-class coastal city of approximately 102,000 residents located about 70 miles north of Miami, already offers spousal-equivalent benefits to its employees' domestic partners. The five-member commission said in the law's text that it believes the new requirement will encourage “contractors and businesses to maintain a competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining the highest quality work force, thereby improving the quality of goods and services that the city receives.” ####  ##### Florida is among the 31 states that does not recognize same-sex marriage. ####  ##### The city commissioners noted in the preamble to the ordinance that similar laws have been passed in other Florida cities and counties, including Broward County, Hallendale Beach, Key West, Miami Beach, Oakland Park and Wilton Manors. #### "

"Kodak bucks trend and enhances pension plan while eliminating 401(k) match";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### Employers are expected to examine Eastman Kodak Co.'s counter-trend move to sweeten its defined benefit pension plan and eliminate its 401(k) plan match, but benefits experts don't expect the move to lead a significant revival of traditional defined benefit plans. ####  ##### Bucking a long-standing trend of employers freezing their pension plans, Kodak disclosed last month that it will enrich its 14-year-old cash balance plan. Effective Jan. 1, 2015 plan participants will earn an annual benefit equal to 7% of pay, a big improvement over the current benefit formula in which plan participants earn an amount equal to 4% of pay. ####  ##### Kodak also will move employees remaining in its traditional final average pay pension plan to the cash balance plan. At the time Kodak set up the cash balance plan in 1999, employees were given the choice of remaining in it or shifting to the cash balance plan. ####  ##### On the other hand, starting next year, Kodak will stop making matching employee contributions to its 401(k) plan. Currently, Kodak fully matches employees' contributions up to 1% of pay, then matches 50% of employees' salary deferrals up to the next 4% of pay. That match has been available only to cash balance plan participants, and not to employees covered by the traditional pension plan. ####  ##### Kodak's upcoming enhancement of its cash balance plan flies in the face of the biggest retirement trend of the last decade: the freezing of defined benefit plans by thousands of employers, such as Bank of America Corp., International Business Machines Corp., and Wells Fargo & Co., with many of them simultaneously bolstering their 401(k) plans. ####  ##### That widespread move away from defined benefit plans largely has been driven by corporate worries about their cost volatility, with factors such as fluctuating interest rates and volatility of equity markets, which are out of employers' control, having a huge effect on plan contributions. ####  ##### Jeff Clarke, CEO of Eastman Kodak, said in a letter to employees that through this change in retirement plan design “our pension benefit will be competitive with companies in our industry.'' ####  ##### Separately, in a statement, Kodak said it designs its benefit plans to balance “affordability with the ability to attract and retain talent. We believe our changes to the U.S. pension plan strike this balance and are competitive with the market.'' ####  ##### Still, no one predicts that a large number of employers will follow in Kodak's path. “The single biggest reason not to take this approach is risk,” said Art Noonan, a senior vice president with Mercer L.L.C. in Pittsburgh. ####  ##### With a defined benefit pension plan, Mr. Noonan said, employers can face unexpectedly high costs, such as when a slump in the equities market sends the value of plan assets plummeting and, with that, forces employers to funnel more money into the plan at a time when employers may be least able to afford it. ####  ##### “The problem with defined benefit plans is cost volatility,'' said Byron Beebe, U.S. retirement market leader with Aon Hewitt in Cleveland. “Plan sponsors have moved away from them because of the lack of cost predictability.'' ####  ##### By contrast, costs are highly predictable and controllable with 401(k) plans, in which employers agree to contribute a fixed amount, typically a set percentage of employees' pay, to their retirement plan accounts. Ups and downs in the equities markets, interest rates fluctuations or changing life expectancies have no bearing on what employers must contribute. ####  ##### But now, experts say, there is new — albeit modest — employer interest in holding on to and improving their defined benefit plans. “There are good and intelligent reasons for employers'' to consider this approach, said Kevin Wagner, a senior retirement consultant with Towers Watson & Co. in Southfield, Michigan. ####  ##### One factor driving employer interest is potentially lower retirement benefits costs. For example, Kodak estimated in a presentation to investors and analysts that its pension plan redesign will achieve annual savings of $12 million. ####  ##### Experts say such savings are possible because employers may be able to provide the same benefit at less cost in a cash balance plan than in a 401(k) plan. ####  ##### That is because employers, utilizing professional investment advisers, will likely reap greater investment results than employees do when they invest their employers' 401(k) plan contributions on their own. “You may be able to provide bigger benefits at less cost,” said Jack Abraham, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### There are other investment-related factors that could drive employer interest in retaining defined benefit plans and perhaps reducing the generosity of their 401(k) plans. ####  ##### One factor is that employees may not contribute enough to their 401(k) plans to give them the income they need to retire, forcing them to keep working longer than either they or their employers would like. ####  ##### “That is a looming problem,” said Nancy Tartaro, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### “We are entering the time period where some employers are saying, 'My workforce is not retiring as we were thinking and therefore we may reconsider' ” the retirement plan approach, Mr. Noonan said. ####  ##### On the other hand, some employees whom employers especially value may rack up hefty returns through their defined contribution plan investments and “may retire earlier than their employers want,” Ms. Tartaro said. #### "
"Congress faces pressure to resolve multiemployer pension woes";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### When federal lawmakers passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974, they put aside a key issue affecting a big slice of the pension universe:  multiemployer plans. ####  ##### These 1,400 plans with about 10.4 million participants provide coverage to employees working for different companies and are members of trade unions. The plans are run by a joint board of union and employer representatives. When drafting ERISA, lawmakers punted on a crucial issue affecting employers contributing to the plans: What would be their financial obligations if they left underfunded plans? ####  ##### In 1980, Congress came up with the answer:  Employers leaving the plans would be liable for a share of the plans' unfunded liabilities.  That obligation — known as withdrawal liability — was a core part of a new law called the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act, which amended ERISA. ####  ##### Now, 34 years later, a movement is gaining traction in Congress to amend the multiemployer law, driven by fears that dozens of multiemployer pension plans may be in danger of collapse and guaranteeing the benefits to those plans' participants could itself swamp the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### Indeed, 175 multiemployer plans are in such financial trouble, the PBGC reported last year that it expects the plans to run out of assets and need money from the agency to pay participants' benefits. ####  ##### The agency has warned that the cost of paying the promised pensions would be nearly $10 billion, five times more than the federal agency has in its multiemployer pension plan insurance fund. Without changes in law and/or premium increases, the PBGC's insurance program “is more likely than not to run out of funds in eight years and highly likely to do so within 10 years,” the PBGC said in a summer report. ####  ##### A key part of many of the plans' problems is withdrawal liability, experts say. ####  ##### The amount of withdrawal liability can be so great that it has discouraged new employers from joining the multiemployer plans.  That, in turn, is creating a death spiral for plans as employer participants shrink when companies go out of business. ####  ##### “While many employers continue to withdraw from multiemployer plans, new employers have not been attracted to the plans to replace the leaving employers, mainly due to the unfavorable economics around the ultimate exit from the plan,” said Jack Abraham, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### “The path we are on will destroy the retirement security of families across the country,” U.S. Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said at a conference in June. ####  ##### But whether lawmakers will act anytime soon remains to be seen. #### "
"Landmark ERISA pension reform law sees mixed results 40 years after implementation";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Forty years after President Gerald Ford signed the first comprehensive pension reform bill into law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act has produced successes and failures. ####  ##### The impetus for the legislation President Ford signed on Labor Day 1974 came from the collapse of South Bend, Indiana-based Studebaker-Packard Corp. and the 1964 termination of its hourly pension plan covering members of the United Auto Workers union. ####  ##### When it was terminated, the plan only had enough assets to pay the 4,500 active vested participants about 15 cents for every dollar in pension benefits they had earned. ####  ##### The automaker's collapse was the start of a nationwide push to get pension reform through Congress, resulting in ERISA's first-time pension funding requirements, meaning companies could no longer promise benefits without putting any money aside to cover them. The law also created a federal pension insurance agency to provide additional protection for promised benefits. ####  ##### “Studebaker employees thought they had earned benefits, but they were not protected when the company failed,'' said Scott Macey, president of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington. “Today if you are promised a benefit, you are much more likely to get it. That is the overall success of ERISA.” ####  ##### Since then, thousands of underfunded pension plans have been terminated after their employer sponsors went out of business or were unable to make the required contributions. But ERISA's creation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. assured that billions of dollars in unfunded benefits are paid for participants in failed plans. In 2013, for example, the PBGC paid $5.4 billion in benefits to more than 800,000 retirees once enrolled in the nearly 4,600 plans the PBGC has taken over. ####  ##### “We cannot underestimate the good of the PBGC,” said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington. ####  ##### Besides protecting pension benefits, ERISA added security for employees' health care benefits. ####  ##### For example, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 that amended ERISA has been a boon to millions of employees and their dependents. It allows workers who lose their jobs to retain employer health care coverage for 18 months — and widowed, divorced or separated spouses for 36 months — by paying a premium equal to 102% of the employer group plan cost. ####  ##### That COBRA safety net especially showed its value during the Great Recession of 2008-2009 when federal lawmakers passed legislation providing a 65% federal subsidy of COBRA premiums for displaced employees. That subsidy resulted in a doubling to 38% of the COBRA takeup rate for laid-off employees, compared with the months just prior to before the subsidy was available, according to an Aon Hewitt survey. ####  ##### Meanwhile, ERISA helped put an end to “the disappointed expectations of private-sector workers covered by pension plans,” said Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington. Perhaps the most significant pension benefit protection under ERISA is a requirement that plan participants earn a nonforfeitable pension after a certain number of years. ####  ##### Before ERISA, as many as half of employer pension plans required at least 15 years of service to earn a benefit, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ERISA set several vesting schedules, including what became the most popular one in which participants became first and fully vested after 10 years of service. A later law, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, shortened the requirement to five years. ####  ##### The more rapid vesting has produced “clear economic value for tens of millions of workers,” said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. ####  ##### Indeed, ERISA and subsequent laws have solved the vesting issue so well that few today “even remember there was once a problem,” said Frank Cummings, a Washington pension attorney, who as a congressional staffer helped draft versions of the legislation that later became ERISA. ####  ##### However, ERISA has been ill-equipped to deal with the biggest recent pension problem: the erosion of defined benefit plans. ####  ##### As recently as 1998, 90% of Fortune 100 companies offered defined benefit plans to new salaried employees. Last year, just 30% did, according to Towers Watson & Co. And the decline in employer-sponsored defined benefit plans isn't limited to corporate giants. Last year, a little more than 23,000 employer plans were covered by the PBGC's insurance program, barely one-fifth of the plans covered in 1985. ####  ##### “Defined benefit plans are moribund. No one is starting a new plan,” while many existing plans are being frozen, Mr. Cummings said. ####  ##### Several reasons caused the fall of defined benefit plans, many of which have little to do with ERISA or later congressional initiatives, experts say. ####  ##### “With the younger generations, they recognized that their careers weren't going to be with one or two companies, but would likely be with 10 or 12,” said Joseph Molloy, vice president of managed care benefits and direct contracting at North Shore LIJ Health System in Great Neck, New York. ####  ##### Defined benefit plans, especially final average play plans in which benefits are tied to employees' salaries during their last years of service, appealed less to a more mobile workforce and employers. ####  ##### Cash balance plans became the fastest growing defined benefit plan of the late 1980s and early 1990, their popularity stemming from a more rapid benefit accrual and an easy-to-understand benefit formula. But numerous lawsuits challenged the basic design of cash balance plans as discriminatory against older employees. ####  ##### Many employers, tired of the regulatory and legal uncertainty, moved on to new approaches, often freezing defined benefit plans and enriching 401(k) plans. ####  ##### If passing the 2006 Pension Protection Act “had happened 15 years earlier, we would have had a much different outcome,” said Kevin Wagner, a senior Towers Watson & Co. retirement consultant in Southfield, Michigan. ####  ##### Although often thought of as a pension law, ERISA's legacy extends beyond pension plans. ####  ##### Indeed, a core ERISA provision — pre-emption of state laws that relate to employee benefit plans — has enabled employers operating in multiple states to offer health care plans with the same benefits to employees, regardless of the states those employees live. ####  ##### “You can have uniform benefits. This has made life so much easier for plan administrators,” said Marjorie Martin, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### “The challenge of complying with a jumble of multiple state health benefit mandate laws would have overwhelmed many employers,” said Amy Bergner, a managing director of human resources at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Washington. ####  ##### “Pre-emption is the crown jewel of ERISA,” said Mr. Klein of the American Benefits Council. ####  ##### To be sure, there have been legal challenges to ERISA pre-emption.  In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the legality of ERISA pre-emption. The justices, though, said that it applies only to self-insured plans and not to insured plans. ####  ##### Forty years after ERISA's passage, federal lawmakers do not have further changes to the statute under active consideration. ####  ##### Still, some lawmakers, as well as many in the private sector, say a 1980 law that amended ERISA to require employers leaving underfunded multiemployer plans to pay a share of the plans' promised, but unfunded benefits, needs to be revamped to prevent a collapse of a PBGC insurance program protecting participants' benefits. ####  ##### Another ERISA change employers say would be welcome would be to base, at least in part, PBGC employer premium rates on the financial health of plan sponsors. #### "
"Cincinnati to cover employee gender reassignment surgery";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Cincinnati will offer coverage for medically necessary transgender procedures under its employee health care plans beginning in 2015, according to city officials. ####  ##### Interim City Manager Scott Stiles last week authorized the city's group health insurer, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to add gender reassignment surgery to its scope of covered services under its active employee health plans, effective Jan. 1, 2015. ####  ##### Coverage for gender reassignment surgery will include a lifetime limit of $75,000 per covered individual.

Tom Marino, R-Pa., to express their frustration at the lack of developer-friendly online resources surrounding the privacy rules known as HIPAA. Apps such as AirStrip are particularly concerned about security and privacy, as they provide data to doctors to help them make urgent care decisions. ####  ##### In the letter viewed by Reuters, the developers said they are struggling to compete with larger vendors that have the resources to hire lawyers and consultants. They say they must rely on government websites, which have not been updated recently. ####  ##### Regulators ""have not kept pace with the rapid growth of technology that gives users greater access to healthcare providers and more control over their health information,"" the letter said. ####  ##### This complaint comes at a time developers, lobbyists and policymakers are engaged in heated discussions about how to oversee the growing mobile health market. Earlier on Monday, representatives from various government agencies addressed how to manage health data at the annual Consumer Health IT Summit. ####  ##### Morgan Reed, executive director of the App Association, a group that claims to represent 5,000 mobile app companies, said startups and large tech companies alike, including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, are seeking clarity on how sensitive health data can be stored and shared. ####  ##### The App Association was among those that signed the letter to Rep. Marino. Mr. Reed said some developers are relying on information that was last updated in 2006, months before the release of the iPhone and other mobile devices. ####  ##### Developers also asked that the government provide better guidance about how health data can be stored in the cloud. In the letter, they request that the government provide a developer-friendly list of frequently asked questions and other documentation, and that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services increase its participation in mobile health events. ####  ##### Rep. Marino said he previously asked developers in the startup community to provide a list of specific grievances with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ####  ##### ""A company should not be forced to staff up with a dozen lawyers simply to ensure they are in compliance with the law,"" he said. ""Rather, the burden should be on a transparent and responsive government to provide clarity and guidance, so companies can focus on growing their businesses and providing better and more innovative products and services to the public."" ####  ##### A spokesman for HHS said the agency has posted information online about security requirements for mobile health tools. ####  ##### ""The goal is to make sure that health information, no matter what form, paper or electronic, is kept safe and secure,"" he said. #### "
"Newell Rubbermaid to offer lump-sum pension benefits to 5,700 participants";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### Newell Rubbermaid Inc. will offer about 5,700 former vested employees not yet receiving pension benefits the opportunity to convert their future monthly annuity to a cash lump-sum benefit. ####  ##### “This will reduce the size of the company's U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation and related expenses,"" the Atlanta-based marketer of a wide range of consumer products, which include Paper Mate pens and Calphalon cookware, said in a filing Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### The cash payments made to those opting for lump sums will come from pension plan assets and will not affect corporate cash flow, the company said. ####  ##### At the end of last year, Newell Rubbermaid's U.S. pension plans were underfunded with $829.5 million in assets and $1.03 billion in liabilities, according to the company's 2013 10-K report. #### "

The plans have about 14,000 participants. ####  ##### When pension plan participants take lump-sum benefits and are no longer covered by the plan, their former employers do not have to worry about how interest rate fluctuations and investment results could affect how much they will have to contribute to their pension plans to fund future annuity payments. ####  ##### In addition, when participants take lump sums and move out of the pension plan, employers can reduce certain fixed costs, such as the payment of sharply rising premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. #### "
"Anthem, LA providers creating HMO to compete with Kaiser ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### An unusual joint venture between Anthem Blue Cross and seven competing Los Angeles-area hospital systems to offer employers a low-priced HMO plan underscores the eagerness of insurers and providers to try novel and risky strategies to survive in the rapidly changing healthcare marketplace. ####  ##### The new company — Anthem Blue Cross Vivity — will seek to replicate Kaiser Permanente's success in controlling costs and ensuring quality — but without the singular ownership Kaiser has over its insurance and provider arms. To do so, participants in the joint venture agreed to share equally in profits and losses. ####  ##### Starting next month, the venture will market a new health plan to employers with no deductible and premiums 10% below competitors, according to Anthem Blue Cross, a division of publicly traded insurer WellPoint. Patients who select the plan will be limited to a select network of providers, which includes 6,000 doctors and 14 hospitals. The California Public Employees' Retirement System has agreed to include the Vivity network in its HMO plan. ####  ##### Regional markets are seeing a wave of mergers, partnerships and creative arrangements like Vivity. These alliances are producing networks that compete head to head with each other and could transform markets along the lines envisioned by healthcare reform architects. The deals linking local competitors — such as the Vivity joint venture and a merger earlier this month in Chicago — are uniting historically separate sectors including hospitals, insurers, physician groups and post-acute care providers. ####  ##### Last week, St. Louis-based Ascension Health announced it would launch a post-acute care joint venture with a publicly traded partner. This month, Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University Health System said the two would merge to create a mega-system in Chicago. ####  ##### Deals have exploded under growing public and private pressure to control health spending growth, with resulting downward pressure on government and private insurance payment rates. Dealmakers say new combinations will reduce waste and lower cost while better coordinating care. But with the flurry of deals comes heightened antitrust concerns about reduced competition and resulting higher prices. ####  ##### On the other hand, the new combinations are designed to boost competition and lower prices in markets such as Los Angeles which traditionally featured relatively robust competition among major insurers but not providers. Vivity seeks to compete head-to-head with Kaiser — the Oakland-based integrated delivery system that holds the largest share of the California employer market — as well as Health Net and Blue Shield of California, which also offer HMO and other narrow-network products. ####  ##### “When it comes to healthcare cost control, if the market is going to solve our problems, it has to be through competing systems,” said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an architect of the healthcare reform law. The Vivity initiative indicates that healthcare prices have “reached the breaking point,” Gruber said. ####  ##### But hospital systems risk dangerously eroding margins in models that seek to reduce inpatient care, especially in a period where the fee-for-service payment model, which rewards greater volume, still holds powerful sway. ####  ##### Some dealmakers are betting that investment in care coordination and health IT can yield enough savings to make money under the new value-based payment models. But the evidence so far is mixed. The CMS said last week that three-quarters of roughly 200 Medicare accountable care organizations have failed to meet cost targets and earn bonuses through the first two years of the ACO demonstration. ####  ##### The new Vivity joint venture raises the stakes by betting that seven competing hospital systems — some of which are among the higher-cost systems in the market — can work jointly to reduce costs and improve quality. It will market an HMO to large, fully insured employers in Los Angeles and Orange counties, with an anticipated first-year enrollment of 15,000. It has said it will hold premiums 10% below current rates. Employers will pay a capitated payment for each enrollee. There will be no deductibles or coinsurance, and copayments for medical services will be modest. ####  ##### Vivity’s partners will pool premiums into one budget. Partners share equally in profits and losses. Partners that fail to meet quality targets won’t earn profits. ####  ##### Together with Anthem, Vivity’s provider partners — Cedars-Sinai Health System, Good Samaritan Hospital and UCLA Health, all in Los Angeles; Huntington Memorial Hospital, Pasadena; MemorialCare Health System, Fountain Valley; PIH Health, Whittier; and Torrance (Calif.) Memorial Medical Center — will move to meld their health IT systems, at first relying on Anthem’s claims data system. Anthem indicated it would expand the model to other markets and other states if it succeeds. ####  ##### Executives involved with the deal acknowledge the venture’s ambition and uncertainty. “The delivery systems themselves now have made a commitment and they’re trying to project where this will take them over time,” said Joseph Swedish, CEO of Anthem’s parent company, WellPoint. “But there are still, admittedly, many unknowns.” ####  ##### Vivity is among a wave of mergers and creative arrangements producing networks of historically independent players. These alliances could transform markets along the competitive lines envisioned by healthcare reform architects. ####  ##### “We’ve all done this before, we just haven’t done this together,” said Craig Leach, president and CEO of Torrance Memorial Health System. ####  ##### Vivity will offer CalPERS’ 210,000 members in Los Angeles and Orange counties access to health systems “that frankly, from a price perspective, would not have been available” without adding $100 per month to premiums otherwise, said Ann Boynton, deputy executive officer for benefit programs, policy and planning at CalPERS. ####  ##### Nonetheless, Vivity’s success likely will depend on targeting the high-cost care delivered in hospitals, something which can threaten hospital margins. Providers said existing capitation in California’s market has spurred many cost-saving transformations that prepare them to benefit under the Vivity HMO. ####  ##### “That is a pretty bold play,” said Leemore Dafny, former deputy director for healthcare and antitrust with the Federal Trade Commission and professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “It’s not obvious how they’re going to reduce hospital occupancy and come out on top.” ####  ##### Vivity executives said reduced spending will come through special negotiated rates for hospital care and efforts to more closely manage where patients get care. “Prices are irrelevant in this conversation,” said Stephen Ralph, CEO of Huntington Memorial Hospital. ####  ##### Thomas Priselac, CEO for the Cedars-Sinai Health System, and Dr. David Feinberg, president of UCLA Health, were unavailable for comment. ####  ##### Pam Kehaly, president of Anthem Blue Cross’ West Region, said Vivity partners will have many consolidation opportunities for reducing costs, such as operating a single nurse-call center for members. It also will be critical to direct patients to the most cost-effective setting across Vivity’s network of ambulatory-care centers, community hospitals and academic medical centers. ####  ##### That ability to manage across lower- and high-cost settings will be critical to academic centers’ success in this and other accountable care initiatives. “The idea is to provide the right care in the least restrictive setting,” said Dr. Scott Berkowitz, medical director of accountable care for Johns Hopkins Medicine and executive director of its ACO. ####  ##### But to manage that care, the partners will have to overcome many organizational and cultural differences. “There are seven different ways of doing things” among the systems involved, said Steve Valentine, president of the Camden Group, a Los Angeles consulting firm. ####  ##### Melanie Evans writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Honeywell latest firm to draw EEOC scrutiny over wellness program penalties";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices";" ##### Honeywell International Inc. on Wednesday called the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's recent lawsuit against the company over plans to penalize workers who refuse to participate in its workplace wellness program “frivolous” and “out of step.” ####  ##### The Morristown, N.J.-based multinational company informed employees at its facilities in Minnesota earlier this year that non-participation in wellness-related biometric screenings would result in a $500 annual surcharge on their 2015 health insurance premiums, the EEOC claims in a lawsuit filed Monday in a Minneapolis federal District Court. ####  ##### The lawsuit claims Honeywell also planned to withhold contributions to employees' tax-preferred health savings accounts worth up to $1,500 annually and assess an additional $1,000 tobacco surcharge against employees who refused to submit to the wellness screenings, which include tests for their blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and body mass. ####  ##### Similar penalties would also be assessed against employees' spouses enrolled in Honeywell's group health insurance plan if they refused to participate in the biometric tests, the EEOC said in its lawsuit. ####  ##### The agency's lawsuit accuses Honeywell of violating both the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act by effectively forcing employees and their spouses to submit to the health screenings, and seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the company from implementing the penalties. ####  ##### In a statement released on Wednesday, Honeywell said the wellness incentives attached to the biometric screening program comply with provisions of both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, “which were designed by Congress to encourage healthier lifestyles while helping to control healthcare costs.” ####  ##### “(The EEOC) is unfamiliar with the details of our wellness programs and woefully out of step with the healthcare marketplace and with the core intent of the Affordable Care Act to provide expanded access and improved healthcare to all Americans,” the company said in its statement. “No Honeywell employee has ever been denied healthcare coverage or disciplined in any way as a result of their voluntary decision not to participate in our wellness programs.” ####  ##### Honeywell added in its statement that its intent was to reward employees who do participate in the screenings by lowering their monthly premiums. ####  ##### “For employees with single coverage who voluntarily decide to take a biometric screening, their monthly premiums will be $125 lower than the employees who decide not to take a biometric screening,” the company's statement said. “Biometric results are strictly confidential and not shared with the Company.” ####  ##### The lawsuit against Honeywell is the third such action taken by the EEOC this year targeting employers whose workplace wellness programs exceed the agency's informal threshold of voluntary participation on the part of individual employees. Similar federal lawsuits were recently filed against a pair of Wisconsin-based employers, Orion Energy Systems Inc. and Flambeau Inc. ####  ##### Reacting to the news of the EEOC's lawsuit against Honeywell on Wednesday, employer advocacy groups criticized the agency for taking legal action against employers without first issuing formal guidance on its treatment of incentivized workplace wellness programs under the federal nondiscrimination statutes it enforces, including the ADA and GINA. ####  ##### “Employers have been seeking guidance for years from the EEOC regarding how the ADA and GINA apply to wellness programs, and it has failed to provide that guidance,” Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the Washington D.C.-based National Business Group on Health, said in an interview with Business Insurance. “Now they're coming out with legal action that basically conflicts with both the Affordable Care Act and HIPAA.” ####  ##### Gretchen Young, senior vice president for health policy at the Washington, D.C.-based ERISA Industry Committee, said in a statement that the EEOC appeared to be playing by “a different set of rules, with no forewarning to companies whatsoever.” ####  ##### “Even though large American companies have invested a huge amount of time, money, and manpower into making sure that their wellness programs comply with the ACA, now here comes the EEOC out of left field with a whole new set of rules and regulations to impose on these programs,” Ms. Young said. #### "

"House passes bill offering smaller employers relief from ACA coverage mandate ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### More small employers would be shielded from a health care reform law provision that requires employers to offer coverage or be liable for a stiff financial penalty under veterans-related legislation approved by the House of Representatives. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, employers with at least 100 full-time employees must offer coverage or be liable for a $2,000 per employee penalty, starting this year. In 2016, the 100-employee threshold for the so-called employer mandate drops to 50 employees and remains at that level in succeeding years. ####  ##### Under the legislation, H.R. 22, introduced by Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., and passed on a 412-0 vote Tuesday, employees who due to their military service receive health care coverage from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or the federal Tricare program would not be counted in calculating whether their employers hit the employment count threshold that triggers the ACA employer coverage mandate. ####  ##### Passage of the legislation will give smaller employers an additional incentive to hire veterans, Rep. Davis said in a statement. ####  ##### A companion bill was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. ####  ##### The House last year passed an identical bill, but it was not taken up by the Senate. #### "
"More employers move pre-Medicare retirees to exchanges, high-deductible plans";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, P/C Insurers, Retirement Benefits, Towers Watson";" ##### Employers are considering a variety of approaches to better control the cost of health care coverage to pre-Medicare eligible retirees — including shifting to high-deductible plans and moving to private or public insurance exchanges, according to a survey released Tuesday. ####  ##### For example, 42% of employers surveyed by benefit consultant Towers Watson & Co. say they currently offer the early retirees a high-deductible health care plan linked to health savings accounts, with another 8% saying they are considering adopting such a design in 2016 or 2017. ####  ##### In addition, 45% of employers said they have placed a dollar cap on how much they will contribute toward the cost of coverage. ####  ##### Employers also are growing more confident that public exchanges— authorized by the health care reform law— could be a viable alternative to directly providing coverage to pre-Medicare eligible retirees. ####  ##### While only 8% of surveyed employers now have confidence in the public exchange approach, 35% are sanguine that the approach will be viable by 2017. ####  ##### In fact, in some cases, pre-Medicare eligible retirees could be better off when obtaining coverage through a public exchange. That is because lower-income, pre-Medicare eligible retirees — those earning less than 400% of the federal poverty level, which comes to $46,680 for an individual or $95,400 for a family of four — are eligible for federal premium subsidies to use to buy coverage in public exchanges. ####  ##### In fact, in one widely-discussed approach, employers can terminate their early retiree health plans and establish and contribute to health reimbursement arrangements for retirees. ####  ##### Retirees then have a choice: tap the HRA to pay health insurance premiums purchased through a public exchange or, particularly for lower-income retirees, skip the HRA contribution in favor of a likely larger federal premium subsidy to buy coverage. Alternatively, employers might also make a private insurance exchange available, with the retirees using the HRA contribution to obtain coverage through those exchanges. ####  ##### The Towers Watson survey is based on the responses of 144 employers. ####  ##### “Pre-65 retiree medical plan sponsors have been eagerly awaiting options to deliver value to their early retirees,” Trevis Parson, Towers Watson's chief health actuary in Philadelphia said in a statement. #### "
"Timken to buy Prudential annuity for pension benefits";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### North Canton, Ohio-based bearings and power transmissions manufacturer The Timken Co. said it is buying a group annuity to provide pension benefits to about 5,000 retirees and their beneficiaries. ####  ##### In the latest corporate move to reduce pension liability risks, Timken said Thursday that it will transfer about $600 million in pension plan obligations to Prudential Insurance Co. of America by purchasing the group annuity. ####  ##### The agreement covers about 5,000 U.S. retirees, or their survivors, who began receiving pension benefits prior to April 1, 2014. The liability transfer to Prudential is expected in April, Timken said. ####  ##### The deal will “reduce risk and protect participant benefits going forward,” Timken said in a statement. ####  ##### The purchase will be funded by pension plan assets and will not require cash contributions from the company, Timken said. ####  ##### At the end of 2013, Timken's pension plans were slightly overfunded with $3.3 billion in assets and $3.1 billion in liabilities, according to its 10-K report. ####  ##### Timken's move followed announcements last fall by Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola Solutions Inc. that it would shift about $3 billion in pension plan obligations for some 30,000 retirees through buying a group annuity from Prudential; and by New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which purchased a group annuity from Prudential to shift about $1.4 billion in pension obligations to the insurer. ####  ##### In 2012, General Motors Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. also signed multibillion-dollar pension buyout deals with Prudential. ####  ##### Benefit experts say more employers are expected to take such actions, which transfer the benefit obligations to an insurer, eliminate their exposure to fluctuating interest rates, save on premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., as well as save on costs associated with offering and administering their pension plans. ####  ##### “Companies are looking for ways to achieve contribution certainty and eliminate funding volatility so they can put greater focus on their core business and still meet their obligations to their plan participants and retirees,” said Susan Cannilla, a vice president with Prudential Retirement's pension and structured solutions business in Woodbridge, New Jersey. #### "

Earnings per share were $5.70, above what CEO Stephen Hemsley predicted at the company's investor day in December. ####  ##### Last year was expected to be one of the most challenging for health insurers. Health care reform instituted cuts to the Medicare Advantage program, and 2014 was also the first year of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act exchanges, which presented a level of uncertainty and volatility. ####  ##### But UnitedHealth closed the books in 2014 with near-record profits and easily the most revenue in the Minnetonka, Minnesota-based company's history. Full-year revenue reached $130.5 billion, up 6.5% from 2013. ####  ##### Members of UnitedHealthcare, the company's health insurance subsidiary, continued to utilize fewer health care services, as the company's medical-loss ratio for the year came in at 80.9%, down from 81.5% in 2013. ####  ##### UnitedHealth's consulting and data analytics arm, Optum, also remained the most profitable component of the company.

"CVS warns new cholesterol drugs could break the health care bank";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, CVS Caremark, Health Care Costs";" ##### (Reuters) — CVS Health on Monday warned that costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments and other specialty drugs in development could eclipse those of expensive new medicines and overwhelm the health care system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” ####  ##### CVS, the second largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager which negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans, noted that two of the new injectable cholesterol fighters — called PCSK9 inhibitors — could be approved by mid-2015 and likely each cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year. ####  ##### All told, PCSK9 inhibitors could eventually cost the healthcare system as much as $150 billion a year and become the highest-selling class of drugs in history, CVS said. ####  ##### “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. ####  ##### The company added that the sky-high prices of the new cholesterol drugs could pave the way for other very costly specialty drugs. ####  ##### CVS' call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians of the high costs of recently approved oral treatments for hepatitis C, especially two brands from Gilead Science Inc. that have retail prices of up to $94,500. ####  ##### Those drugs wipe out the liver virus in more than 90% of patients and don't need to be used beyond 12 weeks for most patients. By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed “for the duration of patients' lives” and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans. ####  ##### Amgen Inc. and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol — a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used for those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc.'s Lipitor. ####  ##### The experimental treatments, in combination with statins, knocked down their levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by as much as 60% more than statins alone. ####  ##### Gilead's Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another of its anti-viral medicines into a daily pill, won U.S. approval late last year and has a retail price of $94,500. By itself, Sovaldi's list price is $84,000 per treatment. ####  ##### Gilead has acknowledged negotiating price discounts with payers of more than 40% for the two hepatitis C brands, as it vies for market share with a newer rival therapy from AbbVie called Viekira Pak. ####  ##### Shares of Amgen were up 0.8% on Tuesday on the Nasdaq, while Regeneron's stock gained 2.2%.

"California pension reform measure to target CalPERS";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### (Reuters) — A ballot measure campaign to cut California's public pensions will be launched in May by a coalition of politicians and business people led by former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, with the state's largest retirement system a prime target. ####  ##### The measure would take aim at California's $300 billion giant CalPERS, which has a near-iron grip on the state's pensions. CalPERS, America's largest public pension fund and administrator of pensions for more than 3,000 state and local agencies, has long argued that pensions cannot be touched or renegotiated, even in bankruptcy. ####  ##### ""CalPERS has dedicated itself to preserving the status quo and making it difficult for anybody to reform pensions,"" Mr. Reed said in an interview. ""This is one way to take on CalPERS and, yes, CalPERS will push back."" ####  ##### CalPERS spokeswoman Rosanna Westmoreland said: ""Pensions are an integral part of deferred compensation for public employees and a valuable recruitment and retention tool for employers."" ####  ##### The measure will be closely watched by reformers and their union opponents in other states in an ongoing national battle between those who say public pensions are putting intolerable strains on budgets and those who argue pension cuts unfairly penalize retirees and workers. ####  ##### For most California cities, their largest debt is pension liability, a significant factor in the recent bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino. CalPERS has said it will increase pension contributions for most cities by up to 50% in the coming years. ####  ##### Mr. Reed, a Democrat, abandoned a similar statewide ballot initiative in 2014, claiming that Kamala Harris, California's Democratic attorney general, had approved wording of the initiative that was biased and union-friendly. ####  ##### But he vowed to fight on after leaving office in December, and in an interview with Reuters confirmed for the first time the launch of the initiative and its timing, while noting that a major motive was to challenge CalPERS' grip. ####  ##### Mr. Reed says the push will seek to place a simpler, more legally watertight pension reform measure on California's November 2016 ballot, giving mayors and other local government executives the authority to renegotiate contracts. ####  ##### To win a place on the 2016 ballot, backers of the initiative will have to obtain the signatures of 585,000 registered voters, or 8% of the number of voters in California's last gubernatorial election, in this case 2014. ####  ##### Mr. Reed and his allies have been huddling with legal advisers for months to devise a voter initiative that is simpler and less vulnerable to court challenges than last year's effort. ####  ##### They have also been buoyed by a ruling in the recent municipal bankruptcy of Stockton, whose judge said California's public pensions are not inviolate. ####  ##### As San Jose mayor, Mr. Reed helped pass a pension reform measure for his city, parts of which have been struck down after union lawsuits. ####  ##### Mr. Reed is working with other pension reform advocates, including former San Diego Republican council member Carl DeMaio, the primary backer of a pension reform initiative in San Diego that was approved by voters in 2012; and the Ventura County Taxpayers Association's David Grau. ####  ##### ""We have done a lot of legal work to make sure this initiative is bulletproof,"" Mr. DeMaio said. ""Because the unions are going to throw the kitchen sink at us."" ####  ##### The group is talking to potential financial backers, Mr. Reed said. Last year, Mr. Reed took $200,000 from a group funded by Texas hedge fund billionaire John Arnold and they could partner again this time round, he said. ####  ##### Karol Denniston, a public finance attorney and pension expert at Squire Patton Boggs in San Francisco, said voters should be working for legal change to provide more options than municipal bankruptcy: ""Right now CalPERS has no program for financially distressed cities,"" Ms. Denniston said. ####  ##### Dave Low, executive director of the California School Employees Association, said the group would campaign to defeat the measure and was ""confident we can defeat it."" #### "
"Illinois deferred compensation plan sets auto re-enrollment";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The Illinois State Board of Investment is automatically re-enrolling all 52,000 participants in the $4.1 billion Illinois State Employees' 457 Deferred Compensation Plan, based in Springfield, driving members out of the most popular investment option in the process. ####  ##### The purpose of the re-enrollment is to push participants into target-date funds, considered by board staffers to be more risk appropriate for building retirement income than other investment options in the plan, said William R. Atwood, executive director of the Chicago-based ISBI, which also oversees the investment of $15.1 billion in defined benefit assets. ####  ##### “We're trying to get the plan consistent with best practices because we have an outsized allocation (23.3% of total fund assets) to small-cap growth,” Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### The huge allocation to the Columbia Acorn Z mutual fund is a result of the longevity of the relationship, Mr. Atwood said. The fund has been in the plan's investment lineup for more than 30 years, many of which produced terrific performance. ####  ##### “Small-cap growth is a highly volatile asset class, but it can produce outsize returns on an absolute and relative basis,” Mr. Atwood said. “Acorn had done a good job, but the portfolio has changed over time,” as have the portfolio managers. ####  ##### Unusual move ####  ##### The re-enrollment, which is required of all participants and begins this month, is an unusual move for defined contribution plans, especially for public plans, consultants and researchers say. ####  ##### “It's a best practice (but whether to do it) depends on the makeup of the fund,” such as in terms of lack of diversity of participant allocations, said Brian Wrubel, president and CEO of Marquette Associates Inc., Chicago, the ISBI's investment consultant. ####  ##### Re-enrollments are designed “to steer (participants) into risk-appropriate funds,” Mr. Wrubel said. ####  ##### Keith Brainard, Georgetown, Texas-based research director, National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he hasn't run across any other public DC plans that have conducted auto re-enrollments. ####  ##### On the corporate side, the number of auto re-enrollments is small, but is “a number that is growing,” said Alison Borland, senior vice president of retirement strategy and solutions, Aon Hewitt, Lincolnshire, Illinois. ####  ##### Jacob O'Shaughnessy, adviser, Arnerich Massena Inc., a Portland, Oregon-based investment consulting firm, said such re-enrollments are rare, although more common among corporate defined contribution plans than public plans. ####  ##### But re-enrollment is ”more on the horizon for governmental programs” as executives there look more at outcomes as a result, in some cases, of diminished benefits, and at corporate best practices for guidance, Mr. O'Shaughnessy said. ####  ##### As part of the re-enrollment, ISBI is dropping the Columbia Acorn Z mutual fund, the plan's most popular investment option, for reasons of performance and portfolio characteristics, said Mr. Atwood. He said the portfolio, with $953 million in ISBI assets, “migrated away from a conventional small-cap (growth) fund” as ISBI classified it for participants. ####  ##### In all, 49% of the 457 plan's participants have some assets in the Acorn fund, Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### The Acorn fund is actively managed by Columbia Wanger Asset Management L.L.C., Chicago. It invests in U.S. small- and midcap growth companies, according to a Columbia year-end 2014 report. The fund returned 0.8% in 2014, underperforming the 5.6% return of its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth index, according to a report to the ISBI from Marquette. The fund also underperformed the benchmark for three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31, the report said. ####  ##### Carlos Melville, Columbia spokesman, declined to comment. ####  ##### ISBI is replacing the Columbia fund with the Franklin Small Cap Group Fund R6, managed by Franklin Templeton (BEN) Investments (BEN). Mr. Atwood estimates the Franklin fund will get a total $150 million of participant allocations, much less than the Columbia Acorn allocation, mainly because many participants driven to target-date funds in the re-enrollment will remain in them. ####  ##### As part of the re-enrollment, ISBI officials are changing the default option to T. Rowe Price Retirement Active Trusts target-date funds from a stable value fund managed by Invesco (IVZ) Advisers Inc., Atlanta. The stable value fund will remain an option. ####  ##### “Defaulting to a lifestyle option is considered best practices as defined by the Department of Labor,” Mr. Atwood said, noting ISBI officials look to the DOL for guidance even though the Illinois plan isn't regulated by the department. ####  ##### Now, the plan has 17 options, managed by 10 managers, and 12 T. Rowe Price target-date funds. After the changes, the plan will have 16 options, managed by 10 managers, and 13 T. Rowe Price target-date funds. ####  ##### Dropped will be an active small-cap value fund managed by Northern Trust Asset Management, Chicago, which has $46 million in assets. With the anticipated decline in assets from the re-enrollment, the fund couldn't qualify for the lower separate account fee, which is 0.6%compared to an industry average 0.97%. ####  ##### The re-enrollment will transform the aggregate allocation, Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### The current allocation is 47.7% total in eight U.S. equity funds, 20.5% in the stable value fund, 11.9% in 11 target date funds, 9% in the Fidelity Puritan balanced fund, 5.3% in two fixed-income funds, 3.5% in three non-U.S. equity funds and 2.1% in the Vanguard prime money market fund. ####  ##### Officials at Marquette and Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services, the plan's record keeper, estimate 80% to 85% of plan participants will default to the target-date funds and stay in them, Mr. Atwood said. ####  ##### Cautious ####  ##### Mr. Brainard was cautious about enthusiasm for re-enrollments. ####  ##### “All the participants (in the public defined contribution plan) presumably already have a (defined benefit) pension plan so the 457 is a supplemental retirement savings vehicle,” Mr. Brainard said. “The pension plan is a secure source of guaranteed income in retirement (so) ... participants should and could take more risk in the 457” plan. ####  ##### “Presumably plan participants have made a decision on how they want their assets invested,” Mr. Brainard said. “The plan sponsor is substituting its judgment.” ####  ##### Mr. Atwood responded: “One could argue that persons who participate in a defined benefit plan could afford to take more risk in a defined contribution plan. We aren't arguing against that. We just want to make sure participants are thoughtful in making that decision.” ####  ##### “We want them to ... (make any allocations) affirmatively through the re-enrollment process,” he added. ####  ##### Barry B. Burr writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Cigna profit up on strong revenue, growing customer base";"Benefits Management";"Cigna, Financial Results, Health Insurers";" ##### Cigna Corp. reported strong revenue gains and modest growth in net income for the first quarter of 2015, reflecting higher premiums and an increase in customers, the health insurer said Thursday. ####  ##### In its earnings statement, Cigna reported net income of $531 million, up 0.4% from the year-ago period, for the quarter ended March 31. ####  ##### The insurer’s total revenue grew 11% from the prior-year quarter to $9.47 billion. ####  ##### Cigna’s global health care segment, its largest business unit encompassing its commercial and government businesses, posted premiums and fees of $6.73 billion, up 12.3% from the first quarter of 2014, according to the earnings report. ####  ##### “We’ve had a good start to the year, with strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses driven by continued effective execution of our strategy,” Tom McCarthy, Cigna’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call Thursday with analysts. ####  ##### Mr. McCarthy said the growth in the global health segment was driven by customer growth in the commercial and government businesses, specialty contributions and rate actions. ####  ##### Cigna ended the quarter with 14.7 million global customers including about 200,000 new customers from Cigna’s acquisition of Piscataway, New Jersey-based QualCare Alliance Networks Inc., Mr. McCarthy said. ####  ##### Cigna President and CEO David Cordani said the firm will drive growth and create value “through investments in our business, strategic mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchase,” as well as expanding to new distribution marketplaces, geographic and buying segments. #### "
"Updated Form 5500, fiduciary hearings on Labor Department's summer calendar";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### The U.S. Department of Labor is planning a busy summer, Assistant Secretary Phyllis Borzi told attendees at the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans’ Washington legislative conference Monday, with an agenda that includes the new proposed fiduciary rule, an updated Form 5500 and ways to improve lifetime income statements. ####  ##### Ms. Borzi, who heads the Employee Benefits Security Administration, said that July 6 is the end of the comment period for a proposed new fiduciary standard, which will be followed by public hearings and another comment period. “So it’s a very long and open public process,” Ms. Borzi said. ####  ##### Also, she said her agency has spent the past two years looking at ways to improve the data collected in the Form 5500. One concern is getting more information on less traditional asset classes, which she said are not fully reported now. ####  ##### “The ‘other’ category is the exception that swallows the rule,” Ms. Borzi said. ####  ##### Officials there also want to improve the data collected on service providers’ fees and expenses, “with better, more targeted reporting so everybody has a better idea of what they are paying for what they are getting,” she said, adding that a draft proposal should be ready by late summer. ####  ##### “We are also getting ready to repropose an example of what a lifetime income statement might be,” Ms. Borzi said. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

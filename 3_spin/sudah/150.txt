"Planned out-of-pocket caps for health care could cost employers";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Consumer-driven Health Plans, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### New federal health care reform law regulatory guidance ends lingering uncertainty on how much in out-of-pocket costs employers with high-deductible plans can require employees to pick up. ####  ##### The guidance, jointly issued Tuesday by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, like earlier HHS guidance, leaves intact the maximum out-of-pocket expenses employers can require employees to pay before health plan coverage kicks in: $6,850 for single coverage and $13,700 for family coverage when the rules go into effect in 2016. ####  ##### The earlier HHS guidance also added a new and potentially costly requirement for employers, who will have to cap at $6,850 the maximum out-of-pocket expense any individual with family coverage — whether an employee or covered dependent — can be required to pay before family coverage kicks in. ####  ##### Specifically under the earlier guidance, the $6,850 annual cap on how much a plan participant can be required to pay, will apply, regardless if the individual has single or family coverage. ####  ##### But that earlier guidance triggered widespread confusion. That confusion was the result of several factors, including that the rules were only issued by HHS and that a reading of the text of regulations suggested to some that the cost-sharing limitations applied only to insured plans available in the individual and small-group market, and not to self-insured plans or large insured group plans. ####  ##### The latest guidance, issued in question-and-answer format by the three federal agencies with responsibility for implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, definitively and unambiguously, ends that uncertainty. ####  ##### “The self-only maximum annual limitation on cost sharing applies to each individual, regardless of whether the individual is enrolled in self-only coverage or in coverage other than self-only. Accordingly, the self-only maximum annual limitation on cost sharing applies to an individual who is enrolled in family coverage or other coverage that is not self-only coverage under a group health plan,” the agencies said. ####  ##### An example illustrates how the HHS-imposed “embedded” limit on out-of-pocket expenses will work: ####  ##### An employer plan has a $10,000 out-of-pocket expense limit for employees with family coverage. An employee's spouse incurs $15,000 in medical care expenses. The spouse's out-of-pocket expense will be capped at $6,850, the same cost-sharing limit that would be imposed if the individual had single coverage. ####  ##### The biggest impact on the new cost-sharing rules will be on employers with high-deductible plans. For example, an Aon Hewitt survey found that just 17% of large and midsize employers offering high-deductible health care plans with health savings accounts had an embedded out-of pocket limit. ####  ##### “This guidance will especially impact many employers with high deductible plans with HSAs, requiring significant plan design changes or increased costs,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. #### "
"AIG offers home appliance cover as voluntary benefit";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, AIG, Voluntary Benefits";" ##### American International Group Inc. has launched AIG Home Protection, a voluntary employee benefit to cover out-of-pocket expenses related to repairing or replacing home appliances and products. ####  ##### AIG Home Protection, available to employers with at least 2,500 employees, covers the costs of parts and labor to repair or replace mechanical and electrical failures on products within the home, the insurer said Tuesday in a statement. ####  ##### According to an AIG spokeswoman, AIG Home Protection offers annual aggregate limits of up to $5,000, while the maximum limit for each product category varies. ####  ##### The products covered include primary heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems, water heaters, washers, dryers, dishwashers, ranges and ovens, and refrigerators, AIG said in the statement. ####  ##### AIG Home Protection, which may be offered by employers as a voluntary benefit, is sold through AIG unit AIG Benefit Solutions and other employee benefit solution providers. #### "
"House committee OKs bill to repeal medical device tax";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Legislation approved Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee would repeal a health care reform law provision that imposes a 2.3% federal excise tax on manufacturers of medical devices. ####  ##### Revenue generated by the tax, which first went into effect two years ago, is used to help offset the cost of federal premium subsides provided to the lower-income uninsured who purchase coverage in public health care exchanges. ####  ##### The measure, H.R. 160, introduced by Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., and approved by the Ways and Means Committee on a 25-14 vote, would repeal the tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2013. ####  ##### “There are the laws that make no sense at all. Today, we tax medical devices — things like heart valves and pacemakers — the very things that save lives. It's an iron law of economics that when you tax something, you get less of it. So we've really got our wires crossed here,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement prior to the panel's vote. ####  ##### The bill, which has a whopping 281 co-sponsors, is expected to be considered by the full House of Representatives later this month. ####  ##### If the measure is approved, it will be the second time this year that House lawmakers have passed legislation to repeal part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### Earlier this year, the House approved a measure bumping up the health care law's definition of full-time employees to those working an average of 40 hours per work. The ACA now defines a full-time employee as one working an average of 30 hours per week. ####  ##### That definition is a key one for employers as the law imposes a $2,000-per-employee penalty on employers that don't offer coverage to at least 70% of their full-time employees this year, while in 2016 and succeeding years, the penalty will be triggered if an employer does not offer coverage to at least 95% of its full-time employees. ####  ##### The Senate has not acted on either measure. #### "

"Hormel gets final OK to fund benefits in captive";"Benefits Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Legislation & Regulation";" ##### Hormel Foods Corp. received final U.S. Labor Department authorization Friday to fund several employee benefit risks through its Vermont captive insurer. ####  ##### Hormel, the Austin, Minnesota-based producer and marketer of meat and other food products, will use the captive, Diversified Foods Insurance Co. L.L.C., to fund life and accidental death and dismemberment benefits for its employees. Policies will be issued by Zurich American Life Insurance Co. ####  ##### Hormel already uses its captive, which was licensed in 2012, to fund a variety of risks, including property, earthquake and terrorism. ####  ##### Hormel is the third employer this year to receive final approval from Labor Department regulators to fund benefit risks through their captive insurers. ####  ##### Earlier this year, the Labor Department approved captive benefit funding plans filed by Healthcare Services Group Inc., a Bensalem, Pennsylvania-based provider of management and other services to health care companies, to fund voluntary medical, life and short-term disability benefits through its New Jersey-based captive. ####  ##### Regulators also gave final approval to an application filed by Sealed Air Corp., a Charlotte, North Carolina-based packing materials manufacturer, to fund life and accidental death and dismemberment benefits through its Vermont-based captive insurer. ####  ##### All three employers sought Labor Department approval of their captive benefit funding applications through a regulatory review process known as ExPro. Under ExPro, the Labor Department must act within 45 days of a company request for an arrangement that would normally be barred by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ####  ##### To qualify for ExPro, an applicant has to cite two substantially similar individual exemptions approved in the past 10 years, or one similar exemption and one approved through ExPro within the past five years. ####  ##### In its application, Hormel cited an individual exemption The Coca-Cola Co. received in 2013 to fund group term life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment benefits through its South Carolina captive, and an exemption Intel Corp. received last year to reinsure similar benefits through its Hawaii captive. ####  ##### More employers are expected to use the ExPro approach in seeking regulatory approval for their captive benefit proposals, experts say. ####  ##### “We expect to see more captive employee benefits applications, and approvals, as favorable experience with ExPro continues to accumulate,” said George O'Donnell, technical director of global risk consulting at Aon Risk Solutions in Somerset, New Jersey, who filed Hormel's application. #### "
"Towers Watson names managing director for group exchanges";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Towers Watson";" ##### Towers Watson & Co. on Wednesday said Sherri Bockhorst has joined the company as a managing director of group exchange business. ####  ##### Based in St. Louis, Ms. Bockhorst in this new position will help the company “continue to drive innovation and outcomes” for employers through its OneExchange proprietary private health insurance exchange, Towers Watson said in a statement. ####  ##### Previously, Ms. Bockhorst launched and oversaw product strategy, operations, vendor/partner relations, and sales and marketing for the RightOpt private insurance exchange at Buck Consultants at Xerox. ####  ##### “From her long experience in the industry, (Ms. Bockhorst) brings deep knowledge and expertise in employee benefit strategy, health care delivery and consumer engagement,” Jim Foreman, managing director of Towers Watson’s exchange solutions business segment, said in the statement. “She’s been a leader in the development of the exchange industry and will help us continue to expand the success of our exchange solutions for active employees.” #### "
"Transgender benefits gain attention of employers";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### As awareness for transgender issues increases, more employers are including coverage for transition-related health care as a way to foster an inclusive workplace environment while attracting and retaining workers. ####  ##### These benefits, meant for individuals transitioning to the opposite sex, may include mental health counseling, hormone replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery. Some employers may even include coverage for facial feminization or reducing the Adam's apple, though most procedures considered cosmetic are not offered. ####  ##### Some employers who offer transgender-related benefits may provide coverage for surgical procedures of the genitalia and chest, but not hormone replacement therapy. Others may cover hormone therapy, but not surgical gender reassignment. ####  ##### There is no legal requirement for employers in the private sector to cover transition-related procedures, and few do so, but high-profile examples, such as Bruce Jenner's transition to Caitlyn, and a federal push for equal transgender rights may spur further adoption, experts say. ####  ##### A Mercer L.L.C. 2014 survey found that 8% of employers with 500 or more employees provided coverage for gender reassignment surgery in 2014, up from 5% in 2013. And 23% of employers with 10,000 or more employees offered coverage, flat from the previous year, according to the survey. ####  ##### Because of a lack of comprehensive data, it's difficult to pinpoint how many individuals in the United States identify as transgender. One regularly cited 2011 study by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law's Williams Institute estimates 700,000 individuals are transgender, not all of whom seek gender reassignment. ####  ##### A National Business Group on Health 2013 survey of large members, who NBGH said are typically at the forefront of benefits offerings, found that 60% planned to offer non-surgical transgender-related benefits in 2014, compared with 26% offering those benefits in 2007. Fifty percent of employers planned to offer transgender-related surgical benefits in 2014, up from 5% in 2007, according to the survey. ####  ##### More insurers, such as Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp., are offering coverage for transgender-related procedures as well. ####  ##### In the public sector, transgender health coverage is now widely available. The Office of Personnel Management on June 23 prohibited Federal Employee Benefit Plan providers from excluding transition-related care in their federal employee health plans, citing an “evolving professional consensus that treatment may be medically necessary” for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, that is distress caused by differences in a person's genetic sex and gender identity. ####  ##### That decision comes on the heels of the federal government's May 2014 decision to lift its ban on covering sex reassignment surgery under Medicare. ####  ##### “The federal employee health insurance programs set a tone and standard that will undoubtedly impact workers outside of the federal government,” a spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign said in an email. ####  ##### “Although this will not reach every private insurance provider, requiring those that participate in the federal program to provide complete, inclusive coverage will definitely change the way the insurance companies do business nationwide,” the spokeswoman for the Washington-based lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights advocacy group said. ####  ##### Dr. Michael Cryer, Houston-based medical director for Aon Hewitt, said he's seen more interest among employers in offering transgender health benefits this year than in the past, though adoption among his clients is still minimal. ####  ##### Most clients who offer transition-related health coverage believe it will give them an advantage when hiring employees, he said. ####  ##### “If they feel like they are in a marketplace where the other employers like themselves” offer transgender health benefits, “then they tend to offer it,” he said. ####  ##### For employers that don't offer transition-related coverage, “it's not specifically the procedure or the content of the benefit” influencing the decision, but the prospect that it could increase health care costs, he said. ####  ##### But experts say the cost to an employer is negligible compared with more common procedures, such as heart bypass surgery, partly because transgender incidence rates are very low. ####  ##### According to the NBGH survey, some employers report costs ranging from $14,000 to $500,000 yearly for the employee population, depending on the procedures. Others reported costs of gender reassignment benefits at 0.1-0.5% of total health care costs, NBGH said. The average employer responding to the survey had 35,000 employees, an NBGH spokesman said. ####  ##### “Many people are taking $100,000 dollar drugs now, so in comparison” the cost for offering transgender health benefits is “very small,” said Shari Davidson, Washington-based vice president with NBGH. Cost does not generally factor into the decision to offer the benefit even though some costs are ongoing, she said. ####  ##### Instead, those decisions are commonly rooted in science, and insurers and employers will cover treatments that are “medically necessary or no longer experimental,” Ms. Davidson said. ####  ##### Today, the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and other professional organizations say transition-related procedures are appropriate treatments for gender dysphoria. A psychiatrist will decide whether it is medically necessary for an individual to receive such treatment, according to Dr. Cryer. ####  ##### For TD Bank N.A., offering transgender health benefits “was part of our business case in having an inclusive environment,” said Cyndi DiCastelnuovo, Mount Laurel, New Jersey-based vice president of diversity and inclusion. ####  ##### “When employees feel their needs are met, and in this case from a benefits perspective, they perform at a higher level,” she said. ####  ##### TD Bank covers hormone therapy, 80% of transgender reassignment surgery expenses and general mental health services pre- and post-surgery, Ms. DiCastelnuovo said. The company does not cover cosmetic surgery. ####  ##### Ms. DiCastelnuovo said offering such benefits has helped attract and retain workers and create a “total value package for our LGBT employees.” ####  ##### For a private employer, especially those under a self-insured health plan, the risks involved in declining to offer transgender health coverage are small, but more attention on the issue has “increased potential for discrimination claims,” said Todd Solomon, a Chicago-based partner with law firm McDermott Will & Emery. ####  ##### And the number of employers offering transgender health coverage is expected to keep growing. ####  ##### “With or without (the Office of Personnel Management decision), a lot of private companies are looking to cover this. In fact, we've seen tremendous growth,” said Brenna Shebel, Washington-based vice president of NBGH. “We will see more of our members covering both nonsurgical and surgical gender reassignment benefits.” #### "
"ADP offers health exchange for full-time and contingent workers ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Human resources and benefits administration technology provider ADP L.L.C. has launched a private exchange that enables employers to assist both full-time employees and those ineligible for employer-sponsored coverage in selecting health plans. ####  ##### Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP's private exchange, launched Thursday, allows benefits-eligible employees to enroll in health plans within its existing human capital management and benefits administration platform, while also directing those part-time, temporary and contract workers to the public exchange offered through GoHealth L.L.C. ####  ##### Chicago-based exchange technology provider GoHealth powers a private health insurance exchange that also sells subsidized health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, ADP said in a statement Thursday. ####  ##### “Until now, many employers either did nothing or directed their workers who do not qualify for a group plan straight to public exchanges, where they would enroll in benefits and apply for federal subsidies often without assistance or their employer's knowledge,” ADP said. ####  ##### But ADP found that most employers are interested in assisting their benefits-ineligible workforce to enroll in health insurance as it will help them stay engaged and productive, Gerry Leonard, ADP's Alpharetta, Georgia-based president of benefit services, said. ####  ##### “There's a lot of companies who have a fairly large contingent workforce” who are not eligible for benefits through the company but are still obligated to “pick up health insurance,” Mr. Leonard said. ####  ##### Employers say “if we can easily make the products available for (contingent workers) and let them shop much more seamlessly, then we'd like to do that,” he said. ####  ##### On the GoHealth platform, employees will be able to apply for federal subsidies and compare health plans and prices. ####  ##### At the same time, employees eligible for employer-sponsored health insurance are able to shop for benefits offered through the employer's chosen insurance broker and can compare plans for price and coverage using decision support tools through ADP's exchange. ####  ##### USI Insurance Services Inc. is the first broker to partner with ADP's private exchange, but Mr. Leonard said ADP will partner with any broker or insurer. ####  ##### Currently, few employers offer employees access to a private health exchange, despite major benefits consultants, such as Towers Watson & Co. and Aon P.L.C., launching their own. ####  ##### According to the Society of Human Resource Management Inc., only 2% of employers moved to private exchanges in 2015. ####  ##### But Mr. Leonard expects more employers to shift employees to a private exchange model once the burden of compliance for the next enrollment season passes. ####  ##### “Once that wave passes, they'll move on to the next big issue, which is the excise tax” — the 40% tax on the portion of health plan premiums that exceeds $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage slated set to take effect in 2018 — he said. “They'll begin to ask for more innovative strategies to address that, and I think exchanges will begin to pick up again.” #### "
"Maximum FSA contributions expected to stay the same for 2016";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### With inflation running low, the maximum contribution employees will be able to make to their flexible spending accounts in 2016 is expected to remain unchanged, according to the latest government statistics. ####  ##### • A  Business Insurance guide to the latest requirements for FSAs, HSAs, employer pension plans, wellness and more ####  ##### The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that through the 12-month period ending in July, the consumer price index rose just 0.2%. ####  ##### Barring a big surge in inflation in August, the current $2,550 maximum is likely to remain in place next year, experts say. ####  ##### • UPDATE: MAX FSA CONTRIBUTION STAYS AT $2,550 for 2016 ####  ##### • 'Cadillac' tax complicates open enrollment ####  ##### • Benefits enrollment season opens ####  ##### The maximum FSA contribution limit and how that limit can increase are mandated by provisions in the 2010 health care reform law. ####  ##### One Affordable Care Act provision set a $2,500 annual limit on FSA contributions effective in 2013. Prior to that limit, employers typically allowed employees to contribute between $3,000 and $5,000 to their FSAs, said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### Another provision specified that starting in 2014, the new limit would increase to match the rise in CPI at the close of a 12-month period ending on Aug. 31, with the increase rounded down to the nearest $50. ####  ##### In the first 12-month period, ending in August 2013, the rise in CPI resulted in an indexed amount of $2,542, which, when rounded down to the nearest $50, resulted in no increase in the maximum FSA contribution limit in 2014. ####  ##### Last year, inflation rose just enough to boost the limit to $2,550 for 2015. With the CPI barely rising since August 2014, it would take a big hike in inflation this month — unlikely given falling energy prices, for example — to boost the CPI enough to trigger a rise in the maximum FSA contribution limit for 2016, Mr. Stover said. ####  ##### While FSAs are still a part of many employers' benefit programs, employee contribution and participation rates have been falling. According to benefit consultant Aon Hewitt, the average FSA contribution per participant fell to $1,342 in 2015, down from $1,405 in 2014, while 17% of employees working for employers offering FSAs made contributions in 2015, down from 20% the prior year. ####  ##### Aon Hewitt says a likely reason for decreases are the increased popularity of consumer-driven health care plans linked to health savings accounts or health reimbursement arrangements. ####  ##### Last year, according to a Mercer L.L.C., survey, 23% of employees were enrolled in CDHPs, up from 18% in 2013, the biggest one-year increase since Mercer began to track CDHP enrollment about a decade ago. ####  ##### The reasons for those increases are many. The maximum amount of salary employees can contribute to HSAs is much higher than for FSAs, while unused HSA contributions remaining at the end of a year can be rolled over for use in succeeding years. By contrast, unused FSAs must be forfeited by the March 15 of the following year. The IRS does allow — for employers who have adopted the provision — unused FSA contributions to be rolled over, but only up to $500. ####  ##### Another factor that could further erode the prevalence of FSAs is a provision in the ACA that, starting in 2018, imposes a 40% excise tax on the portion of health care premiums exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. The ACA counts FSA contributions towards that excise tax trigger, a key reason some employers will eliminate their FSAs, Mr. Stover said. #### "
"Employer groups wary of new out-of-pocket health maximums";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### Employer groups voiced their support this week for congressional questioning of a potentially costly change to employee cost-sharing rules under the health care reform law. ####  ##### The Republican chairmen of three House committees on Friday asked U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to justify federal regulators' recent “clarification” of health care reform rules that places new limits on how much employers — primarily those offering high-deductible health plans — can require employees to pay in out-of-pocket expenses. ####  ##### Under that guidance, issued in May by HHS and the U.S. Labor and Treasury Departments, the maximum expenses employees can be required to pay before health plan coverage kicks in will be $6,850 for single coverage and $13,700 for family coverage. The rules take effect in 2016. ####  ##### However, the guidance also added a new and potentially expensive requirement for employers, who will have to cap at $6,850 the maximum out-of-pocket costs individual employees and dependents covered under a family plan can be required to pay before first-dollar coverage kicks in. ####  ##### In their letter sent Friday, Reps. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; John Kline, R-Minn., chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee; and Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asked what statutory authority Obama administration regulators have to set such caps. They also questioned why the policy change was made in the preamble and not in the regulation itself. ####  ##### The committee chairmen said they have “become increasingly concerned about agencies' actions to implement the law that appears to exceed the statutory authority delegated to them by Congress.” ####  ##### An example illustrates how the HHS-imposed “embedded” limit on out-of-pocket expenses will work: An employer plan has a $10,000 out-of-pocket expense limit for employees with family coverage. An employee's spouse incurs $15,000 in medical care expenses. The spouse's out-of-pocket expense will be capped at $6,850, the same cost-sharing limit that would be imposed if the individual had single coverage. ####  ##### “Our position is that we don't think the statute allows for this kind of interpretation,” Debbie Harrison, assistant director of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington, said Tuesday. ####  ##### The cost-sharing rules will hit employers with high-deductible plans hardest. An Aon Hewitt survey found that just 17% of large and midsize employers offering high-deductible health care plans with health savings accounts had an out-of-pocket limit. ####  ##### “To get that guidance at such a late date, which basically means that employers have to redo their out-of-pocket limits for family coverage, is going to cause a pretty substantial scramble in order to comply,” Ms. Harrison said. “We were hoping that they would at least delay implementing the rule for a year, just to give employers time to make those adjustments, but we're not really sure that's going to happen.” ####  ##### Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, said Friday that her organization was “pleased that Chairman Kline directly questioned Secretary Burwell about this issue at a recent hearing and that the three committees of jurisdiction are concerned about how this guidance was developed and whether its impact on employers and employees was properly considered.” #### "
"Sears reaches agreement with PBGC";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Sears Holdings Corp. reached a five-year agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to protect pension fund assets following a REIT joint venture with Seritage Growth Properties, the company announced Friday. ####  ##### The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company agreed to protect the assets of certain special purpose subsidiaries holding real estate and/or intellectual property assets. Those subsidiaries will grant PBGC a “springing lien” on the protected assets. The lien would be triggered if the company fails to make required contributions to its pension plan, makes prohibited transfers of ownership interests, terminates the plan or files for bankruptcy. ####  ##### As of Jan. 1, the company's U.S. pension fund had $3.62 billion in assets and $5.88 billion in liabilities, for a funding ratio of 61.56%. ####  ##### Sears froze its pension plan in 2006. ####  ##### In a statement, Sears said it will continue to make required pension contributions, and that it does not foresee a basis for an involuntary or distress plan termination. The PBGC agreed to not initiate an involuntary termination. ####  ##### “This agreement results from good faith discussions between the PBGC and the company and is another positive step forward for the company; it provides meaningful protections to the PBGC while preserving the company's financial and operational ability to continue implementing the transformation,"" said Edward S. Lampert, Sears Holdings' chairman and CEO. ####  ##### PBGC said the agreement, which is conditioned on completion of definitive documentation in the next 60 days, provides meaningful protections to the Sears plan's 200,000 participants, and to the agency's pension insurance program. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"NLRB's joint-employer decision opens worker benefits to potential changes";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The National Labor Relations Board's controversial decision to expand the definition of “joint employer” could have costly implications for employers when it comes to the health and retirement benefits they provide, benefits lawyers say. ####  ##### It's a “huge decision and (there are) implications for benefits and every aspect of employer-employee relationships,” said Ricki Roer, New York-based partner and national chair of the employment and labor team with law firm Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker L.L.P. “Nothing is going to be off the table” for collective bargaining, she said. ####  ##### In a 3-2 decision on Aug. 27, the NLRB ruled that Browning-Ferris Industries of California Inc. is a joint employer with Leadpoint Business Services, a staffing agency hired to supply workers for one of its recycling plants. The Teamsters union had filed a petition to represent the Leadpoint workers and sought the right to collectively bargain with Browning-Ferris rather than Leadpoint, arguing that the two are joint employers. ####  ##### In its ruling, the NLRB changed the standard for how it determines joint employers by considering whether a company exerts control indirectly through an intermediary over matters of employment. Historically, the NLRB has considered a company to be a joint employer if it exercises “direct and immediate control” over employees, according to the decision. ####  ##### The new standard is “to better effectuate the purposes of the (National Labor Relations) Act in the current economic landscape,” the NLRB said in a statement accompanying its ruling. ####  ##### But the new standard potentially opens up any employer that hires contract employees for services to a host of liabilities, experts say. ####  ##### “Employers now are exposed to contributing a lot more money to benefits if they are jointly employing,” said James Sconzo, a shareholder at law firm Carlton Fields Jorden Burt in Hartford, Connecticut. Because the definition of joint employer is “ill-defined,” he said, there's a “cascade of, I think, unintended consequences.” ####  ##### Contract workers for small and large companies, including franchise workers, could now theoretically unionize to bargain for benefits and other terms of employment, he said. Of course, there would be an expensive legal fight before that happens, he said. ####  ##### “This is going to open the door for collective bargaining for employee benefits and so much more,” Ms. Roer agreed. ####  ##### Browning-Ferris could appeal the NLRB's decision, but the ruling is “a clear indication that this is a path we're moving in,” Ms. Roer said. There's a trend of employers increasingly seen as responsible for individuals rendering work for the organization, regardless of “whose name appears on the paystub,” she said. ####  ##### The decision “can lead down the road to benefit implications,” said Ben Conley, Chicago-based employee benefits attorney with Seyfarth Shaw L.L.P. However, “I don't think we're there yet,” he said. ####  ##### While the U.S. Department of Labor and now the NLRB have taken a more expansive view on who the employer is, “the last shoe to drop will be the IRS,” Mr. Conley said, because the Internal Revenue Service drives most benefits considerations. ####  ##### “If the IRS starts broadening the scope of who they consider to be your employees, then it's really going to change the landscape,” he said, because if parent companies are required to offer contract workers benefits “regardless of whether you hire them from a temporary staffing agency or not,” there is less of a reason to use a “middleman.” ####  ##### That could cause “people to revisit … what their hiring practices are,” he said. #### "
"Bipartisan Senate bill aims for Cadillac tax repeal ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Health Care Costs";" ##### Bipartisan legislation introduced Thursday in the Senate would repeal the health care reform law's so-called Cadillac tax. ####  ##### Under that provision, a 40% excise tax, starting in 2018, will be imposed on the portion of group health care plan premiums exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. ####  ##### An earlier analysis by benefit consultant Towers Watson & Co. projected that 48% of employers with at least 5,000 employees that offer health plans could be hit by the excise tax in 2018, with 82% affected by 2023. ####  ##### The legislation, introduced by Sens. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., would repeal the tax on Dec. 31, 2017, just before its effective date. ####  ##### “Doing away with this onerous tax on employees' health coverage before it goes into effect will protect important benefits for workers and ensure businesses and families get a fair deal,” Sen. Heinrich said in a statement. ####  ##### Business groups strongly back repeal of the tax. “The effect of the 40% excise tax goes beyond employers; it could be detrimental to the health of millions of employees and their families if employers are forced to curtail their health benefits in order to avoid the tax,” Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, said in a statement. ####  ##### “Repealing the 40% tax, thereby preserving high-quality employer-sponsored health coverage, should and would be a bipartisan, bicameral success story,” said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington and a member of the diverse Alliance to Fight the 40 coalition recently organized to fight the excise tax. ####  ##### Similar legislation, H.R. 2050, was earlier introduced in the House by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn. That measure now has 145 co-sponsors. #### "
"House panel approves bill restoring use of FSAs, HSAs to pay for OTC drugs ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Health Care Costs";" ##### Employees again would be able to tap their flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts and health reimbursement arrangements to pay for over-the-counter medications without a doctor's prescription under legislation approved Thursday by the House Ways and Means Committee. ####  ##### This legislation, H.R. 1270, earlier introduced by Reps. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and approved by the panel on a voice vote, would reverse a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, effective in 2011, that stripped away employees' ability to use their FSAs, HSAs and HRAs to pay for over-the-counter medications, except for insulin. ####  ##### This legislation “will help so many families across the country,” said Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., just prior to the committee's vote, referring to the restoration of the tax break. ####  ##### On the other hand, restoring the tax break would only be “fair if everyone is treated the same,” said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., referring to individuals not covered by FSAs, HSAs or HRAs, who would continue to pay for OTC medications with after-tax dollars. #### "

"Aegon says reviewing U.K. annuities business";"Benefits Management";"P/C Insurers, Retirement Benefits, Netherlands, United Kingdom";" ##### (Reuters) — Dutch insurer Aegon N.V. said it was reviewing its U.K. annuities business after British pension reform has led to a halving in annuity sales. ####  ##### Pension changes announced last year and introduced in April mean over-55s no longer need to use their pension pots to buy an annuity, which gives a fixed income for life. ####  ##### ""As part of our on-going review of our portfolio of businesses, and our focus on drawdown and guaranteed products, we have initiated a review of our annuity portfolio in the U.K.,"" Aegon U.K. Chief Executive Adrian Grace said in an internal memo seen by Reuters. ####  ##### Providers of more flexible drawdown pensions have reported an increase in demand since the reforms, while specialist annuity providers Just Retirement Group P.L.C. and Partnership Assurance Group P.L.C. agreed to merge last month. ####  ##### Annuities are also a capital-intensive business under new Solvency II capital rules due to come into force in January, insurance specialists say. ####  ##### Aegon's shares have fallen more than 20% after the firm said last month it expected a dip in its solvency ratio under the new rules. ####  ##### Aegon's shares were down 1.7% at 1030 GMT, underperforming a 0.5% drop in European insurance stocks. #### "
"Financial education works as another angle on employee wellness ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Voluntary Benefits";" ##### ORLANDO, Fla. — Financial education should be folded into existing wellness programs to help employees alleviate stress from money matters, increase productivity and avoid stress-related health problems, benefits professionals say. ####  ##### “There's a solid, solid argument around how focusing on (financial wellness) is good for the company,” Jeffrey Tulloch, Westport, Connecticut-based vice president of MetLife Inc.'s financial programs PlanSmart and Business Advantage, said Tuesday during the 2015 Employer Healthcare & Benefit Congress in Orlando, Florida. “It's great for the employee — we all need this — but done correctly, it can help drive productivity.” ####  ##### Most employees enter the workplace after schooling with no financial education and are ill-equipped to handle their personal finances, he said. ####  ##### The lack of knowledge leads can lead to stress in the workplace, reduced productivity and increased medical spending from stress-related conditions, he said. ####  ##### But employers that have wellness programs can “leverage them to really help change people's lives,” Mr. Tulloch said. ####  ##### Workers are looking for help, he said, citing a 2014 MetLife study that found 49% of employees had no access to workplace financial education but were interested in having such programs. ####  ##### When designing a financial wellness program, Mr. Tulloch recommended tailoring the curriculum to meet employee needs. If a company has a diverse workforce, the program needs to be broad enough to cover all demographics' financial issues. ####  ##### Employers also need to drive engagement and participation in the program through strong workplace communications, he said. ####  ##### Georgetown University, which launched financial wellness as part of its total wellness program in 2007, offers monthly financial wellness workshops and an annual financial education conference focusing on topics that include buying a home, saving to pay for children's college and caring for aging parents, Charles DeSantis, chief benefits officer of the Washington-based university, said during the session. ####  ##### Georgetown's annual conference sees 20% of its 5,000 benefits-eligible employees attend, he said. ####  ##### Financial education is an essential component of an organization's holistic wellness strategy, Mr. DeSantis said. ####  ##### “It has to be part of your wellness program, because people are well when they are doing something about their finances or thinking about it, and when they are actually taking care of their health,” both mind and body, he said. ####  ##### The first step, he said, is to simply get workers to begin thinking about the subject by letting them know financial education is available. It's also necessary to conduct all education workshops during work hours and include an employee's entire family in the program, he said. ####  ##### It's important not to view results in terms of the return on investment. Instead, providing tools for people to improve their finances and retirement readiness is about making workers feel valued and cared for, Mr. DeSantis said. #### "

"U.S. insurers hold back Lilly's death-defying diabetes drug";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Cigna, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### (Reuters) — America's largest health insurers are urging doctors to stick with current standard treatments for diabetes instead of flocking to a new drug from Eli Lilly & Co. that is showing it can provide life-saving results for one-third of patients. ####  ##### Aetna Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Molina Healthcare Inc. said they would need further clinical data and a change in medical society guidelines on Lilly's Jardiance before agreeing to make it easier for patients to receive the $4,800-a-year treatment. That's a process that could take anywhere from 18 months to several years. ####  ##### UnitedHealth Group Inc., Anthem Inc., Express Scripts and Cigna Corp. said they would also still adhere to the traditional treatment regime based largely on cheaper generic drugs and carefully review the data before making any changes. ####  ##### Their stance is likely to disappoint investors who are betting that Jardiance will leap from $11 million in global sales last quarter to $5 billion annually by 2020. Lilly reported last month that Jardiance slashed cardiovascular deaths by 38% in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading Wall Street analysts to predict it would become widely used in the United States. How the drug does this is a mystery given its mild benefits of lowering blood pressure, blood sugar and weight. ####  ##### “It always makes me nervous when we have a drug that we can't explain,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, who runs Medicaid provider Molina Healthcare based in Long Beach, California. “Before we rush out and adopt this on a wide basis, we need more studies and other drugs tested as well.” ####  ##### Lilly shares rose nearly 10% when it disclosed the Jardiance data, but have since given back those gains amid a wider selloff among biotech stocks. Lilly and its partner, German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, sponsored the Jardiance trial, which was conducted in hospitals and research centers in 42 countries. ####  ##### But the cumulative costs of treating the large number of patients with type 2 diabetes — the most common form, with 24 million sufferers in the U.S. — year after year is giving insurers pause, adding to a debate over whether the high price of U.S. medicines is justified by their ability to fight disease. Most patients with type 2 diabetes, which is highly linked to obesity, die of heart disease. ####  ##### Competing drugs such as Merck & Co.'s Januvia or Novo Nordisk's Victoza carry similar price tags to Jardiance. Doctors may want to prescribe Jardiance instead of those therapies, which have not shown the same ability to prevent deaths from heart attack or stroke. Jardiance, approved last year, may also replace other drugs, such as generic sulfonylureas. ####  ##### They may turn to Jardiance earlier on, or even use it instead of metformin, the $60-a-month generic that is usually the first prescription written for a diabetic. ####  ##### Insurers allow their members to use Jardiance or others in the same class but typically charge a higher patient co-payment and may reimburse its use only after metformin is taken for a number of months. ####  ##### JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note he expects the Jardiance data to drive growth over time and will be watching for prescriptions to pick up in late 2016 or 2017. He expects 2016 sales to rise to $837 million. ####  ##### Other potential uses for the drug could add millions of more prescriptions not yet factored in by Wall Street. The results on diabetic patients are leading cardiologists to consider testing the drug on non-diabetics at risk of heart disease. The American Heart Association will feature a discussion of Jardiance's prospects at its annual meeting in November. ####  ##### Slow down ####  ##### Insurers, who were as surprised by the data as the investors, said Wall Street should slow down. Many want to see if a similar treatment from Johnson & Johnson, Invokana, shows comparable benefits in clinical trial results expected in 2017. ####  ##### That would give insurers a stronger case to pit Lilly and the makers of similar drugs against each other, a tactic they employed with Gilead Sciences Inc.'s blockbuster hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi earlier this year after a competitor hit the market. They have also enforced coverage policies that are slowing down the expansion of new cholesterol fighters from Amgen Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. ####  ##### David Kendall, vice president of medical affairs for Lilly's diabetes franchise, said he hopes insurers will allow greater use of Jardiance as soon as possible, and that medical societies will promptly update their treatment guidelines to prescribe Jardiance instead of other treatments. ####  ##### “We would hope undue delay isn't an outcome; we would hope for timely decision-making,” Mr. Kendall said. ####  ##### Excess glucose ####  ##### Jardiance, a pill taken once daily, is among the class of drugs known as SGLT2 inhibitors which work by helping the kidneys excrete more excess glucose in urine. This class of drugs can produce side effects including a higher rate of infection and a potentially fatal condition involving excess acid in the blood. ####  ##### The global market for SGLT2 inhibitors reached $400 million last year, with Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca P.L.C. in the lead, according to brokerage Cowen and Co. Generic pills and insulin are the most widely used treatments in the $36 billion global diabetes drug market. ####  ##### “It could be 2017 before insurance companies will advocate this as a preferred agent,” said Dr. Carol Wysham, head of the diabetes and endocrinology department at Rockwood Clinic in Spokane, Washington. “They aren't going to do anything until they have to.” ####  ##### CVS, like other insurers, wants to hear from the nation's top medical groups on diabetes and see the results of more studies. In addition to Johnson & Johnson's long-term Invokana study, AstraZeneca is conducting a study on Farxiga, which is due in 2019. Either one could suggest whether Jardiance alone prevents death in a high percentage of diabetes patients, or whether it is a shared trait of the drug class. ####  ##### “There is a lot more to be gained in making sure that people are taking older, less expensive drugs than there is in adding new more expensive drugs into the mix,” CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan said in an interview, referring to the problem of patients skipping on their medications. “I see no indication from this study of a wholesale change in the treatment outline.” ####  ##### The American Diabetes Association, the Joslin Diabetes Center and the Endocrine Society said they need to gather specialist doctors and review the data to consider whether to draft new treatment guidelines, a process that would likely take a year or two. ####  ##### Aetna's chief medical officer for pharmacy, Dr. Edmund Pezalla, described the data as a “pleasant surprise” and said Jardiance has the potential to save medical costs for patients down the road. ####  ##### The company, which prefers customers use J&J's Invokana over Jardiance, is preparing for an increase in use. “We probably are not going to see everybody going onto these medications,” Dr. Pezalla said. “We do see changes in utilization when studies that are positive come out.” ####  ##### Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, treats diabetes as part of his cardiology practice. He has never prescribed Jardiance but said he would probably do so now, beginning gradually and prescribing it earlier than current guidelines suggest. ####  ##### “I try to be responsible about cost-effective prescribing, but most people are not controlled on metformin alone,” he said. #### "
"Public health insurance exchange enrollment expected to grow in 2016";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Enrollment in public health insurance exchanges is expected to grow modestly in 2016, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services analysis released Thursday. ####  ##### By the end of 2016, enrollment in the exchanges — a key component of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — is expected to range from 9.4 million to 11.4 million, up from an HHS-projected enrollment of 9.1 million at the end of 2015. ####  ##### Exchange enrollment at year-end 2016 of 10 million individuals “is a strong and realistic goal,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement accompanying the report. ####  ##### “We've seen high levels of satisfaction with the (exchange) marketplace and expect the vast majority of our current customers will re-enroll,” Ms. Burwell added. ####  ##### In its enrollment projections, HHS estimates that between 7.3 million to 8.8 million individuals — mostly lower-income Americans eligible for federal premium subsidies — now enrolled in plans offered through the exchanges will select or automatically enroll in exchange plans next year. ####  ##### In addition, between 2.8 million and 3.9 million uninsured individuals will opt for coverage during the 2016 open enrollment, while between 900,000 and 1.5 million individuals who now have coverage outside the exchanges will select an exchange plan in 2016. ####  ##### Combining those projections, HHS estimates that between 11 million and 14.1 million individuals will sign up for coverage during open enrollment, which generally begins on Nov. 1. ####  ##### But by year-end 2016, enrollment will be lower compared to the number of people who signed up for coverage during open enrollment. ####  ##### “As is the case with any well-functioning market, HHS expects to see customers come and go as their life circumstances change,” such as when enrollees drop coverage when they land jobs and become eligible for employment-based coverage, HHS said. #### "

"Conservative objections complicate Cadillac tax repeal";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### The likelihood of Congress passing legislation to repeal the health care reform law's “Cadillac” tax is deteriorating amid an unlikely loss of support: conservative Republicans. ####  ##### Three GOP senators said last week that they would oppose a provision in a budget reconciliation bill that would repeal a 40% excise tax on premiums that exceed $10,200 for single overage and $27,500 for family coverage that is to begin in 2018. ####  ##### The reason Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Mike Lee, R-Utah; and Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; oppose the bill: They want the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act repealed. ####  ##### “If this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules, we cannot support this bill,” the senators said in statement referring to the budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 3762, that contains the excise tax repeal provision, which the House of Representatives passed last week. ####  ##### “With millions of Americans now getting health premium increase notices in the mail, we owe our constituents nothing less,” the senators said. ####  ##### The GOP lawmakers' opposition plus the near certainty that President Barack Obama would veto the budget bill further decreases chances that lawmakers will repeal the tax, observers say. ####  ##### “It is a blow,” said Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, adding that repealing the tax during the current congressional session always has been a long shot. ####  ##### Repeal will “become harder,” added Damian Myers, a senior associate at law firm Proskauer Rose L.L.P. in Washington, who said backers of repealing the excise tax cannot afford to lose any more support if the budget bill is to win Senate approval. ####  ##### “The more senators on board, the better it will be,” said Steve Wojick, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. ####  ##### Still, excise tax repeal supporters say they are not giving up. ####  ##### “We will continue to campaign to get support for repealing the tax,” Ms. Fildes said. ####  ##### The impact of the excise tax will be widespread, surveys have found. ####  ##### A recent analysis by benefit consultant Towers Watson & Co. projected that 48% of employers with at least 5,000 employees that offer health plans will be hit by the tax that offer health plans could be hit by the excise tax in 2018, with 82% affected by 2023. Other surveys found that a smaller number, though still a substantial percentage, of employers would be affected by the tax. ####  ##### Among other things, business groups say the tax is unfair because its application would not recognize wide geographic differences in health care costs. ####  ##### In addition, the IRS has yet to propose regulations that would aid employers in complying with the tax. #### "
"Walgreens' Rite Aid acquisition includes pharmacy benefit management unit";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. will acquire rival drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp., a deal which includes Rite Aid's small pharmacy benefit management subsidiary and marks the latest development in a movement to consolidate U.S. PBM businesses. ####  ##### Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens announced late Tuesday it will acquire Rite Aid for $17.2 billion in cash and acquired debt. ####  ##### The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said during a conference call Wednesday with investment analysts. ####  ##### “This combination will further strengthen our commitment to making quality healthcare accessible to more customers and patients. Our complementary retail pharmacy footprints in the U.S. will create an even better network, with more health and wellness solutions available in stores and online,” Mr. Pessina said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### It is unclear how Rite Aid's PBM, Envision Pharmaceutical Services, which it acquired in June, will fit into Walgreens' strategy, and a Walgreens spokesman declined to comment. ####  ##### During Wednesday's conference call, Alex Gourlay, president of Walgreen Co., labeled Envision “an important but relatively small PBM business” that will “help us understand access in America better” and “create a market which is affordable.” ####  ##### “We think this could be a way into that in terms of Envision,” Mr. Gourlay said. ####  ##### Mr. Pessina added the PBM will provide “a good opportunity to learn.” ####  ##### Walgreens previously exited the pharmacy benefits space in 2011 when it sold its PBM unit to Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. ####  ##### And more recently, Mr. Pessina in April told Forbes that buying a PBM is “not necessarily the best model for the future” and said it was an unlikely step for Walgreens. ####  ##### But a string of recent deals have led to PBM consolidation, which provides those businesses with more mass and bargaining power to negotiate with drug makers over drug prices. For example, Optum Inc., a unit of United HealthCare Services Inc., in July bought rival Catamaran Corp., a PBM based in Schaumburg, Illinois. ####  ##### Additionally, CVS Health Corp. in August acquired pharmacy services provider Omnicare Inc., and in June bought the pharmacy stores and medical clinic of Target Stores Inc. #### "

The center provides primary health care, physical medicine, behavioral health, vision services and health coaching to employees of Intuit Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other large technology companies, according to a statement from Towers Watson and Crossover Health. ####  ##### “Drawing from our proven experience with onsite centers for large employers, we have followed the growing interest from smaller employers that sought a similar offering but did not have enough employees or real estate to offer an onsite health center themselves,” Dr. Scott Shreeve, CEO of Crossover Health, said in the statement. “The near-site concept is designed to solve this dilemma by allowing employers to pool resources and offer their employees a remarkable, patient-driven health experience that delivers lower costs and increases quality.” ####  ##### The companies plan to open several other near-site health centers in Northern California in 2016. ####  ##### “Employers welcome cost-effective and innovative solutions that keep employees healthy and productive, and the near-site option opens the opportunity for more employers to access this attractive offering,” said Andrew Halpert, a San Francisco-based senior health care management consultant at Towers Watson, which is providing implementation support, quality oversight and performance measurement through its partnership with Crossover Health. #### "
"County joins public employers ditching domestic partner benefits";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Orange County, Florida, this week joined a growing list of public sector employers phasing out health care coverage and other benefits for domestic partners. ####  ##### County commissioners in Orlando voted unanimously on Tuesday to discontinue Orange County's domestic partner benefit program effective Jan. 1, 2016, with a one-year grace period ending Dec. 31 of next year for current enrollees in the program. ####  ##### Orange County, which covers roughly 900 square miles of central Florida and employs approximately 10,400 workers, began offering spousal-equivalent health care, retirement and other benefits to gay and lesbian employees' domestic partners in 2012, since same-sex marriages were not recognized under federal or Florida state law. ####  ##### In an Oct. 7 memo to the board of commissioners, Orange County Human Resources Director J. Ricardo Daye said the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in 2013 and in June of this year striking down federal and state bans on same-sex marriage “nullified” the need to offer benefits to same-sex domestic partners. ####  ##### “The intent of the program was to ensure parity for same-sex couples who did not have the option to marry in the state of Florida,” Mr. Daye said in the memo. “The program was not available to opposite-sex couples because they have always had the right to marry.” ####  ##### The county's board of commissioners also voted 7-0 to remove same-sex domestic partners from eligibility for bereavement leave, effective Dec. 31, 2016. ####  ##### “By eliminating domestic partner benefits, Orange County is taking a significant step backwards,” Stratton Pollitzer, deputy director of the St. Petersburg, Florida-based LGBT rights group Equality Florida Action Inc., said in a statement following the board of commissioners' vote. ####  ##### “Numerous studies also show that providing the option of domestic partner benefits is good for business,” Mr. Pollitzer said. “The costs are extremely low, averaging only about one percent of total benefits costs, and providing the benefits creates a significant, measurable increase in employee morale and productivity that more than makes up the expense.” ####  ##### Several other public sector employers have elected to drop domestic partners from their employee benefit programs in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which declared state laws banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional. ####  ##### Earlier this month, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that federal employees will no longer be able to offer dependent health, dental and vision coverage to their same-sex domestic partners' children as of the end of the 2015 plan year. ####  ##### Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University and the University System of Georgia — which comprises more than 30 public colleges across the state — all discontinued domestic partner benefits within the last few months, as have the cities of Charlotte, North Carolina and Cleveland, Ohio. ####  ##### According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 34% of gay and lesbian employees in the public sector had access to domestic partner health benefits in 2014, and 50% of those employees' domestic partners were eligible for survivor benefits under their partner's pension plan. #### "

"Health insurance satisfaction declines: Survey ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Health Insurers";" ##### People in group health plans are more dissatisfied with their employer-provided health coverage than consumers in general, and customer satisfaction with health insurance has reached its lowest level in a decade, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. ####  ##### Health insurance now ranks the fifth-lowest of industries ranked in the study that began in 1994 as a joint effort of the University of Michigan and American Society for Quality. Only fixed-line telephone service, the U.S. Postal Service, subscription television services and Internet service providers rank lower, according to the survey released Monday. ####  ##### High premiums, deductibles and copayments as well as slow processing are some reasons customer satisfaction has declined to a score of 69 for health insurance customers overall and 68 for those with group health coverage. Both groups' opinions do improve, however, if they have more than one type of coverage from which to choose, according to the study. ####  ##### “The health insurance industry is in the midst of merger mania among large insurers that could tighten the field if the federal government grants approval: Humana-Aetna and Anthem-Cigna.

"U.S. drug benefit managers clamp down on specialty pharmacies";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, UnitedHealth Group";" ##### (Reuters) — In recent days, the largest U.S. managers of private prescription drug benefits have cut off at least eight pharmacies that work closely with drugmakers, intensifying scrutiny of a system that helps inflate drug prices, officials at the pharmacy benefit managers told Reuters. ####  ##### The terminations come from payers who together manage drug benefits for more than 100 million Americans, and they follow disclosures by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in late October that one pharmacy accounted for about 7% of its sales. ####  ##### ""What we had not been aware of, until really the last year, was these type of pharmacies that have a really high proportion of sales from a drugmaker and it was not out in the open,"" Everett Neville, senior vice president of supply chain at Express Scripts Holding Co., said in an interview. ####  ##### The actions are being felt by drugmakers that have come to rely on hefty price hikes to boost profits. Valeant's closely-linked pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services L.L.C., pressed insurers to pay for expensive Valeant treatments even though much cheaper generic alternatives were available. ####  ##### Shares of Valeant have lost more than half their value since its pharmacy ties were made public. ####  ##### Mr. Neville said Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager, has changed the algorithms it uses in its audits to find pharmacies focused heavily on one drug manufacturer and has cut ties with half a dozen such pharmacies in the past week. ####  ##### Express Scripts and OptumRx Inc., part of UnitedHealth Group Inc., have also found pharmacies engaged in extensive mail-order operations without proper accreditation. CVS Health Corp., the No. 2 pharmacy benefits manager, said in an email that it had reviewed pharmacies with ties to drug manufacturers and was removing those that fell short of its contract. It did not give further details. ####  ##### All three of the big benefits managers have quit doing business with Philidor. Mr. Neville at Express Scripts was careful to note that the pharmacies being eliminated are not true ""specialty"" pharmacies that help manage drugs for rare diseases. ####  ##### ""The Valeant-Philidor relationship woke payers up to potential problems in their pharmacy networks,"" said Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, which follows the drug distribution industry. ""We are now seeing much greater scrutiny of the independent pharmacies that may not be complying with payer requirements."" ####  ##### Growth from price hikes ####  ##### For large pharmaceutical companies, U.S. pricing gains have accounted for roughly 46% of worldwide revenue growth over the past three years, according to Sector & Sovereign analyst Richard Evans. ####  ##### U.S. drug prices rose an estimated 12% to 13% last year, and consumers are being asked to pay more of the total cost as health insurance deductibles and copayments increase. ####  ##### ""Drug cost has been the single biggest driver of health care spend over the last two years. It wasn't prior to that,"" said Dr. John Bennett, CEO at Capital District Physicians' Health Plan, a nonprofit based in Albany, New York. ####  ##### Certain pharmacies have contributed to higher drug prices by driving customers to expensive treatments instead of cheaper generics, pharmacy benefit managers say. Many help drugmakers to cover the out-of-pocket costs for consumers, lightening their load but leaving health insurers to pay the rest. ####  ##### Independent pharmacies and their drugmaker partners counter that Express Scripts, CVS and OptumRx together control more than two-thirds of the market through their own mail-order operations. The specialty pharmacies say that the benefit managers are trying to curb the explosive growth of smaller, independent players. ####  ##### ""Our philosophy of ensuring that patients get the medicine their doctors prescribe is threatening Express Scripts' profiteering and exposing what we believe is a lack of care for patients and respect for physicians,"" Horizon Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Timothy Walbert said last week. ####  ##### Express Scripts has cut reimbursement to Linden Care Pharmacy, a New York-based pharmacy that distributed Horizon drugs. ####  ##### A booming business ####  ##### Specialty pharmacies were first formed in the 1970s to deliver products requiring special handling to doctors' offices and hospitals, including therapies for cancer, HIV/AIDS or hemophilia. The field has evolved to include mail-order operations that offer services for complex, high-cost drugs, often for rare or chronic diseases. ####  ##### The growth of such pharmacies has been fueled by a record number of specialty treatments coming to market for everything from hepatitis C to cystic fibrosis. Pembroke Consulting estimated that the number of accredited specialty pharmacies would jump by nearly 100 to a total of 250 in 2015. ####  ##### Diplomat Pharmacy Inc., the nation's largest independent specialty pharmacy, is the sole distributor of three medications for very small patient populations: Exelixis Inc.'s thyroid cancer drug Cometriq, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' leukemia drug Synribo, and Keveyis, a treatment for temporary paralysis made by Taro Pharmaceuticals. ####  ##### ""We handle drugs for complex, chronic conditions. Many were previously a death sentence,"" said Sean Whelan, chief financial officer. Net income at Diplomat, which went public in 2014, nearly tripled in the first nine months of this year from the same period a year ago. ####  ##### But the Philidor example shows how some pharmacies are being used to dispense more ordinary, and expensive, prescriptions. Philidor was selling Jublia, a toenail fungus treatment that retails for about $500 for a small bottle. The treatment is only moderately effective: It cured about 18% of patients in one clinical trial after one year. ####  ##### Linden Care was selling Duexis, Horizon's top drug, which combines the common pain killer ibuprofen and famotidine, the generic version of heartburn drug Pepcid. It costs about $500 for a 30-day supply. ####  ##### Valeant has denied allegations that it used Philidor to inflate revenue, but is in the process of cutting its distribution arrangements with the pharmacy. Philidor, which will soon shut down, insists its employees behaved ethically. ####  ##### This week, Linden Care Pharmacy sued Express Scripts, while New York City-based Irmat Pharmacy sued OptumRx for moving to terminate their contracts. ####  ##### At Irmat, 60% of the prescriptions being sent to OptumRx for payment were from two drugmakers, a source familiar with the situation said. Irmat said in its lawsuit that revenue skyrocketed after it contracted in 2013 with Nestle S.A.'s Galderma S.A., and Aqua Pharmaceuticals, part of Spain's Almirall. Neither company was immediately available for comment. ####  ##### Eileen Wood, chief pharmacy officer at CDPHP, said the health plan rejected 4,700 claims from Philidor and related pharmacies this year, nearly all of which were for Valeant products. CDPHP works with CVS for pharmacy benefits. ####  ##### Ms. Wood also called ""very suspicious"" the 477 claims CDPHP received from Linden Care this year, noting that 90% were for drugs from Horizon or its subsidiaries. All were rejected. ####  ##### Officials at Linden Care did not respond to requests for comment. #### "
" Pharmacy sues OptumRX over removal from its network";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — Specialty pharmacy Park Irmat Drug Corp. is suing OptumRx, saying the pharmacy benefit unit of UnitedHealth Group plans to remove Irmat from its network as of the end of the month. ####  ##### In the suit, filed late on Thursday in New York Supreme Court, Irmat said it received notice that it will be cut off from reimbursement by OptumRx, which operates a mail-order pharmacy that competes with Irmat, particularly for medicines that treat dermatological ailments. ####  ##### Irmat is the latest specialty, mail-order pharmacy to be dropped by a payer after drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc was accused of using its close ties with Philidor Rx Services to improperly inflate revenue. Valeant has denied the allegations and cut ties with Philidor, prompting other payers to follow suit. ####  ##### OptumRx did not have an immediate comment on the lawsuit. ####  ##### Several pharmacy benefit managers, including OptumRx, have removed Philidor from their networks and said they are evaluating other specialty pharmacies. ####  ##### Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, has cut Linden Care pharmacy from its network, citing close ties with drugmaker Horizon Pharma LLC. ####  ##### Irmat is seeking an injunction barring Optum from terminating or excluding it. Irmat said it was in danger of going out of business as the result of Optum's action. ####  ##### Irmat's mail-order business has been an unmitigated success. From 2012 to 2015, the pharmacy's business grew exponentially, both in revenue and geographic scope. ####  ##### By way of example, Irmat's revenue from Optum members increased from approximately $1.99 million in 2012, to $3.8 million in 2013, to $15.3 million in 2014, and was projected to grow to $33 million in 2015. ####  ##### In its lawsuit, Irmat says it began in 2013 to participate in programs sponsored by drugmakers Galderma SA and Aqua Pharmaceuticals under which the manufacturers covered patient co-payments on leading dermatological drugs. ####  ##### Galderma is owned by Nestle SA. Aqua is owned by Almirall SA #### "

"Firm offers pharmacy benefit manager analysis for self-insured employers ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Technology, TPA";" ##### Benefit administration firm SKYGEN USA on Tuesday launched a data analytics company, Hylis Pharmacy Solutions, which aims to save self-insured employers costs associated with nontransparent pharmacy benefit contracts. ####  ##### By analyzing past claims data, Mequon, Wisconsin-based Hylis provides self-insured employers with the actual cost of delivering pharmacy benefits to their members, looks for reasons the employer may be paying too much, and offers recommendations on how to help reduce and control group prescription drug benefit costs, according to a company statement released Tuesday. ####  ##### The firm claims to be able to deliver between 15% and 25% savings, Hylis said in the statement. ####  ##### PBMs administer prescription drug programs for employers and negotiate with pharmacies to achieve better pricing, Hylis said. They also often work to reduce the cost of group prescription drug programs by developing formularies and encouraging the use of generic drugs over brand name pharmaceuticals, Hylis said. ####  ##### But there is often a lack of transparency in how PBMs make their money, according to the statement. For example, some PBMs engage in spread pricing, meaning they pay pharmacies one amount to dispense the prescriptions, but bill plan sponsors at a greater margin and pocket the difference, Hylis said. ####  ##### Hylis will perform an analysis of a plan sponsor's prescription drug spending for free, and will charge a percentage of the realized savings if changes need to be made to the pharmacy benefit program, according to the statement. ####  ##### Hylis said it will continue to validate the data on an ongoing basis to ensure savings are maintained. ####  ##### “While the industry is focused on savings, the complexity of the transactions and the lack of transparency make it difficult for plan sponsors to determine whether those savings are being maximized,” Hylis CEO Greg Borca said in the statement. “Hylis Pharmacy Solutions can pull back the veil and deliver real insight to help most plan sponsors save anywhere from 15 to 25 percent on their costs.” #### "
"Health insurer hammers out risk-based deal for costly anti-cholesterol drug discount";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs";" ##### Health insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has struck a deal with drugmaker Amgen for its new cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha. ####  ##### In addition to providing a discount, Amgen will be at risk financially if health plan members' cholesterol levels aren't lowered enough. ####  ##### Insurers and pharmacy benefit management companies have aggressively pursued discount negotiations with drugmakers to stem the tide of rising drug costs, and Harvard Pilgrim's deal with Amgen is one of the first to add a pay-for-performance element on top of the discount. But it's uncertain if this tactic will catch on, or if it will do anything to curtail high drug pricing. ####  ##### “The pharmaceutical segment has remained primarily in a traditional 'pay-for-pill' model,” Harvard Pilgrim Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Sherman said. With the latest deal, Amgen is “putting their money where their mouth is,” he said. ####  ##### The retail price of a year's supply of Repatha costs $14,100, slightly less than the $14,600 price tag of Praluent, the other major cholesterol drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration this past summer. Harvard Pilgrim did not negotiate any agreement for Praluent, which means Repatha will be on its preferred formulary. Express Scripts Holding Co., a PBM, said last month it would cover prescriptions for both Praluent and Repatha. ####  ##### Sherman declined to say how much the price was reduced. All contracts with pharmaceutical companies have confidentiality clauses that prohibit those terms from being disclosed, but Sherman said the discount was “material.” ####  ##### Amgen executives recently told investors that they would not disclose discounts given to third-party payers. For the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs made by Gilead Sciences, the average discounts were around 50% of the sticker price, but the drugs still cost more than $40,000 for a course of treatment, raising questions of whether discount negotiations broadly help the system. ####  ##### A report this year from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said the new class of cholesterol drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors that go after a person's “bad” cholesterol, are extremely overpriced. Based on cost-effectiveness measures, those drugs should cost $2,520 per year, the group said. ####  ##### Unique to the deal is that Amgen will have to provide larger rebates to Harvard Pilgrim if patients' low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are not lowered to “what was observed during clinical trials.” Harvard Pilgrim can also receive additional rebates if the drug is used more than a predetermined amount, which essentially lowers costs on a per-prescription basis. The insurer said it still wants to encourage patients to use lower-cost statins. ####  ##### Insurers have experimented with risk-sharing with drug companies in the past. Cigna Corp. did it with Merck & Co.'s diabetes medications, and Health Alliance Medical Plans, owned by Urbana, Ill.-based health system Carle Foundation, created a value-based deal for the osteoporosis drug Actonel. Sherman said he believes conversations about value-based contracting for prescription drugs will become more commonplace. ####  ##### “We hope that the pharma companies will finally start to realize this is the right way to align with the healthcare delivery and financing system,” Sherman said. ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"FSA rollover to retirement plan proposal introduced  ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### Employees would be allowed to transfer unused amounts of up to $250 a year from their flexible spending accounts to retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, under legislation introduced in the House of Representatives last week. ####  ##### Under the measure, H.R. 4067, introduced by Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., employees could shift unused FSA funds — $250 or the account balance, whichever is less — to a retirement plan. ####  ##### Under 2013 IRS regulations, employees can, if their employers offer such a feature, automatically carry over up to $500 in their FSA accounts to the next year to pay medical expenses. ####  ##### That approach is an alternative to one the IRS authorized in 2005. Under that so-called “grace period” approach, FSA participants can roll over their full unused balance remaining at the end of a plan year. However, the balance must be used by the end of the first 2 1/2 months of the following plan year or be forfeited. #### "
"Company doctoring: More employers offer on-site clinics";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Laitram Machinery Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of shrimp-peeling machines, sits along the Mississippi River under the Huey P. Long Bridge, just outside of New Orleans — a suitable location for a company associated with a food product that's central to southern Louisiana's celebrated Creole and Cajun cuisine. ####  ##### But there's a health downside to that rich culture. “In New Orleans, you can find ways to not eat well and not drink well,” said Franck LaBiche, the company's human resources director. ####  ##### Letting les bons temps rouler wasn't just bad for the company's workers. It also was rough on its finances. “We were looking at a monthly health care premium curve for employees that showed a 40% increase over six years,” said Mr. LaBiche, whose company has a self-insured health plan. ####  ##### In 2012, Laitram joined a growing list of large U.S. employers that have opened on-site health clinics in an effort to control the rising costs of their health benefit programs. Nearly 30% of companies with more than 5,000 workers now have on-site or near-site clinics offering some type of primary care, up from 24% in 2013, according to a survey this year by benefits consultant Mercer L.L.C. In addition to serving employees, some clinics also treat workers' families. Many of these facilities include fitness centers with exercise equipment. These services often are provided without charge to employees. ####  ##### This has produced a growth market for companies that operate clinics for employers, including Healthstat Inc., Marathon Health, Premise Health Holding Corp. and QuadMed L.L.C. Health systems also have jumped into the market, operating about 18% of worksite clinics, according to benefits consultant Towers Watson & Co., which surveyed firms with clinics this year. Downers Grove, Illinois-based Advocate Medical Group has a division called Advocate at Work that operates worksite clinics for about 120 companies, including financial services firm Northern Trust Corp. and the Chicago Tribune. ####  ##### “Being the largest integrated delivery system in the area, it was a natural fit for us to figure out how to leverage our expertise for the benefit of these companies,” said Dr. Prentiss Taylor Jr., Advocate At Work's corporate medical director. ####  ##### According to Towers Watson, 64% of employers with an on-site clinic contract the work to a vendor, while 23% are operated directly by the employer. ####  ##### Employers say these clinics provide primary and preventive care, and encourage exercise, thus keeping workers healthier, reducing absenteeism and cutting benefit costs. They say the on-site centers reduce the amount of time workers spend away from work visiting off-site health care providers. In addition, the centers can help companies identify occupational health and safety risks, such as poorly designed workstations that result in back and neck problems. ####  ##### Because they believe in the cost-saving potential of on-site clinics, many employers plan to continue investing in them even though the cost will likely be included in calculating the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax on high-value health plans starting in 2018. Earlier this year, the Internal Revenue Service said spending on on-site clinics would be considered in the tax calculation unless the clinics offered only “de minimis” care. ####  ##### Two-thirds of large employers with on-site health facilities say they plan to expand such facilities, according to the Towers Watson survey. “That's validation of their belief that the clinics are reducing cost,” said Allan Khoury, senior health management consultant at Towers Watson. ####  ##### But Vivian Ho, a Baylor University health economist, questioned whether these clinics will yield significant cost savings. The employees most likely to use the clinics are those who already are the most health conscious, while the unhealthiest and most expensive employees will still be unlikely to get needed preventive care, she said. Beyond that, the payoff from preventive medicine often comes years later, perhaps after the employees have left the company. ####  ##### In addition, she said employees may be reluctant to use workplace clinics because of concerns about privacy. Many employees already fear their employers will use their health information against them. “I think these are legitimate worries,” she said. ####  ##### Workplace clinics are actually an old concept. Decades ago, some industries with high occupational injury rates employed company doctors and nurses to treat workers. Kaiser Permanente grew out of employer-sponsored clinics to provide care for workers in shipyards and steel mills before World War II. ####  ##### In more recent years, rising costs have prompted employers to look beyond traditional occupational health to offer broader primary care for office and industrial workers, said Larry Boress, executive director of the National Association of Worksite Health Centers and CEO of the Midwest Business Group on Health. ####  ##### These newer employer-sponsored clinics typically have nurse practitioners or physician assistants on staff, though some also have full-time or part-time physicians. Some feature specialty providers such as physical therapists and nutritionists. About half offer pharmacy service. The on-site health clinic at Facebook Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California, has a chiropractor. Many also include fitness centers. ####  ##### The scope of services offered varies, with most offering at least urgent care but many providing broader services. Many offer flu shots, and some can even take X-rays. Some offer healthy cooking classes. United Airlines, which has clinics for its employees at airports in Chicago, Houston and Newark, has doctors and physical therapists at each, in addition to nurse practitioners and physician assistants. ####  ##### For some employees, the on-site clinics may provide their only regular health care. For workers who do have a regular provider, employers want the workplace clinic to complement rather than replace those providers. At Laitram, for example, employees can sign a consent form allowing the on-site clinic to share medical records with outside clinicians. ####  ##### One concern for employers opening on-site clinics, particularly in smaller communities, is upsetting independent physicians and other providers in the community who may worry about losing patients to worksite providers. But Mr. Boress said 40% to 60% of people who go to on-site clinics don't have a personal doctor. Laitram's Mr. LaBiche said that the company clinic sometimes sends patients to a local health system with which it has an agreement, and that the system may end up getting more patients. ####  ##### Some clinics, such as Laitram's, provide services without charge to employees covered by the company's health plan. Those who aren't covered pay a fee. Sometimes the fitness centers also are free, though some charge a small membership fee on the belief that people who pay for a gym membership are more likely to use it. ####  ##### Mr. LaBiche said the company's health clinic, operated by Winooski, Vermont-based Marathon Health, and its fitness and nutrition center, run by LifeStart Wellness Network, are improving employee health and reducing the company's health benefit costs. Employee visits to hospital emergency rooms have dropped 26% since 2010, and nearly 8 in 10 workers have seen improvement on at least one measure of health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol or body fat percentage, he said. The company's health benefit costs were flat between 2012 and 2014, though they increased about 5% this year. ####  ##### Still, there's not much hard data on return on investment for employers, aside from anecdotal information from companies such as Laitram. Towers Watson's survey found that more employers are now measuring ROI, though only 12% have commissioned independent analyses. Mr. Khoury said the ACA's Cadillac tax will force employers to take a harder financial look at the clinics. “The excise tax will put a lot of focus on whether they actually are reducing cost,” he said. ####  ##### Advocates of workplace clinics say they can be useful in improving occupational health and safety for a company's workforce. If a significant number of workers are reporting back and neck pain, the company can conduct an ergonomics assessment of employees' desk and seating arrangements and make modifications, said Daniel Lord, a chiropractor who heads physical medicine at Facebook's health center. ####  ##### United Airlines uses data on the types of injuries the clinics are treating to spot trends and improve its safety training. “We can see what body parts to focus on out on the ramp,” said Terry Werber, the airline's manager for the on-site clinics. ####  ##### More than a dozen companies have started worksite clinics for employers. Marathon Health now operates 140 on-site clinics in 38 states. Another large firm in this niche is Brentwood, Tennessee-based Premise Health, created last year by the merger of Walgreens' Take Care Employer Solutions division and CHS Health Services. It operates more than 500 on-site health clinics, pharmacies and fitness centers in 46 states. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Healthstat has more than 300 facilities in 32 states. Another company, Sussex, Wisconsin-based QuadMed, runs more than 100 clinics in 20 states. ####  ##### Hospitals and health systems have taken notice of the industry's growth and have launched initiatives. Advocate Medical Group's Advocate at Work operates worksite clinics for about 120 companies, and serves the 32,000 employees of its parent company, Advocate Health Care. Mr. Taylor said being part of a large health system such as Advocate extends the value of the clinic, because it can help patients navigate the broader health care maze, including specialist referrals. “We interact with the entire health care system for the benefit of the employee,” he said. ####  ##### One worker who attests to the value of an on-site clinic is Gregg Schenck, an information technology developer at Laitram. He said having the health care providers and fitness and nutrition specialists at his workplace and getting to know them made it easier for him to seek care. ####  ##### Mr. Schenck weighed 350 pounds when he went in for a health consultation and a weight-loss program. He worked with staff at the fitness center, which he started using regularly since it was so convenient. He was motivated by the support of co-workers, who praised his progress as he lost 110 pounds. ####  ##### “The doctor has taken me off the diabetes medication, the acid reflux has gone away, and my blood pressure has come down,” Mr. Schenck said. “I really see it as a saving grace.” ####  ##### David Royse writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Two-year 'Cadillac' tax delay may signal repeal later";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### Congressional leaders have unveiled a $1.1 trillion budget deal that would delay the controversial “Cadillac” tax by two years — a major win for business groups and employers that have called for its repeal. ####  ##### The spending deal unveiled late Tuesday would push the start date of the excise tax from the current 2018 to 2020. ####  ##### For many, that is a sign that a full repeal is on its way. ####  ##### The “Cadillac” tax imposed by the health care reform law would impose a 40% excise tax on the part of group health plan premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. ####  ##### “We see the two-year delay as a down payment on a full repeal,” said Katy Spangler, Washington-based senior vice president of health policy at the American Benefits Council, which has called for the tax's repeal on behalf of hundreds of large employers it represents. ####  ##### According to the council, the excise tax would increase employer costs and reduce access to care. ####  ##### “It gives Congress and the administration more time to work on the repeal and evaluate the potentially negative consequences of the tax,” said Steve Wojcik, Washington-based vice president of policy at the National Business Group on Health, which he said applauds the delay. ####  ##### The two-year postponement also “really clouds the outlook for implementation of the tax,” said Geoffrey Manville, principal of government relations at Mercer L.L.C. in Washington. ####  ##### He said the decision will likely “fall to the next Congress and the next president.” The odds of a repeal of the excise tax are “better than even.” ####  ##### The two-year delay also gives employers time to figure out how to reduce their health plan costs to avoid triggering the tax, he said. ####  ##### According to an NBGH survey of 140 of the largest U.S. corporations taken before the latest congressional action, 48% of employers expect at least one of their benefit plans to hit the excise tax in 2018 if they don't take measures to control rising health care costs. By 2020, 72% expect one of their plans to trigger the tax. ####  ##### The $1.1 trillion budget deal still needs to be approved by Congress, but the White House has signaled it will not veto the deal over a two-year Cadillac tax delay, Washington newspaper The Hill reported. ####  ##### Also included in the budget package is a moratorium on the health reform law's medical device tax for 2016 and 2017. That tax went into effect in 2013. ####  ##### The congressional proposal also would have the U.S. comptroller general and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners study whether the reform law uses “suitable” benchmarks to determine whether the tax should be adjusted to reflect age and gender factors in setting the excise tax thresholds. ####  ##### The claims data of the benchmark the law now uses — Blue Cross Blue Shield's standard benefit option under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program — has been criticized as an inaccurate representation of the national workforce. #### "
"Hospitals launch specialty pharmacies to curb drug costs";"Benefits Management";"Prescription Drug Benefits";" ##### With specialty drug spending soaring 60% in the past five years, large health systems have jumped into the specialty pharmacy business to assert some control over those costs by dispensing the drugs to their patients and covered employees. ####  ##### Health systems say those pharmacies help them better manage outpatient drug costs. A growing number of insurance contracts and Medicare initiatives tie payments to quality metrics that reach beyond hospital stays to hold providers accountable for patients' total medical costs, including drugs. ####  ##### It's also a robust business for those systems that can successfully negotiate with manufacturers and health plans so they can compete with the bigger players. ####  ##### “It you want us to be responsible for the total cost of care, allow us to be able to care comprehensively for these patients,” said Dick Schirber, a spokesman for ExceleraRx Corp., a for-profit specialty pharmacy services company owned by six health systems. Comprehensive care, Mr. Schirber said, includes managing the very expensive prescriptions that patients take at home for cancer or chronic diseases, so that providers have more control over waste as well as complications. ####  ##### ExceleraRx provides services to system-owned specialty pharmacies, such as negotiating with drugmakers and handling data reporting. ####  ##### Phoenix-based Banner Health started its own specialty pharmacy last year, taking its business away from Premier Inc., which acquired Commcare Specialty Pharmacy in 2010 for $35.9 million. Banner employees enrolled in the system's health plan were the pharmacy's first customers. ####  ##### “For everyone, everywhere, the pharmacy expense is increasing,” said Pam Nenaber, Banner's CEO of pharmaceutical operations. ####  ##### Banner Health hired three clinical pharmacists, three patient advocates and three staff members to support operations. The system also spent $1 million on a drug-dispensing robot for the specialty pharmacy's new home-delivery service. The robot fills pill bottles, which are verified by a pharmacist before being shipped. Clinical pharmacists also talk to patients at home to answer prescription questions. ####  ##### In the first year, Banner shaved about 1% off its specialty drug spending for about 1,200 workers and their families covered by the system's employee health plan. ####  ##### Health systems that own specialty pharmacies argue they can do a better job overseeing the use of the drugs they dispense. That's because their pharmacies can easily access medical records, laboratory results and physician notes, allowing pharmacists to closely monitor the effectiveness of the drugs prescribed and react quickly when something goes wrong or patients need help. ####  ##### “They know if the patient is getting the value for the high-cost drug,” said Steven Rough, director of pharmacy for the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, which began handling transplant drugs in 2006 and expanded its specialty pharmacy in 2011. ####  ##### Launching a specialty pharmacy does not require significant capital investment, and the high prices of the drugs — even sold at slim margins — make it possible to quickly see a return on that investment. ####  ##### “It's a quite viable business,” said Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic, which opened its specialty pharmacy roughly a year ago, and advises other systems to do the same. “Get on it and get on it fast,” he said. ####  ##### The Cleveland Clinic estimates it will recoup its upfront investment from the specialty pharmacy's profits within 16 months of opening. ####  ##### That's true even as the Ohio health system expands its operations. The pharmacy is hiring more staff because the volume of prescriptions has increased about 10% a month. It now employs 25 workers, and that number is expected to reach 66 employees within three years. ####  ##### New drugs last year boosted spending for specialty pharmaceuticals 25% over the prior year, IMS Health Inc. reported in April. Specialty drugs to treat diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C now account for one-third of drug spending. Sovaldi and other new treatments for hepatitis C boosted spending by $12.3 billion, IMS said. ####  ##### Specialty drug spending ####  ##### Pharmaceuticals still account for just 10% of U.S. health care spending, but a 12.3% surge in 2014 — including $12.6 billion spent on new specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C — contributed to the year's uptick from the record-slow health spending that started with the Great Recession. ####  ##### That growth makes dispensing specialty drugs an increasingly important piece of health care delivery, as well as an attractive business line, said John Ransom, a managing director of health care research at Raymond James Financial Inc. “It's riding the wave of where the innovation is,” he said. ####  ##### But systems will face fierce competition as they try to ride that wave, Mr. Ransom said. “It can be a tough business.” ####  ##### They will have to vie with national pharmacies like CVS Health Corp., Express Scripts Holding Co. and Diplomat Pharmacy Inc. to be included in health insurance networks. CVS and Express Scripts also own pharmacy benefit-management companies, so they “have a vested interest in limiting the network of specialty pharmacies because they are specialty pharmacies,” Mr. Ransom said. ####  ##### Pharmaceutical manufacturers also limit shipping of some of their drugs to a handful of pharmacies, in what are called limited-distribution networks. ####  ##### Getting a spot in drug manufacturers' limited networks requires intense negotiation, and the capacity to report quality and use data back to drugmakers. ####  ##### ExceleraRx, launched in 2012 with investment from Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services, helps its owners and clients with those tasks. Englewood, Colorado-based Catholic Health Initiatives, which opened its own specialty pharmacies in Kentucky and Nebraska last year, invested in ExceleraRx to “supercharge” the new business line, said Nick Barto, the health system's senior vice president for capital finance. ####  ##### However, another danger for providers is that patients may begin to see them as “the organization that's providing the drugs that you can't afford,” said Benjamin Isgur, director of thought leadership at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P.' Health Research Institute. ####  ##### But health system executives say they've hired staff to help patients identify discounts, coupons and other financial aid for drug costs not covered by insurance. And health systems can further market their independence from shareholders and the pharmaceutical industry. ####  ##### Melanie Evans writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Walgreens' Rite Aid acquisition attracts antitrust scrutiny";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Regulation, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### Antitrust regulators are taking a hard look at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s proposed $17.2 billion acquisition of rival drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp. ####  ##### Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based Rite Aid, which agreed to be acquired by Walgreens in late October, each received a second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission, the companies said Friday in a joint statement. ####  ##### According to the FTC, a second request is issued when the agency needs more information to assess the deal, such as data on the likely effects of the merger, the companies' products and services, and market conditions where each company does business. ####  ##### Both companies said they have been cooperating with the FTC, and still expect the deal to close in the second half of 2016, according to the statement. ####  ##### The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would create the largest pharmacy chain in the U.S. with about 13,000 stores, easily trumping the second largest U.S. pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp., which has about 7,900 stores. ####  ##### The deal also includes Rite Aid's small pharmacy benefit manager Envision Pharmaceutical Services, giving Walgreens a second shot at the PBM game, should the firm decide to invest in Envision. Walgreens previously exited the PBM space in 2011 when it sold its PBM unit to Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. ####  ##### In addition to securing FTC approval, the Walgreens-Rite Aid transaction still needs approval from Rite Aid's stockholders. #### "

"Supreme Court rejects new challenge to health care reform law";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### (Reuters) — The U.S. Supreme Court, which delivered major rulings in 2012 and 2015 preserving President Barack Obama's signature health care law, on Tuesday declined to take up a new, long-shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by an Iowa artist. ####  ##### The court turned away an appeal by Matt Sissel, who had asserted that the 2010 Affordable Care Act violated the U.S. Constitution's requirement that revenue-raising legislation must originate in the House of Representatives, not in the Senate, as the health care law did. ####  ##### The high court left in place a 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholding a lower court's dismissal of the lawsuit, which was backed by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group. The suit targeted the law's ""individual mandate"" that Americans obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty. ####  ##### In a 6-3 ruling last June, the Supreme Court rejected a conservative legal challenge and upheld nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the health care law. In 2012, the justices ruled 5-4 that the law's requirement that Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty was authorized by the power of Congress to levy taxes. ####  ##### A three-judge appeals court panel was unanimous in finding that Mr. Sissel's interpretation of the law was at odds with U.S. Supreme Court precedents, including the high court's ruling in 2012. The court found that the penalty for not obtaining insurance was a form of taxation. ####  ##### The law was passed by President Obama's fellow Democrats in Congress in 2010 over the unified opposition of Republicans, and conservatives who call the measure a government overreach have fought it since its inception. The landmark law was designed to provide health care for millions of uninsured Americans. ####  ##### President Obama this month vetoed legislation passed by the Republican-led Congress that would have dismantled the law. ####  ##### In the spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case brought by religious groups seeking an exemption from a provision of the law that requires them to provide contraception coverage in their health insurance policies. ####  ##### The case is Sissel v. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 15-543. #### "
"Ford pension plan funding improves globally, but U.S. plans lag";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### Ford Motor Co. on Thursday said the funded status of its pension plans significantly improved in 2015 due to strong investment returns racked up by the automaker’s pension plans outside the United States. ####  ##### At year-end 2015, Ford’s pension plans worldwide were underfunded by $8.2 billion, down sharply from $9.8 billion a year earlier, according to financial reports released by Ford. ####  ##### Ford’s pension plans outside the United States were underfunded by $4.5 billion in 2015, down sharply from $7.5 billion in 2014. That steep decline in underfunding was largely due to a 7.7% return on plan assets. ####  ##### By contrast, underfunding of Ford’s U.S. pension plans jumped to $3.7 billion last year, up from $2.3 billion in 2014. In its reports, Ford noted that its U.S. pension plans had a return on assets of minus 1.8% last year compared with a 16.4% return in 2014. ####  ##### Ford sharply reduced contributions to its pension plans in 2015, pumping in $1.1 billion, down from $1.5 billion in 2014. ####  ##### Ford did not disclose its pension plans’ assets and liabilities. Such disclosure will come in several weeks when the automaker releases its 10-K report for 2015. ####  ##### At year-end 2014, Ford’s U.S. pension plans — including plans covering salaried and union employees and retirees — had a funded ratio of 96.8%, with $44.84 billion in assets and $46.32 billion in liabilities. That compares with a funded ratio of 95.5% at year-end 2013 when the U.S. plans had $41.22 billion in assets and $43.18 billion in liabilities. #### "
"USI unit acquires wholesale employee benefits brokerage";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, USI Holdings, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### USI Insurance Services L.L.C. said Monday that it has acquired Marlton, New Jersey-based employee benefits wholesale brokerage CBDI Inc. ####  ##### The terms of the deal were not disclosed. ####  ##### CBDI will combine with Valhalla, New York-based USI’s employee benefits wholesale brokerage unit, Emerson Reid L.L.C., according to a USI statement released Monday. ####  ##### CBDI’s 26 employees will remain at their current location, and the firm’s former President Jack J.

"General Motors pension plan funding improves in 2015 ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Aided by higher interest rates that lowered the value of benefit liabilities, the funded levels of General Motors Co.’s U.S. pension plans rose in 2015. ####  ##### At year-end 2015, the plans were underfunded by $10.4 billion, with $61.1 billion in assets and $71.5 billion in liabilities, the automaker reported Wednesday in a 10-K report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. By contrast, the plans were underfunded in 2014 by $10.9 billion, with $65.8 billion in assets and $76.7 billion in liabilities. ####  ##### GM’s pension plans are substantially smaller than a few years ago, the result of pioneering moves to shrink the plans. ####  ##### For example, at year-end 2011, the U.S. plans had nearly $109 billion in liabilities and about $94 billion in assets. One year later, the plans had $82.1 billion in liabilities and $68.1 billion in assets. ####  ##### That roughly $27 billion reduction in liabilities that occurred between 2011 and 2012 was the result of twin actions the Detroit-based automaker took in 2012 to reduce the size of its pension plans. ####  ##### One of those steps was an offer GM made to 44,000 salaried employees who retired after Oct. 1, 1997, and before Dec. 1, 2011, to convert their monthly annuities to a cash lump-sum payment. In all, GM paid about $3.6 billion to the 13,000 plan participants who accepted the offer. ####  ##### As the second part of its pension de-risking strategy, GM purchased a group annuity from Prudential Insurance Co. of America for $25.1 billion. The annuity replaced benefits that about 76,000 salaried employees who retired before Oct. 1, 1997, received from GM, as well as retirees who declined the lump-sum conversion offer. #### "

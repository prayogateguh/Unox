"AIR Worldwide estimates Hurricane Irene insured losses at $3B to $6B";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, P/C Insurers";" ##### BOSTON—Insured losses from Hurricane Irene likely will be between $3 billion and $6 billion, according to catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide Corp. ####  ##### Boston-based AIR said Monday that its estimate for onshore property losses in the United States included estimates for wind and storm surge damage to onshore residential, commercial and industrial properties and their contents, automobiles and time element coverages such as business interruption for commercial properties, and additional living expenses for residential properties. ####  ##### AIR said its estimate assumed a 10% take-up rate for commercial flood insurance policies and that insurers eventually would pay about 10% of modeled storm surge damage and wind losses for residential insurance coverages. ####  ##### The catastrophe modeler said the range of its loss estimate reflected continuing uncertainty about the surface-level wind speeds caused by the storm. ####  ##### Hurricane Irene caused widespread destruction along the U.S. East Coast after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in North Carolina on Aug. 27. ####  ##### Initial estimates by Oakland, Calif.-based EQECAT Inc. put insured damage in the Carolinas at between $200 million and $400 million, while Silver Spring, Md.-based consultant Kinetic Analysis Corp. said total U.S. insured losses from the storm likely would be slightly less than $3 billion. #### "
"SEC takes China-based Deloitte unit to court";"Risk Management";"Regulation, China";" ##### WASHINGTON (Reuters)—The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a U.S. federal court to force a Chinese unit of accounting giant Deloitte & Touche L.L.P. to produce records related to possible accounting fraud at Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd. ####  ##### The effort by the U.S. regulator to enforce a subpoena against Shanghai-based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd. underscores the difficulties American regulators face in probing U.S.-listed Chinese companies. ####  ##### The SEC and the FBI have been probing U.S.-listed Chinese companies and their auditors amid a rash of accounting scandals. ####  ##### Deloitte's China unit said it wished to co-operate with the SEC but that it is unable to give them the requested documents without approval from the Chinese regulatory authorities. ####  ##### ""We have passed on the SEC's requests to the regulators in China, as we are required to, but so far the China regulators have not given us permission to provide papers to the SEC,"" said Hong Kong-based company spokesman Wilfred Lee in an emailed statement. ####  ##### ""This is essentially a matter between regulators in China and the United States; Deloitte China is happy to comply with any outcome that is agreed between them,"" he added. ####  ##### The Deloitte unit abruptly resigned in May after uncovering ""numerous improprieties"" during its audit of the Chinese software company for the year ended March 31. ####  ##### The case could mark a major escalation in the diplomatic battle between the two countries to allow American regulators access to U.S.-listed Chinese firms, accounting experts said. ####  ##### ""This is the biggest thing that has happened in the transnational regulation of accounting in history,"" said Paul Gillis, visiting professor of accounting at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University. ####  ##### A failure by Deloitte to comply with the SEC order may lead to the loss of its registration with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Mr. Gillis said, a move that would have serious implications for U.S.-listed Chinese firms as other auditors might stop working for them. ####  ##### ""The nightmare scenario for a lot of people would be that the court directs the PCAOB to revoke Deloitte's registration,"" said Mr. Gillis. ####  ##### ""A lot of these U.S.-listed stocks have just become riskier because the listings of these companies may be in jeopardy if all these accounting firms have to bail out."" ####  ##### The SEC said Deloitte had argued it should not be required to produce documents that pre-date the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street oversight law, and that producing any documents could subject it to sanctions under Chinese law. ####  ##### ""This is a culture clash that the SEC is throwing to the courts to resolve,"" said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former senior counsel in the SEC's enforcement division and now a partner at Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy & Ecker P.A. ####  ##### The subpoena enforcement filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington marks the boldest move yet by the agency against a big accounting firm in its crackdown on fraud at Chinese companies that list on U.S. exchanges. ####  ##### Next month, U.S. and Chinese accounting watchdogs are due to meet in Washington for a second round of talks on joint inspections of auditing firms in China. ####  ##### The chairman of the U.S. PCAOB recently chided big accounting companies, saying they had a responsibility for the quality of audits conducted by their units in other countries. ####  ##### Jake Zamansky, an attorney who pursued investment banks after the dotcom crash on behalf of investors, predicted Deloitte would ultimately comply with the subpoena. ####  ##### ""Ultimately the SEC and PCAOB can take their license away. As long as it has the name Deloitte on it, they have a responsibility to adhere to U.S. laws,"" said Zamansky. ####  ##### That move though could be fraught with risks for Deloitte's standing with the Chinese authorities if it fails to win their blessing to hand over the documents before doing so. ####  ##### ""Deloitte really are between a rock and hard place here. If they don't comply it's a possibility they may lose their rights to do U.S. audits, if they do it's possible they will lose their right to do all audits (in China),"" said Peking University's Mr. Gillis. ####  ##### The SEC is seeking evidence to support its investigation into what it described as ""an apparently massive fraud on the domestic securities markets"" by Longtop, a Cayman Islands corporation with principal offices in China and Hong Kong. ####  ##### It said Deloitte had failed ""in every respect"" to comply with its subpoena. ####  ##### ""Compliance with an SEC subpoena is not an option, it is a legal obligation,"" said Robert Khuzami, the director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ####  ##### ""Subpoena recipients who refuse to comply should expect serious legal consequences."" ####  ##### Subpoena enforcements by the SEC are relatively rare, with the agency filing just 31 similar actions in the past five years. ####  ##### Prominent previous recipients of SEC subpoena enforcements have included Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and tobacco company RJ Reynolds. ####  ##### The SEC said the Deloitte documents may reveal how any fraud schemes were able to continue undetected for years at Longtop. ####  ##### It said the date of the Dodd-Frank law was irrelevant, and its interest in obtaining Deloitte's documents ""far outweigh China's secrecy interests."" ####  ##### Perrie Weiner, the international co-chair of the securities litigation practice at DLA Piper in Los Angeles, said the SEC is wading into untested territory as it tries to compel non-U.S. based companies to hand over documents. ####  ##### ""I think it's going to be a significant uphill battle to enforce subpoenas issued by U.S. courts in China,"" said Mr. Weiner. ""We have yet to see how this will play out."" ####  ##### Longtop's U.S. depositary shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after an initial public offering in 2007. ####  ##### In May, the NYSE halted trading in Longtop and delisted the company last month. At the time its shares were halted, Longtop had a market capitalization of $1.09 billion. ####  ##### Its shares now trade on the pink sheets and closed 17.7 percent lower at 28 cents on Thursday. ####  ##### Late last month, Longtop disclosed it had received a Wells notice from the SEC indicating it may face civil charges for accounting problems. ####  ##### U.S. officials are hoping China will agree to joint inspections of auditors, although they do not expect an agreement until sometime in 2012. ####  ##### ""This is a battle that I think is going to be fought in the headlines and with diplomacy and it's not going to be a battle that's going to turn on neat legal points in the courtroom,"" said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University. #### "

"UBS rogue loss hammers risk efforts, new risk boss";"Risk Management";"";" ##### LONDON (Reuters)—A $2 billion rogue trading hit at UBS deals an early blow to its new chief risk officer, previously head of risk at Lehman Brothers, and undermines claims by the Swiss bank and the industry that such events are a thing of the past. ####  ##### Maureen Miskovic took over as chief risk officer at UBS at the start of the year. She arrived from U.S.-based financial services group State Street with a strong reputation and has shaken up risk management at the bank, according to one industry source. ####  ##### So news on Thursday that a single trader had lost UBS around $2 billion in unauthorized deals, and the arrest of 31-year-old Kweku Adoboli in London in connection with the case, stunned the market and sent shares skidding. ####  ##### ""It's astonishing given the technology, the systems, the emphasis on risk. UBS has been focusing on it, post-crisis they've put more focus on it than a lot of other banks,"" the industry source said. ####  ##### ""I'm surprised that this many years after (previous rogue trader) Nick Leeson there are still the Jerome Kerviels of the world, and now this one. How does a 31-year-old rack up a $2.0 billion loss without anybody noticing?"" ####  ##### Others said the crisis showed lax supervision at UBS and threw the spotlight on an industry that will always compel some staff to take excessive risks to keep ahead of rivals. ####  ##### ""No rogue trader works in a vacuum, and UBS' management must have taken its eye off the ball to allow a trader to operate on this scale without sufficient supervision and without the systems to monitor his trades,"" said Simon Morris, a partner at U.K. law firm CMS Cameron McKenna. ####  ##### ""They, and the shareholders, must now pay the bill for this laxness."" ####  ##### Ms. Miskovic, who is based in Zurich and directly reports to Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel, had been head of risk at State Street from 2008 to 2010. From 1996-2002, she was chief risk officer at Lehman Brothers, the U.S. investment bank that collapsed three years ago Thursday. Before that she worked at Morgan Stanley. ####  ##### She replaced Philip Lofts, a UBS veteran who was promoted to head UBS Americas. ####  ##### UBS, which is struggling to regain investor confidence and rebuild its credibility after years of crises, warned it might post a loss in the third quarter after the latest blow threatening the future of its investment bank. #### "
"Suit against Liberty Mutual alleging extortion by executive settled";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, P/C Insurers, Liberty Mutual";" ##### NEW YORK—A former law firm for a unit of Liberty Mutual Group Inc. has reached an undisclosed settlement with the insurer in which an unnamed executive was accused of bribery and extortion. ####  ##### According to the complaint in Michael J. Devereaux & Associates vs. Liberty Insurance Underwriters, Mr. Devereaux's law firm had worked for the unit for seven years until December 2010, and had a “friendly and professional relationship” with the executive, “Mr. X.” ####  ##### However, Mr. X “started and repeatedly sought favors from Mr. Devereaux, including, among other things, requests for Mr. Devereaux's house apartment keys and the use of Mr. Devereaux's home apartment.” ####  ##### In late October and November 2010, the executive allegedly started making comments, such as defense attorneys being a “dime a dozen,” according to the complaint filed March 28. ####  ##### Beginning last November, Mr. X demanded that Mr. Devereaux pay $50,000 for every $1 million of fees incurred in representing Liberty International's insureds “and threatened Mr. Devereaux that unless his bribe was met that he would make sure that the Devereaux firm would not be paid for its prior work, and would never get any more work,” according to the complaint. The complaint said Mr. Devereaux “refused to be extorted” and his firm was discharged. ####  ##### The suit sought payment for numerous cases and accuses Liberty Mutual of breach of contract, extortion, unjust enrichment and bad faith, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and unethical conduct, among other charges. ####  ##### Mr. Devereaux said that while the amount of the settlement will not be disclosed by court order, Liberty Mutual had posted a $688,000 bond in the case. ####  ##### “Our attorney's fees and costs are being paid,” said Mr. Devereaux. “I consider it a vindication of our firm” he said, adding Mr. X has been fired. ####  ##### In a statement, Liberty Mutual said, “We are pleased that litigation has been resolved, and that we have concluded our relationship with the Devereaux firm.” #### "

"$5.8B class action filed against Sino-Forest after trading suspended";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### TORONTO—Two institutions have filed a class action lawsuit alleging that misconduct led to stock price declines of Toronto-based Sino-Forest Corp., whose trading has been suspended by the Ontario Securities Commission. ####  ##### The lawsuit, which seeks $5.8 billion, was filed Monday in Ontario's Supreme Court by Toronto-based Northwest & Ethical Investments L.P., a mutual fund manager, and by Quebec-based Comité syndical national de retraite Bâtirente Inc., a labor-sponsored retirement system. ####  ##### It was filed on behalf of investors who purchased Sino-Forest shares or notes from August, 17, 2004, through June 2, 2011. ####  ##### The lawsuit alleges that the defendants “fundamentally misrepresented the integrity of Sino-Forest's business operations and financial reporting, and materially overstated its assets and financial results,” according to a statement by the plaintiffs. ####  ##### 20 executives, directors named ####  ##### Defendants in the lawsuit include Sino-Forest's current and former auditors, 15 financial firms that brought Sino-Forest note offerings to market, certain forestry consulting firms and 20 of the company's directors and executive officers, the plaintiffs said in a statement. ####  ##### Sino-Forest operates commercial forest plantations in China. ####  ##### Sino-Forest's securities suffered severe market declines after an analyst's report in June questioned the integrity of its asset valuations, revenues, business practices and financial reporting, according to the plaintiffs. ####  ##### The Ontario Securities Commission ordered that Sino-Forest's trading of securities be suspended in August. The commission said in its order that the company “appears to have engaged in significant no-arm's-length transactions which may have been contrary to Ontario securities laws and the public interest.” ####  ##### It also said the company and certain officers and directors “appear to have misrepresented some of its revenue and/or exaggerated some of its timber holdings” by providing false or misleading information. In addition, it said, then-Chairman, CEO and Director Allen Chan appears to have engaged in fraud. ####  ##### Sino-Forest has raised about $3 billion from public investment and/or debt securities issues since 2003, including four public offerings between 2004 and 2009 that raised about $1.05 billion, according to the commission. ####  ##### Top executive resigns ####  ##### Two days after the commission's announcement, Sino-Forest announced that Mr. Chan had voluntarily resigned pending completion of an independent committee's review of the analyst's allegations. William Ardell, lead director and chairman of the independent committee, was named chairman; and Judson Martin, executive director and the company's vice chairman, was named CEO. The company said it also placed three employees on administrative leave. ####  ##### In its August announcement, Sino-Forest said that its business is complex, “the scope of the review is significant and there are enormous amounts of data that have been marshaled and are under review. In these circumstances, the independent committee has not yet reached any conclusions.” It said also it is cooperating with the commission. ####  ##### A company spokeswoman had no comment on the lawsuit. #### "

Shiu said in a statement. “Cargill has discriminated against vulnerable workers. OFCCP is prepared to use every tool at our disposal, including canceling a company's federal contracts when necessary, to achieve the goal of equal opportunity for workers.” ####  ##### The agency said it discovered the company's discriminatory practices during a scheduled review to determine its compliance with Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contactors from discriminating on the basis of race, national origin or sex when making hiring decisions. ####  ##### “The investigation found that the company's selection criteria were subjectively and inconsistently applied. As a result, women were less likely to be employed in entry-level production jobs, and Asian and Pacific Islander job seekers were unfairly favored over other racial groups,” the agency said in the statement. ####  ##### In a lengthy response, the Cargill Meat Solutions spokesman said in its statement, “We find the labor department’s allegations of discrimination to be disappointing given that Cargill’s employee population at Springdale, Ark., is diverse and is 84% minority. We believe the allegations are based solely upon statistical analysis and not based on an analysis of an individual hiring decision.” ####  ##### The statement said, “This situation feels like government-imposed hiring based on historical statistics and not reality.” ####  ##### The company said that from August 2005 to July 2008, the time frame cited by the government, jobs were plentiful in Springdale, Ark. “Cargill Meat Solutions complies with all federal regulations pertaining to hiring practices, including nondiscrimination and legal right to work in the U.S.” ####  ##### The company also said it “selects the best qualified candidates from open positions, without regard to their gender, race/ethnicity, nationality or any other nonjob-related category which complies with both the law and company policy.” ####  ##### Cargill also said the company “remains committed to treating all job applicants and employees fairly.” ####  ##### Cargill Meat Solutions processes turkeys for sale under the brand names Honeysuckle White and Riverside. ####  ##### Observers have said settlement of sex discrimination against units of Tyson Foods Inc., which was announced in September, reflects a more aggressive stance by the federal agency. #### "
"OFF BEAT: Comic book author says 'Cowboys & Aliens' was his idea";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A comic book author claims the producers of the 2011 sci-fi western “Cowboys & Aliens” stole the film’s concept from him more than 15 years before it was released. ####  ##### Steven John Busti, author of the “Bizarre Fantasy” series of comic books, first published his “Cowboys and Aliens” story in 1995, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in an Austin, Texas, federal district court. ####  ##### Mr. Busti’s comic book and the film tell a similar story about extraterrestrials invading the Old West and battling with a band of cowboys. ####  ##### Mr. Busti claims his story was previewed in a 1995 issue of Comic Shop News. Not coincidentally, he claims, an article about Malibu Studios and, more specifically, Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, one of the film’s producers, appeared on the same page. ####  ##### In May 1997, two years after Mr. Busti’s “Cowboys and Aliens” was published, Mr. Rosenberg and Platinum Studios Inc. produced a one-sheet pitch form “featuring a cowboy chased by an alien spaceship titled ‘Cowboys & Aliens,’ according to the suit. Based on that one-sheet, the suit claims Universal Studios and Dreamworks II Distribution Co. L.L.C. bought the film rights to Mr. Rosenberg’s “Cowboys & Aliens” from Platinum Studios. ####  ##### Several years later, in 2006, Mr. Rosenberg and Platinum Studios published their own “Cowboys & Aliens” graphic novel, which Mr. Busti claims bears several similarities to his work, “including an alien spaceship zooming overhead the main cowboy character, the spacecraft being discovered by Native American warriors (specifically Apache) who are then attacked. In addition, the alien commander in the defendants’ work is incredibly similar to the alien conqueror Morguu in Mr. Busti’s work.” ####  ##### Mr. Busti is suing the film’s production studios and its individual producers for copyright infringement, and is seeking damages and additional profits from the film’s DVD and Blu-Ray sales, but has not asked for an injunction barring the film’s distribution. #### "
"Best downgrades MAPFRE Re rating, citing eurozone exposure";"Risk Management";"Spain";" ##### MADRID—A.M. Best Co. Inc. has downgraded its rating of MAPFRE Re, the reinsurance arm of MAPFRE S.A., because of concerns over the company’s exposure to investments in several peripheral eurozone economies, particularly Spain and Portugal. ####  ##### The rating agency said Wednesday that the downgrade to A from A+ also reflects MAPFRE S.A.’s exposure to commercial property in Spain through its investments. ####  ##### Best said the rating actions it has taken concerning MAPRE Re and other European insurers and reinsurers reflect their exposure to the continued deterioration of the sovereign creditworthiness of several countries that use the euro as their currency. ####  ##### “The rationale for taking credit action at this point is largely attributable to the current heightened level of credit and liquidity risk for insurers operating within the eurozone countries—most notably Italy and Spain,” Best said in a statement. #### "

"Japan's Olympus sues execs over scandal, shares surge on M&A hopes";"Risk Management";"Asia-Pacific & Australasia";" ##### TOKYO (Reuters)—Japan's disgraced Olympus Corp. is suing its president and 18 other executives, past and present, for up to $47 million in compensation as it struggles to recover from one of the nation's worst accounting scandals. ####  ##### The maker of cameras and medical equipment on Tuesday said all board members subject to the lawsuit would quit in March or April, leaving it in the extraordinary position for now of continuing with its most senior executive, Shuichi Takayama, and five other directors it is suing for mismanagement. ####  ##### One analyst likened the current board to condemned men, resigned to their fate, and said they would have difficulty over the next few months making any strategic decisions, leaving Olympus more vulnerable to an eventual takeover. ####  ##### ""Essentially, everyone feels they are on death row. It does seem extremely strange to have the death row cell inside the company,"" said Nicholas Smith, head of Japanese equity strategy at CLSA in Tokyo. ####  ##### ""Having nobody at the helm makes it easier for a takeover."" ####  ##### Olympus shares surged as much as 28% on the news, with investors betting the company's clean-up efforts would help it avoid a humiliating delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in turn helping to ensure it stayed on bidders' radars. The stock ended up 20%. ####  ##### Investors also looked forward to the eventual renewal of the board and to Olympus finally drawing a line under a $1.7 billion accounting fraud that has thrown a spotlight on Japan's reputation for weak corporate governance. ####  ##### Olympus has lost almost half its market value since the scandal erupted in October, when it fired its British boss, Michael Woodford—a rare foreign CEO in Japan—for questioning dodgy acquisition deals at the heart of the scandal. ####  ##### ""The plan is for the current board members who were found responsible and are subject to lawsuits to complete passing on their roles to avoid any impact on business implementation, and all resign at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting that is set to be held in March or April,"" Olympus said in a statement. ####  ##### Six of Olympus' 11 directors are being sued: five of its eight internal directors and one of three external directors. ####  ##### Mr. Woodford, who went public with his concerns after his sacking, said last week he was abandoning a bid to be reinstated to his old job, lashing out at big Japanese shareholders for their failure to back his bid. ####  ##### Also among those being sued by Olympus are former Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former Executive Vp Hisashi Mori and former internal auditor Hideo Yamada. ####  ##### An outside investigative panel found last month that this trio had played leading roles in a 13-year scheme to hide losses from Olympus investors. Former presidents Masatoshi Kishimoto and Toshiro Shimoyama were also included in the lawsuits. ####  ##### Olympus is seeking up to 3.6 billion yen ($47 million) in damages, with Messrs. Kikukawa, Mori and Yamada being targeted for the largest amounts. ####  ##### Mr. Shimoyama, who was president from 1984 to 1993, when the firm made many of the securities investments that later turned sour, declined comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit. ####  ##### Olympus said Mr. Takayama had no public comment at this point, and others could not be reached. ####  ##### Olympus' decision to sue follows a report by a separate panel appointed by the firm to look into who was to blame for the scandal. The panel said the 19 current and former executives bore various degrees of responsibility. ####  ##### ""Considering that the truth would have remained in the dark if Woodford had not raised doubts, we must have deep misgivings about the closed nature of Olympus' management to date and the weakness of its corporate governance, which allowed this situation,"" said this panel's report, released on Tuesday. ####  ##### Some big Japanese investors resisted Mr. Woodford's campaign to be reinstated. They said very little publicly, but investment bankers say they were uncomfortable with the Englishman's combative style and also his plans to recapitalize the company through private equity or a rights issue. ####  ##### Rights issues are unwieldy and rare in Japan, and private equity firms are often viewed as foreign asset strippers. ####  ##### Mr. Woodford reiterated on Tuesday that all the existing directors should go. ####  ##### ""If corporate governance is to mean anything in Japan and for those who care about the future of Olympus, the only way forward is an entirely new board of directors untainted by the past scandal,"" he told Reuters by email. ####  ##### Mr. Takayama, in a memo sent to employees on Tuesday and obtained by Reuters, said he and others who were set to resign at the shareholders' meeting would not be actively involved in nominating new directors or in drafting a new business plan. ####  ##### But he added that two internal teams formed to revitalize Olympus and improve its corporate governance—he heads both—would continue to draft proposals for the meeting, though these would first be vetted by outside experts on management reform. ####  ##### Olympus remains under joint investigation by Japanese police, prosecutors and regulators, and that probe could eventually result in criminal charges, although experts have said the firm itself is unlikely to be targeted. ####  ##### British and U.S. authorities are also investigating the affair, which has tarnished the reputation of the once-proud 92-year-old firm and has also stirred calls for reform of Japan's corporate governance regime. ####  ##### Sources told Reuters on Monday that the Tokyo Stock Exchange was likely to keep Olympus listed under a ""security on alert"" designation, which would effectively enable it to remain traded provided it showed steady improvement in its internal controls. ####  ##### The exchange said on Tuesday it had reached no decision. ####  ##### ""Investors are welcoming the move that Olympus shares will remain listed,"" said Ryosuke Okazaki, a director at ITC Investment Partners Corp. ####  ##### ""Investors who have been holding short positions are buying them back heavily. Also investors may be allocating funds into Olympus due to expectations the company will have a new governance. ####  ##### ""As Olympus shares are likely to remain listed, investors are eyeing the company as an M&A target. In this kind of mood, the shares are being bought back heavily,"" Mr. Okazaki added. ####  ##### Olympus needs fresh capital after the accounting fraud, with its accounts recently restated to show it is highly leveraged. ####  ##### Among firms rumored to be potential buyers or partners in a new capital tie-up with Olympus are Fujifilm Holdings Corp., Hoya Corp., Panasonic Corp. and Sony Corp. #### "

Scott Rigell, R-Va., accepted Mr. Buffett’s promise to match voluntary contributions to reduce the national deficit, which Mr. Buffett last week announced as a challenge in Time Magazine. ####  ##### Mr. Buffett’s remarks that the super rich should pay higher taxes spurred critics to quip that if Mr. Buffett thinks he’s not taxed enough, he should send in a check, according to news reports. ####  ##### “If we go to a contribution system—I'll match the total contribution made by all Republican members of Congress, and I'll even go three for one with (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell,” Mr. Buffet said to Time Magazine. ####  ##### In a letter last week to Mr. Buffett, Rep.

Rigell wrote. ####  ##### Mr. Buffett responded to Rep. Rigell in a letter, writing that he’s “delighted” to match the congressman’s 2011 and 2012 contributions. ####  ##### “You are the first to respond, but I hope your action spurs an intramural rivalry between Republicans and Democrats,” Mr. Buffett said in his letter. “This would be a form of competition between two parties that the American public would applaud.” ####  ##### Mr. Buffett said he plans to send the check after April 20 to see if anyone else accepts the challenge. #### "

"OFF BEAT: Beer pong player can't sue bar for injuries";"Risk Management";"";" ##### A would-be beer pong champ has lost a court battle against the bar that served him alcohol before he was struck by a car. ####  ##### Alan Berger was playing beer pong with friends at Wicked Willy’s in New York in June 2009. ####  ##### The drinking game typically requires players to toss ping pong balls into an opposing player’s cup of beer. If the ball lands in a cup, the opposing player must drink the beer as quickly as possible. ####  ##### According to court records, Wicked Willy’s has designated beer pong tables, but it does not monitor the beer consumption of game players. An attorney for Mr. Berger said his client was “winning” the game before he left the bar, the New York Daily News reported. ####  ##### Mr. Berger, then 22 years old, was ""extremely intoxicated"" when he boarded a commuter bus to New Jersey that night, court records show. Hours later, he was hit by a vehicle while attempting to walk across a New Jersey highway. ####  ##### Mr. Berger sued Wicked Willy’s for his injuries last year. He alleged that the bar was negligent in its failure to stop serving him alcohol, among other claims. ####  ##### But the New York Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Berger's suit this month. Judge Lucy Billings said Wicked Willy's was not responsible for Mr. Berger's accident injuries, despite providing alcohol and supplies for beer pong. ####  ##### ""Plaintiff voluntarily engaged in the drinking game facilitated by defendant's furnishings and consumed alcohol to the point of diminished capacity,"" the ruling reads. ""New York law recognizes no duty on defendant's part to warn patrons regarding the risks of engaging in the drinking activity defendant made available or to make it safer by stopping or monitoring its participants."" #### "
"LEO Pharma sued over wage-and-hour violations ";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### NEW YORK—A putative class action wage-and-hour lawsuit over the issue of overtime pay was filed Thursday in federal district court in New York on Thursday against pharmaceutical firm LEO Pharma Inc. ####  ##### The lawsuit was filed by New York-based plaintiffs law firm Sanford Wittels & Heisler L.L.P., which last month reached a $99 million settlement in a wage-and-hour class action lawsuit filed against another pharmaceuticals firm, East Hanover, N.J.-based Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. ####  ##### The latest lawsuit, Lori Hoel et al. vs. LEO Pharma Inc., charges Parsippany, N.J.-based LEO with misclassifying its sales representatives as salaried exempt employees and failing to pay overtime to its employees in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and of corresponding state wage-and-hour laws. ####  ##### LEO, a subsidiary of Ballerup, Denmark-based LEO Pharma A/S, which in turn is owned by the LEO Foundation, specializes in dermatology and critical care products. ####  ##### The lawsuit does not specify the number of employees involved. However, according to a press release issued by the company in December, since opening its U.S. headquarters in December 2009 with five employees, it has added 50 employees in its corporate headquarters and 151 employees to its nationwide sales force, including regional directors, district managers and sales representatives. ####  ##### A company spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. ####  ##### Late last year, in another case on the same issue, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the February 2011 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Michael Christopher et al. vs. SmithKline Beecham Corp., in which the San Francisco-based appeals court ruled pharmaceutical sales reps of the GlaxoSmithKline P.L.C. unit are outside sales employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and are exempt from being paid overtime. #### "

"Lawsuit over allegedly stolen Twitter followers can proceed: Court";"Risk Management";"";" ##### SAN FRANCISCO—A South Carolina media company's lawsuit against a former employee over allegedly stolen Twitter followers can proceed to trial, a federal judge ruled Monday. ####  ##### Mount Pleasant, S.C.-based Phonedog L.L.C., an online publisher of consumer electronics reviews, claims a former California-based writer for the website, Noah Kravitz, stole more than 17,000 Twitter followers from the company when he resigned in 2010, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco in July. ####  ##### When he resigned in October 2010, PhoneDog claims it asked Mr. Kravitz to turn over access to the Twitter account he had maintained on behalf of the company. Instead, Mr. Kravitz allegedly changed the account's online handle from a company-branded name to a personal one and continued using the account—initially to supplement his freelance writing, and later as full-time writer for a competing website. ####  ##### In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, attorneys for Mr. Kravitz argued that PhoneDog had not been able to establish that Mr. Kravitz's conduct directly disrupted economic relationships between the company and the Twitter followers, its advertisers or other media outlets. ####  ##### U.S. Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James on Monday rejected Mr. Kravitz’ motion, noting that the company had demonstrated that the decrease in traffic to its website generated by the loss of the Twitter followers would reasonably impact the company’s ability to sell ad space on its site. ####  ##### “Based on these factual allegations, the Court is able to draw the reasonable inference that PhoneDog had an economic relationship with at least one third-party advertiser that was disrupted by Kravitz’s alleged conduct, causing it economic harm,” Judge James wrote in her decision. ####  ##### In its suit, PhoneDog claims the Twitter followers are the legal equivalent of a client list, which would ordinarily be treated as protected and proprietary information. ####  ##### Using industry standards, PhoneDog estimates the value of the lost Twitter followers at $42,500 per month, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### The company is seeking $340,000 from Mr. Kravitz to make up for the eight months of lost access that had accrued by the time of the lawsuit’s filing. #### "

"Former safety Dave Duerson's family sues NFL over his death";"Risk Management";"Workers Comp Coverage";" ##### CHICAGO—The family of former National Football League player Dave Duerson filed suit against the National Football League on Thursday, alleging the league's concealment of information about concussion risks and failure to take adequate steps to address brain injuries led to brain damage that contributed to Mr. Duerson's suicide last year. ####  ##### The suit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also names football helmet manufacturer Riddell Inc. ####  ##### The suit says Mr. Duerson suffered at least three concussions during his 11-year NFL career, and that examination of his brain at Boston University following his death indicated he suffered from progressive, advanced brain damage known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. ####  ##### The former Pro Bowl safety died in February 2011 after shooting himself in the chest. ####  ##### “If the NFL would have taken the necessary steps to oversee and protect Dave Duerson by warning him of the dangers of head traumas, and educating and training all persons involved with the NFL teams in the recognition, prevention and treatment of concussive brain injuries, then Dave Duerson would not have suffered dangerous repetitive head trauma, would have recovered more rapidly and would not have sustained permanent damage to his brain which contributed to his death,” the suit said. ####  ##### The Duerson family's suit is the latest in a growing number of concussion-related suits filed against the NFL and helmet makers by former players and their families. ####  ##### “(Until) recent times, (the NFL) took the position publicly that there was no relationship between football-related concussions and brain damage,” said Thomas Demetrio, a partner with the Corboy & Demetrio P.C. law firm in Chicago, who is representing the Duerson family in the case. “So it’s more than not educating these players. It’s supplying false information.” ####  ##### “I have a great deal of respect for the fact that prior to dying, (Duerson) told everyone close to him, pled with them, left notes for them…to get his brain to Boston University,” Mr. Demetrio said. “The family is carrying on what they knew their father wanted.” ####  ##### Mr. Demetrio said the extent of damages would be determined during a requested trial. ####  ##### Asked about the suit, an NFL spokesman said by email, “We have not seen the lawsuit and therefore our attorneys have not had an opportunity to review it. Dave Duerson was an outstanding football player and citizen who made so many positive contributions, but unfortunately encountered serious personal challenges later in his life.

"HSBC sells general insurance business for $914M";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### HONG KONG (Reuters)—HSBC Holdings P.L.C. has agreed to sell its general insurance businesses to French insurer AXA S.A. and Australia's QBE Insurance Group Ltd. for $914 million in cash, as Europe's biggest bank moves ahead with its plan to divest noncore assets. ####  ##### HSBC's decision to exit the business could be a precursor to similar deals as lenders globally consider selling capital-intensive businesses as reserve requirements become more strict. ####  ##### ""We expect rising capitalization requirements across the banking and insurance sectors to continue to drive portfolio re-balancing, with some banks in particular reflecting on the value of manufacturing and/or distributing nonlife insurance going forward,"" said Ron Kozlowski, director of Towers Watson & Co.'s general insurance consulting business in Asia Pacific. ####  ##### The deal, the latest in a series of cost-cutting initiatives under new HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver, includes 10-year bancassurance agreements with AXA and QBE. ####  ##### The agreements will earn commissions and profit-related payments for HSBC on top of the cash value of the deal. ####  ##### For AXA, the acquisition is a step forward in its effort to boost its emerging markets presence and potentially help Europe's No. 2 insurer to achieve its 2015 targets ahead of time. ####  ##### AXA regional Chief Financial Officer François-Valéry Lecomte told a media conference that the 2015 targets were based on organic growth, and this transaction accelerates that. ####  ##### AXA Asia Chief Executive Mike Bishop later downplayed any chance the acquisition could help the insurer meet the targets earlier. Speaking in a conference call with reporters, Mr. Bishop called the gains it brought to the entire company ""incremental."" ####  ##### AXA is hoping to double its gross revenues and triple its underlying earnings by 2015 for its general insurance business, under a plan launched last year to boost profits. ####  ##### AXA is paying $494 million for the assets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico, which had a net asset value of $48 million at the end of 2011, HSBC said in a stock exchange filing. ####  ##### AXA also will become the sole provider of general insurance products distributed by HSBC in Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, India and Indonesia, and of property/casualty products distributed by HSBC in Mexico. ####  ##### The distribution agreement does not apply to Hong Kong or mainland China customers of Hang Seng Bank, a unit of HSBC, or HSBC's Chinese rural banks, or to customers of PT Bank Ekonomi Raharja Tbk in Indonesia. ####  ##### QBE will pay $420 million for the business in Argentina, which had a net asset value of $189 million. QBE, Australia's No. 1 insurer by premiums, has completed more than 75 deals in 10 years, expanding its reach to 50 countries. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### QBE's agreement with HSBC gives it the right to be the exclusive provider of general insurance products distributed by HSBC to customers in Argentina and by Hang Seng Bank to customers in Hong Kong and mainland China. ####  ##### In May, HSBC announced plans to sell noncore businesses, which included shrinking its network of 475 U.S. branches to focus on the international business of U.S. clients and the sale of several European retail banking businesses, including those in Poland and Russia. ####  ##### HSBC has cut 11,000 jobs and sold 19 businesses as part of Mr. Gulliver's plan to cut annual costs by $3.5 billion. Deals already struck will cut $50 billion in risk-weighted assets. ####  ##### The deals announced on Wednesday are subject to regulatory approvals and are expected to close in the second half of 2012, while the deal in Argentina may close earlier, HSBC said. ####  ##### The gross asset value of the businesses being sold was $1.23 billion at the end of 2011, it added. ####  ##### AXA will rise to No. 1 ranking in Hong Kong and Mexico and to No. 2 ranking in Singapore following the deal, the company said. QBE said it expects its part of the acquisition to add to its earnings in the first full year. ####  ##### HSBC was advised by HSBC Global Banking & Markets and co-advised on the sale of its Latin American assets by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. was the sole financial advisor to AXA, a source familiar with the matter said. #### "
"Brazil Chevron oil leak charges to focus on safety";"Risk Management";"Asbestos & Environmental, Latin America, Energy";" ##### RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters)—A Brazilian prosecutor plans to allege this week that Chevron Corp. and Transocean Ltd. should not have drilled a deep-water well that leaked in November, legal documents showed, giving a glimpse into expected criminal charges that could slow the rush to develop Brazil's vast offshore oil wealth. ####  ##### The allegations are part of police and prosecutors' reports being used to assemble criminal indictments against U.S. oil company Chevron, drill-rig operator Transocean, and 17 of their executives and employees. ####  ##### The documents, obtained by Reuters, provided the most detailed look yet at possible causes of the oil leak off Brazil's southern coast. They also outline why prosecutors are seeking criminal charges for what industry watchers note is a relatively small spill at a well that was approved for drilling by Brazilian regulators. ####  ##### ""We are in uncharted territory,"" said Cleveland Jones, a Brazilian oil geologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. ""Do we want better environmental standards? Yes. Did the environment get really hurt? No. If you applied the same standards to the whole industry, you'd probably have to shut it down, and we aren't applying the same standards to others."" ####  ##### Authorities on Saturday ordered Chevron's Brazil chief, George Buck, and 16 others to surrender their passports and remain in the country. Criminal charges could be filed by Wednesday, a spokesman for the prosecutor said. A Brazilian judge will then determine whether to proceed with formal indictments. ####  ##### The pending criminal case, along with a record $11 billion environmental lawsuit the prosecutor launched against Chevron in November, show heightened concern over the safety of Brazil's offshore oil boom in the wake of the 2010 BP P.L.C. oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. ####  ##### The Chevron leak was less than 0.1% of BP's massive spill, and no oil reached shore, raising concern from Chevron and others that the charges may be politically motivated or unfair. ####  ##### Much larger and more damaging spills by Brazilian state-run energy giant Petrobras, which owns 30% of the Frade field operated by Chevron where the leak happened, have not led to criminal charges against Petrobras or its executives. ####  ##### Chevron, which says it followed accepted industry practice, sought and received permission last week to shut down production at Frade after finding small, unexplained new leaks in the field that had been producing 61,500 barrels a day. That was down from about 80,000 bpd before the November spill. ####  ##### Prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira told Reuters in January he was merely trying to enforce the law and prevent future spills. ####  ##### A Chevron spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the prosecutor's documents. A Transocean spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the documents. On Saturday, the company said it ""has always cooperated with the authorities and will also continue to vigorously defend its people."" ####  ##### If the charges are filed as expected, the companies and officials probably face years of legal action. Lawyers have had travel bans lifted while similar cases were being litigated, and few individuals or companies have ever been convicted of environmental crimes in Brazil and fewer have gone to jail. ####  ##### Reuters reported Jan. 26 that Santos de Oliveira was preparing charges. The planned indictments were based in part on an investigation by Fabio Scliar, head of the Brazilian Federal Police's Environmental Division in Rio. ####  ##### The well that led to the November leak ""should not have been drilled,"" the report signed by Mr. Scliar says. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### When Chevron drilled into an undersea reservoir, high-pressure oil was able to ""kick"" and surge into the well. ####  ##### A safety valve on the sea floor prevented the oil from shooting up to the Transocean drill rig on the surface, which would have caused a gusher. Failure at such a valve, known as a blow-out preventer, or BOP, led to the BP disaster. ####  ##### The blow-out preventer trapped the kick pressure in the well, cracking the bare rock of the well bore hundreds of meters below the seabed. Oil seeped through the breech into porous rock and cracks then migrated to the sea floor and up to the surface. ####  ##### This should not have surprised Chevron, Mr. Scliar's report said. ####  ##### Chevron's drilling policies and environmental licensing documents required it to use a substance known as drilling mud at pressures sufficient to ""overbalance"" reservoir pressure kicks. Mud removes debris upward and holds oil down during drilling. ####  ##### In the 18 previous wells drilled in Frade, maximum reservoir pressure was between 8.4 and 8.6 pounds per gallon, Mr. Scliar said, citing interrogations of Chevron and Transocean officials. ####  ##### Those wells used mud at pressure of 9.2 pounds per gallon, giving the company a 0.4 to 0.6 pounds per gallon ""mud window,"" or safety margin, the police report alleges. ####  ##### In the well that leaked in November, Chevron expected maximum pressure of 9.4 pounds per gallon and used mud with 9.5 pounds per gallon of pressure, the report said. ####  ##### This provided a mud window or overbalance of only 0.1 pound per gallon, a safety margin only a quarter to a sixth of those used in the previous wells, Mr. Scliar said in the report. ####  ##### Mr. Scliar alleged that this shows Chevron knew the pressure was higher than normal, and used mud with less protection. ####  ##### Chevron used the lower safety margin in the last well because heavier mud might have exerted enough pressure to crack the well bore on its own, according to the report. This, Mr. Scliar alleged, shows Chevron was aware of the higher pressure and weaker-than-normal rock but drilled anyway. ####  ##### Buck said Nov. 24 that Chevron acted responsibly. The cracking of the well wall was an unfortunate miscalculation of reservoir pressure and rock strength, a not-uncommon occurrence in a business that works in places inaccessible to humans and beneath thousands of meters of ocean and rock. ####  ##### Paul Bommer, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Chevron faced a ""classic well-design problem."" ####  ##### ""Normally what happens when the mud window gets this close is people will think of stopping and cementing the well to strengthen it,"" he said. ""This is an area where you have to be very careful."" ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Cementing would have reinforced the bare rock of the well bore against the pressure from the kick and might have prevented the leak, but it would have cost money and time, Mr. Bommer said. ####  ##### Chevron's environmental licenses say the company is supposed to store liquids that can close a problem well aboard platforms. ####  ##### Buck has said it took four days to get mud heavy enough to kill the well from shore because storms made work dangerous. ####  ##### Some say Chevron is not the only one to blame for the leak. Petrobras and Japanese group Frade Japan are minority partners in the field, and Brazil's government approved drilling plans. ####  ##### ""I wouldn't be surprised if Chevron is found to have done a bad job,"" said Ildo Sauer, an oil and gas expert at the University of São Paulo and Petrobras' former natural gas chief. ""But Chevron got approval for its work at every step. It's a farce to attack on Chevron and let the government, with its bigger responsibility, off the hook."" #### "
"EEOC reaches settlements in two pregnancy discrimination cases";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### FRESNO, Calif.—The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday it reached a $140,000 settlement in a pregnancy discrimination case with an agricultural supplier and processor, as well as a $30,000 settlement in another pregnancy discrimination case with a New York-based hair salon. ####  ##### The EEOC charged Olam Americas Inc., a leading supplier and processor of agricultural products and food ingredients, and two of its subsidiaries with denying a job seeker an executive assistant position at its Fresno, Calif., facility because of her pregnancy, in violation of Title VI If the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. ####  ##### The EEOC's lawsuit, which was filed in September, charged that a female applicant initially was offered the position in December 2010, but the offer was rescinded soon after she disclosed she was pregnant. Olam selected a nonpregnant candidate instead, according to the EEOC. ####  ##### Olam issued a statement that said, in part, it “has always believed that sexual discrimination cannot be condoned, and takes any such allegations seriously.  Accordingly, Olam worked diligently with the EEOC towards resolving this matter. In consultation with the EEOC, Olam has agreed to enhance already existing sexual harassment and anti-pregnancy discrimination policies.” ####  ##### The statement also said, “We take our responsibilities as an employer seriously, particularly when it comes to equal opportunity practices.” ####  ##### Olam America is a unit of Singapore-based Olam International Inc. ####  ##### In addition, Warren Tricomi, a New York-based hair salon with locations in Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn., agreed to pay $30,000 and provide a positive employee reference to settle a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit brought by the EEOC in September. ####  ##### The lawsuit charged the firm with rescinding an employee's promotion from assistant colorist to colorist and firing her soon after she disclosed her pregnancy. ####  ##### A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### The EEOC held a hearing on pregnancy discrimination in February. #### "
"Barge company ordered to pay $4.3M to crewman forced to work in Hurricane Katrina";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices, Disability";" ##### EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.—A federal district court judge has told a barge company that ordered its crew to stay on board its Mississippi River towboat during the height of Hurricane Katrina to pay $4.3 million to a crew member. ####  ##### Judge David Herndon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois in East St. Louis, Ill., agreed with the plaintiff in Tyree R. Webb vs. TECO Barge Line Inc. that Mr. Webb had suffered possibly permanent post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of his three-day ordeal. ####  ##### According to Judge Herndon's 73-page decision—issued March 7 after a September 2011 bench trial—as Katrina approached on August, 29, 2005, Mr. Webb was on board the tugboat M/V Anita M, a 170-foot-long inland river towboat, on the Mississippi River near Davant, La. He and other towboat crew members were ordered to stay for the hurricane's duration by an executive of Metropolis, Ill.-based TECO, since renamed U.S. United Barge Line L.L.C. ####  ##### During eight hours of battering by the storm, the M/V Anita M suffered significant damage and required emergency pumps to be set up in order to avoid sinking. ####  ##### The M/V Anita M and another towboat “broke loose from their moorings and were driven by the hurricane onto the land on the opposite bank of the river, approximately one-quarter of a mile upriver and approximately one-half mile west from where they had originally been moored,” according to the decision. After running aground, both vessels “were battered by numerous barges and other objects during the remainder of the storm.” ####  ##### The towboats “were unseaworthy in that they were not reasonably fit to withstand the hurricane to which defendant chose to expose them,” said the ruling. “The court finds that the hurricane posed a very real threat to the lives of the crew members, including plaintiff.” ####  ##### Mr. Webb, who has divorced since the incident and has not returned to work, is constantly fatigued, has difficulty concentrating, is reclusive, has been suicidal and takes five psychiatric drugs, according to the decision. ####  ##### The court found a doctor's conclusion that Mr. Webb's post-traumatic stress disorder “is permanent and disabling to be persuasive and supported by the vast majority of the evidence,” said the ruling. ####  ##### The decision notes that according to the American Psychiatric Assn.'s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, “human design” is “one of the stressors that makes post-traumatic stress disorder longer lasting.” ####  ##### “Although Webb was exposed to a natural disaster, this was because his boss required it. The case therefore presents the human tormentor element present in rape and torture cases as well as the natural disaster feature,” said the judge in awarding Mr. Webb the $4.3 million, which he said is a “direct result of Hurricane Katrina and defendant's negligence.” ####  ##### U.S. United Barge Line's attorney could not be reached for comment. #### "

"Ernst & Young pays $120M to end Swiss legal saga";"Risk Management";"Switzerland";" ##### ZURICH (Reuters)—Big-four audit firm Ernst & Young has agreed to pay 110 million Swiss francs ($120.1 million) to end a long-running legal dispute over its auditing of Banque Cantonal de Geneve, which had to be bailed out by the state. ####  ##### The payment, which will be made to the State of Geneva, BCGE and the City of Geneva, is the largest amount ever paid by an audit company in Switzerland to settle a legal wrangle, and is the audit company's maximum insurance coverage. ####  ##### ""This agreement is an important stage in the gradual resolution of a series of conflicts born from the management of the bank in the 1990s,"" said BCGE in a statement. ####  ##### To allow the payment, attorney general Daniel Zappeli withdrew his appeal against the acquittal in an earlier case of the two former Ernst & Young auditors charged over their auditing of the bank. ####  ##### The audit firm said all civil litigation relating to the BCGE case had been settled without any admission of liability from Ernst & Young. ####  ##### ""The parties have reached a mutual agreement allowing them to conclude this dispute, putting an end to litigation in relation to matters that occurred more than 15 years ago.

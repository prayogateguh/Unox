"J.C. Penney employees access all benefits with Web-based portal";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### J.C. Penney Co. Inc. provides one-stop shopping for employees with questions about any of their company benefits. ####  ##### Using a single sign-on for Web-based portal called Powerline, employees can check their 401(k) balances, apply for 401(k) loans, find out how much of their health care deductibles have been met, read articles about ways to take better care of their health or report the need to take time off from work. ####  ##### The portal, launched in 2009, was built by and is administered by Aon Hewitt, fed with data from J.C. Penney's PeopleSoft-powered human resources information system. Powerline connects Aon Hewitt, which administers J.C. Penney's health and welfare and retirement plans; UnitedHealth Group Inc., which administers the company's lifestyle and medical management systems; Express Scripts Inc., J.C. Penney's pharmacy benefit manager; and Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc., which administers the retailer's total absence management program. ####  ##### The portal also has benefit guides that include summary plan descriptions and health plan tools, such as drug cost comparisons and provider directories. Employees use it to enroll in their benefits at open enrollment and to complete their health risk assessments, apply for a 401(k) loan or get their prescriptions filled. There's even a Web chat feature for employees who have simple questions that don't need the level of assistance provided by call center advocates. ####  ##### J.C. Penney employees “go to one place and they are able to access all of the information they need surrounding their benefits,” said Anita Fulton, vice president of benefits at Aon Hewitt based in Lincolnshire, Ill. “We also have the ability to provide links directly into the Sedgwick system so participants can get their case status” if they are on leave or disability. ####  ##### “We're also doing links in the medical space to the carrier website, where they complete their personal health assessment. It's a seamless experience,” she said. ####  ##### In 2012, Powerline was upgraded to provide special “tier 2” assistance to employees who need additional help addressing certain life events, such as a death in the family, applying for retirement benefits or taking a hardship withdrawal from the 401(k) plan. ####  ##### “We can do a warm transfer to a tier 2 call center advocate who will serve as a guide, walking them through their benefits,” Ms. Fulton said. #### "
"J.C. Penney headquarters' on-site clinic enhances worker productivity, health cost savings";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### J.C. Penney Co. Inc. unveiled the company's clinic and pharmacy to its 3,500 headquarters employees during a 2010 health and wellness fair that also included healthy cooking and fitness demonstrations, biometric screenings and a farmer's market. ####  ##### The facility, located at the company's Plano, Texas, headquarters, is staffed with two physicians, two pharmacists, three nurses, a registered dietician and other support staff. ####  ##### Open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, the clinic looks like any other doctor's office equipped with a waiting room, receptionist and four examination rooms. The pharmacy, open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays, also sells typical drugstore sundries like over-the-counter remedies and greeting cards. ####  ##### “We wanted an affordable option that was convenient,” said Matthew Harmon, benefits delivery and retirement director. ####  ##### With office visits that cost just $10, the clinic, operated by Concentra, a Humana Inc. subsidiary, provides a low-cost alternative to members of J.C. Penney's consumer-driven health plan. This charge is not subject to health plan deductibles, which range from $750 to $4,000. ####  ##### Walgreen Co. operates the pharmacy, which offers prescription drugs at competitive prices, even though they are subject to the health plan deductibles. ####  ##### The clinic costs J.C. Penney about $1 million annually to operate, but Mr. Harmon estimates the return on investment is between four-to-one and five-to-one, based on medical cost savings and enhanced productivity stemming from the fact that employees don't have to leave the company's headquarters campus for minor medical treatment. ####  ##### Headquarters employees also have access to an on-site fitness center, which provides nutrition counseling, exercise equipment and classes, all in support of employee wellness. #### "
"Technology fosters employee wellness participation, accountability";"Benefits Management";"";" ##### Incorporating high-tech gadgetry into wellness programs can boost wellness program participation rates and ensure greater accountability among employees, employers and gamification experts are finding. ####  ##### Rick Stull, wellness coordinator for Colorado Springs School District 11, said the school district used the SonicPed, a wireless and waterproof activity-tracking device provided by Carlsbad, Calif.-based Sonic Boom Wellness, as an inducement to encourage employees to participate in biometric health screenings. ####  ##### Sonic Boom rebranded the Pebble tracking device made by Shelton, Conn.-based FitLinxx as the SonicPed, said Danna Korn, Sonic Boom's CEO and co-founder. ####  ##### “It's generated a lot of enthusiasm among our benefits-eligible employees,” Mr. Stull said. “The SonicPed was free'' if you tracked height, weight, waist measurement and basic blood work. ####  ##### In 2012, the first year the Colorado Springs school district offered the SonicPeds, 68% of employees signed up for biometric screenings, Mr. Stull said. ####  ##### Vlad Gyster, CEO and co-founder of H.Engage, a Boston-based startup that uses text messages as part of a wellness gamification strategy, has seen wellness program participation rates increase significantly when technology is used. ####  ##### For example, Michelin North America's health risk assessment completion rates were 26% higher for employees who agreed to accept regular wellness prompts via text messaging, according to a case study published by H.Engage. ####  ##### While offering a free gadget may ensure greater employee engagement, it also can satisfy an ulterior motive: accountability. ####  ##### “I like having a device or something to report into,” said Merry DeMartino, an executive vice president at Event Network Inc. in San Diego. ####  ##### “We tried to do some homemade gamification where you might have some people not be entirely truthful. It can be de-motivating. But you can't trick the pedometer.” ####  ##### The devices also make tracking activity effortless for employees. The Pebble, developed by FitLinxx, downloads steps, calories burned, activity time and distance traveled via a wireless Internet connection. ####  ##### “When you walk into your workplace or home, the device automatically downloads the data into your PC. The user doesn't have to do anything as long as you're within 100 feet” of the FitLinxx USB connector plugged into the computer, said Dave Monahan, FitLinxx's CEO. #### "
"Matthew Harmon named 2013 Benefit Manager of the Year®";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### J.C. Penney Co. Inc.'s aging employee population was taking a toll on its benefits budget, exacerbating the impact that sluggish post-recession sales were having on the retailer's bottom line. ####  ##### If it did nothing, the cost of providing benefits to its employees would double in five years to $400 million. ####  ##### Though the solution seemed obvious to Matthew Harmon, J.C. Penney's benefits delivery and retirement director, it also was a radical idea at the time, especially for a Fortune 500 company. He proposed replacing J.C. Penney's rich, self-funded preferred provider organization health plan that had copays of just $10 with a high-deductible consumer-driven health plan. ####  ##### But that kind of out-of-the-box thinking was just what Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney needed in 2009. ####  ##### So in 2010, J.C. Penney “pulled off the Band-Aid” that had been insulating its employees from the true cost of health care and went full replacement. Although employees could still receive preventive care at no cost, all other health care services would be subject to a deductible of at least $1,150. ####  ##### Employees were challenged further: Complete a health risk assessment and take steps to get healthier or pay $600 more annually for health benefits. ####  ##### As a result, instead of growing by 8% to 12% annually, as in the past, this one-two punch has slashed J.C. Penney's health care costs by 15%, shaving $30 million off its $200 million annual health benefits budget. ####  ##### Though the plan design was modified somewhat in subsequent years, all of J.C. Penney's benefits-eligible full-time employees continue to be enrolled in a consumer driven health plan. And employees are sharing the savings by keeping their contributions flat and spending less on health care as they lose weight, quit smoking and eliminate the health risks that could have led to costly and debilitating illnesses down the road. ####  ##### For this and other accomplishments, Mr. Harmon, 38, has been named Business Insurance's 2013 Benefit Manager of the Year®. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We were not going to get younger overnight, and we weren't going to become completely consumer-driven overnight. So we looked at the continuum and decided to start by helping people understand what health care actually costs — not $10,” said Mr. Harmon. ####  ##### Today, a self-insured CDHP is the only option offered to J.C. Penney's full-time benefits-eligible population of about 40,000. However, there are four different deductible levels, with premiums based on the amount of risk taken. ####  ##### A user-friendly Web-based portal called Powerline is helping to facilitate this education and transition, along with customer service provided by Aon Hewitt, lifestyle and medical management services provided by UnitedHealth Group Inc., and a total absence management program overseen by Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. ####  ##### Besides revamping the company's health benefits, Mr. Harmon also has made a significant impact on other J.C. Penney benefits programs, such as its 401(k) plan, where enrollment and contributions are up after a targeted communications initiative. ####  ##### J.C. Penney awarded Mr. Harmon the Chairman's Award for Excellence in Benefits in 2009 for his efforts. ####  ##### Mr. Harmon “brings his own brand of compassion, out-of-the-box thinking and energy to people and projects, which to me means he recognizes the ""right thing to do' and then goes about making it possible,” said Brynn Evanson, J.C. Penney's executive vice president of human resources, in a letter nominating Mr. Harmon for this year's Benefit Manager of the Year® award. ####  ##### Mr. Harmon also has taken service partnerships to a new level, treating the external vendors as members of his employee benefits team. ####  ##### “What we have with J.C. Penney is special,” said Laura Dunn, J.C. Penney's Aon Hewitt account executive in Chicago. “Matt views Aon Hewitt as part of his team. To do that, we need a transparent and flexible model. I feel when I'm calling Matt, there are no boundaries. That helps when we need to get things done. We have context, and I trust Matt.” ####  ##### J.C. Penney “is in the throes of a major transformation of their business. Matt has done a very good job of keeping the entire team working together throughout that transformation,” said Bradley F. Johnson, executive vice president of disability operations at Sedgwick. ####  ##### BUSINESS: J.C. Penney operates department stores selling family apparel and footwear, accessories, fine and fashion jewelry, beauty products and home furnishings. It also provides various services, such as styling salons, optical, portrait photography and custom decorating. ####  ##### HEADQUARTERS: Plano, Texas ####  ##### FOUNDED: 1902 ####  ##### 2012 FINANCIALS: $12.8 billion net sales. Traded as JCP on the New York Stock Exchange and a component of the S&P 500. ####  ##### EMPLOYEES: 116,000 ####  ##### Did you know: ####  ##### • J.C. Penney operates 1,104 department stores in 49 states and Puerto Rico. It also sells its products through www.jcp.com. ####  ##### • James Cash Penney opened his first retail operation, The Golden Rule store, in 1902 in Kemmerer, Wyo., in partnership with Guy Johnson and Thomas Callahan. This “mother store” still operates today and was designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1978. ####  ##### • By 1912, Mr. Penney had 34 stores in the Rocky Mountain states. In 1913, all stores were consolidated under the J.C. Penney banner. ####  ##### • J.C. Penney’s store in Anchorage, Alaska, partially collapsed and was damaged beyond repair in the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The company rebuilt the store as a shorter building on a larger footprint, accompanied by the city’s first public parking garage, which opened in 1968. #### "
"Consumer-driven health plans reverse J.C. Penney's employee health costs trend";"Benefits Management";"Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### When most U.S. employers were only dabbling in the consumer-driven health plan concept, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. decided in 2010 to “pull off the Band-Aid.” ####  ##### Although it had offered a CDHP as an option, more than 80% of its employees still were enrolled in a generous, self-funded preferred provider organization plan with copayments as low as $10 for doctor's office visits. ####  ##### But the cost trajectory for the PPO plan was unsustainable for the Plano, Texas-based retailer, which was slow to rebound financially from the Great Recession. ####  ##### “We had a significant issue not unlike any other employer. We were on a trend to double our health care spending over a five-year period,” said Matthew Harmon, benefits delivery and retirement director. ####  ##### Because of J.C. Penney's demographics, “we were seeing significantly higher claims per capita in our population” compared with other retailers, he said. “Medical costs were going up 8% to 12% a year. We also had an older population. The average age of our employees is about 48, and 80% are women.” This compares with the average retail industry age of 34. ####  ##### Since “we were not going to get younger overnight,” Mr. Harmon and his staff, with management support, decided the solution was to teach employees to treat health benefits like other consumer items. ####  ##### “We shop for car insurance; we shop for a multitude of things in our daily lives; and the thing that's arguably the most important, we spend the least amount of time on. ... So we knew that we had to make a major paradigm shift. We needed to get our people to become more engaged and be better consumers of their health care,” Mr. Harmon said. ####  ##### “There's the pull-off-the-Band-Aid approach, which we knew we needed to get to very quickly because health care costs were not shrinking, they were growing; and so the installation of a full consumer-driven approach with the right tools to help people be better consumers was something we felt very strongly about. That was for annual enrollment for the plan year beginning Jan. 1, 2010.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Today, 100% of J.C. Penney's benefits-eligible full-time employees are enrolled in a CDHP with a health reimbursement arrangement administered by UnitedHealth Group Inc. Employees have a choice of four deductible levels — $750, $1,150, $2,500 and $4,000 for single coverage, and double those amounts for family coverage — with premiums reflecting the amount of risk being taken. ####  ##### “We started with $1,150 and $2,500 and then we learned that some people wanted to be able to budget more, so they were happy to pay more in premium for a lower deductible. Others who were young and invincible wanted a higher deductible for a lower premium,” Mr. Harmon said. ####  ##### J.C. Penney contributes $200 to the HRA for employee-only cover, $400 for an employee and one dependent and $600 for family cover. Preventive care is covered 100%. ####  ##### Initial responses from employees were “a mixed bag,” he said. ####  ##### Some responded negatively, others positively. Others didn't realize the switch had even occurred until they used their benefits after the conversion, he said. ####  ##### “It was pretty typical of a consumer-driven switchover, where the first couple of years were pretty tenuous,” Mr. Harmon said. ####  ##### In the first year after the conversion, J.C. Penney saved $30 million, 15% off its previous annual health benefits budget of about $200 million. The rates of increase over the subsequent two years have been relatively flat. It also kept employees' premiums flat. ####  ##### Mr. Harmon attributes much of the success of the CDHP conversion to J.C. Penney's provider partnerships. “When you have something as huge to change as consumer-driven, you can go design something, but if you can't administer it in a way that your team members understand it, then it's no good. If you can't communicate it to them, then it's no good. If you can't service them every day when they call in with questions, it's no good.” ####  ##### UnitedHealth and Aon Hewitt, J.C. Penney's benefit plan administrator, “have been tremendous partners to help us deliver on those strategies in short time frames, and they've come to the table every time with ideas and experiences and book-of-business numbers to help us drive where we're going,” Mr. Harmon said. #### "
"J.C. Penney moves toward total absence management program";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### If J.C. Penney Co. Inc. employees are unable to come to work for any reason — illness, injury, a death in the family — they soon will be able to notify Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. ####  ##### After receiving that notice, either reported to a call center via a toll-free telephone number or online via J.C. Penney's Powerline portal, Sedgwick will mobilize to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to replace that person in the workplace and to help them return to work as soon as possible. ####  ##### Whether that involves filing a workers compensation claim or simply directing them to appropriate medical care for a nonoccupational illness, Sedgwick serves as their total absence manager, regardless of the cause. ####  ##### “We want to build a model where we get to total absence and productivity management,” said Matthew Harmon, J.C. Penney's benefits delivery and retirement director. “It's about managing people's return to work, about making sure they're productive when they are at work and that they get the care they need.” ####  ##### For example, a hairdresser calls in sick at 10 a.m. because seasonal weather has triggered an asthma attack. Sedgwick will contact that person's supervisor to have  someone cover scheduled appointments. Sedgwick also will guide the worker to appropriate medical care to manage the condition and remain productive, said Bradley Johnson, vice president of disability and absence management services at Sedgwick in Memphis, Tenn. ####  ##### “We also are working with J.C. Penney to understand the key drivers of absence so we can better manage incidental absence impacting its operations,” he said. And because of the technology component “there will be a higher level of integration, providing customized solutions so managers and supervisors can see why employees are not at work.” ####  ##### The ultimate objective is to “take the guesswork out of absence, whether it's due to something that happened at the worksite or outside of the worksite,” said Paul Barden, CEO of Pacific Resources Benefits Advisors L.L.C., the Chicago-based broker that worked with Mr. Harmon to find the  provider partner. ####  ##### This innovative program, which has been evolving over the past three years, already is saving J.C. Penney “millions” by reducing the incidence and duration of unscheduled absences, Mr. Barden said. ####  ##### “We are challenging Sedgwick as a vendor to deliver something that is not out there in the marketplace. We benefit from it because we have the best programs possible for our employees. They benefit from it because they develop a model that other employers want. This is a problem that is not unique to us,” said Mr. Harmon. #### "
"Benefit brokers moving from sales to service";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Claims Management, TPA";" ##### COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado — As employers demand more services from benefits brokers, brokers are seeking new ways to deliver value and cost savings. ####  ##### Fortunately for brokers, the evolving benefits landscape has offered several opportunities to transform their business models from transactional insurance middlemen to one-stop-shops for benefits and human resources. ####  ##### “There's a transition from brokers really being focused strictly on the employee benefits arena and everything around helping employers secure benefit rates and best plan designs for employees, and it's getting much more into everything around supporting the human resources team,” said Adam Bruckman, president and CEO of Digital Insurance Inc. in Atlanta. ####  ##### The shift, which has been in the works for several years, is partially driven by the health care reform law's complexity, which has left employers in need of broker support for compliance and regulatory issues. Rising health care costs have prompted many employers to shift to high-deductible health plans, which demand more communication with workers and a menu of voluntary benefit options for brokers to help assess. ####  ##### Techcentric benefits startups that combine benefits brokering with HR capabilities have driven employers to think of brokers as consultants and providers of anything benefits and HR managers could need, including payroll, absence management, onboarding, wellness and benefits design, several brokers said during interviews at the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers May 31-June 3 Employee Benefits Leadership Forum in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ####  ##### Employers in the past “may have looked at a technology company for this, and a HR outsource company for this, and a broker for negotiating rates. Now there's a convergence of all those things,” under the brokerage umbrella, Mr. Bruckman said. ####  ##### That means brokers “are really trying to expand their full capabilities, not just their ability to negotiate rates and plan design,” he said. “It's a lot of hard work because you have to train producers on these new solutions, and you have to address all these employer needs.” ####  ##### Digital Insurance, for example, has hired specialists in everything from technology to wellness to meet employers' needs. ####  ##### Brokers have evolved from advisers to “a very, very heavy service mode. It's a business partner mode,” said Kent Crawford, Newport Beach, California-based managing principal at Integro Insurance Brokers. ####  ##### Employers expect brokers to devise benefits strategies as well as execute them, he said. As benefits have become more complex and employers introduce high-deductible health plans to save costs, communicating those changes has become a major broker role. ####  ##### “You are introducing plan designs that are requiring that employee to be much more engaged in the process” of selecting and using the benefit plan, Mr. Crawford said. “That discussion is becoming more complex on a day-to-day basis.” ####  ##### “The broker, as we strive to be relevant to our clients, has moved from just being a product expert and delivering a quality product ... (to) you being the product yourself,” said Jim O'Connor, Manasquan, New Jersey-based president of employee benefits at CBIZ Inc., which has its own platform that integrates benefits consulting and human resources processes. ####  ##### Brokers are acting as benefits administrators, compliance advisers, communication experts and sometimes even outsourced HR departments, he said. ####  ##### Importantly, brokers have also taken a leading role in helping employers to “bend” the health care cost trend, Mr. O'Connor said. ####  ##### “This is where the broker has to evolve his or her knowledge (to) be an expert in the provider side of the equation: What's going on in the world of doctors and hospitals and how are they changing in the equation of benefits?” he said, pointing to accountable care organizations and high-performance physician networks. ####  ##### Because spending on all health plan types and prescription drugs has risen steadily, cost savings won't come from “shopping for better rates and finding a network that has a huge difference in the amount of provider discounts they provide,” said Dan Gowen, Chicago-based senior vice president and national employee benefits practice leader with Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA Inc. ####  ##### Instead, brokers “need to be making sure that we're spending a lot of time with our clients, understanding the risks in their population, how to keep the healthy (people) healthy, and how to try to keep those that are in the chronic condition stages from moving into more acute types conditions. The more that you can balance that out the better you are going to be from a total cost perspective on a year-over-year basis.” ####  ##### “We are spending a tremendous amount of time on transparency and cost control, especially around pharmacy strategies, given the explosion in cost relative to pharmacy and specialty drugs,” said Mike Barone, San Diego-based president of employee benefits at Hub International Ltd. “Brokers who have an ability to understand the space and propose strategies to their clients to reduce cost and improve outcomes are going to have a unique competitive advantage relative to those who don't.” ####  ##### While brokers' roles have expanded, their commissions haven't. ####  ##### “You are working with potentially the same dollar, but you've got more that you are trying to do to meet the needs of our clients,” Digital's Mr. Bruckman said. ####  ##### Part of the reason commissions haven't grown is health care costs make it difficult for employers to spend their money elsewhere, said Jennifer Walsh, San Francisco-based senior vice president and national employee benefits business leader at Woodruff-Sawyer & Co. ####  ##### Competition also is keeping commissions down. “I have more competitors today than I had five years ago,” she said. ####  ##### On the plus side, some sources said they are making more money in fees. ####  ##### “We're seeing some movement away from commissions and into fees,” said Mr. Barone. “What we're seeing in the marketplace are several larger consulting firms take their commissions down a little bit, but build them up significantly on the technology side and benefits administration side.” ####  ##### “So in aggregate, especially when larger and mid-market clients are buying technology, they're actually paying a lot more than they ever have,” Mr. Barone said. #### "
"Small-town guy makes leap to huge job";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management";" ##### Life has carried Marty Webb, vice president of benefits at AT&T Inc., a long way from a small Missouri town to the Dallas skyscraper where he now works. ####  ##### Mr. Webb, 57, grew up in Jasper, Missouri, a farming community with a population of less than 1,000. ####  ##### “My dad was a third-generation hardware store owner” and “it was clear that there was no future in that business,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### Mr. Webb also was not satisfied with the idea of only a high school education. ####  ##### “I always wanted to go to college, even as a youngster, and (my parents) knew that. So no, I was never really pushed into the business at all. In fact, I think they knew I wanted to do something different, so they were always very encouraging. ####  ##### “I went to college at Missouri State University in Springfield. I thought I wanted to be a lawyer, but didn't have any money, so I thought I would get a job,” said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### College led directly to the telecommunications industry. ####  ##### “My first job was at Southwestern Bell (Telephone Co.), and I was actually a computer programmer for a while, so I thought I'd stay awhile, and decided one day that rather than go down the legal path, I'd go down the business path,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### That led to an MBA at St. Louis University and, in turn, to greater opportunities at Southwestern Bell, with Mr. Webb working in areas including billing, investor relations and strategic planning. ####  ##### “One day I was asked if I would go over to the benefits organization. That was not something that I had necessarily aspired to, but there were great opportunities. At that point in time, we had gone through a number of mergers and we were getting larger as a company,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Webb and his wife, Denise, have three children. One son works as a retail store manager for AT&T, while a daughter just graduated from college and another son is still in college. ####  ##### “I'm pretty much a family guy,” he said. “I just like spending time with my wife and kids when I can.” #### "
"Retirement savings matter for all employees";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### AT&T Inc.'s Your Money Matters program helps pave the way for its workers' retirement, according to Marty Webb, vice president of benefits in Dallas. ####  ##### Both Your Money Matters and Your Health Matters are part of the You Matter program, with Your Money Matters primarily focused on pensions and savings, said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### “In fact, pensions is one of the areas we feel we've made some great strides in,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Webb also noted that employees' 401(k) accounts are often their greatest source of wealth and what they think about when preparing for their retirement years. ####  ##### “We feel we have an obligation to help people prepare for that as best they can,” including its health and financial aspects, “and so we do what we can to educate employees to participate fully in their 401(k),” said Mr. Webb. “We are close to 90% of our employees who are actively participating in their 401(k),” he said. ####  ##### Similar to its approach on health issues, “we also send out a lot of education on Your Money Matters, and we do seminars that focus on anything from investing to budgeting to meeting (workers') retirement needs,” said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### “And we've even done a couple of things that focus on specific sectors of employees,” he said. The most recent was a video on Generation X employees, he said. ####  ##### AT&T has also held a seminar looking at women's investments, he said. And one still in the planning stages will focus on people who are nearing their retirement years. ####  ##### AT&T seminars are filmed and then made available on the Web, he said. They can have attendance ranging from 50 to 100 people “and we'll speak directly to them, but we'll also broadcast it at the same time so anybody can participate and look at the presentations, and they can ask questions over the Web also,” Mr. Webb said, adding that thousands of people will sometimes participate. #### "
"A healthy outlook for AT&T employees";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits";" ##### AT&T Inc. is one of the largest companies in the world, but Marty Webb is giving it a small-company flavor. ####  ##### Acting on his strongly held belief that he and the company need to do well by AT&T's workers, the vice president of benefits tries to make each worker feel that the telecommunications giant cares about them personally. This philosophy has led to robust 401(k) programs and the transfer of some 200,000 Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents into Aon P.L.C.'s private health insurance exchange. ####  ##### A centerpiece of Mr. Webb's efforts, earning him a spot on the 2015 Business Insurance Benefits Management Honor Roll®, is AT&T's health care program. ####  ##### “We're a hard-working company focused on developing the right products and services and doing so in an environment where lots of changes are occurring because technology is changing dramatically,” he said. ####  ##### “We're nothing without our people and we need them to be healthy, we need to provide tools for them to be trained” on healthy practices, he said of AT&T's more than 240,000 current employees. “It's a people-based business, and if we don't provide the right structure, the right sense of care for our people and the right benefits for our people, then we just won't be successful.” ####  ##### As the company has grown, so have the number of workers and retirees receiving benefits. ####  ##### “Today, we offer health care benefits to over 1 million people; so when you think about it, we offer health care to about to one out of every 300 people within the United States,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### That presents “all types of different opportunities” to offer programs to employees and retirees “and do it in the right fashion, where it's a robust benefit to the people, where it's appropriate for their lifestyles at a cost that makes sense to AT&T,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### The result was the 2012 launch of Your Health Matters, which is “a brand we developed to encompass all of our health care benefits,” including the “tools and resources to lead happier lives,” Mr. Webb said. This program goes beyond traditional medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, disability and life insurance to focus on wellness “and to the extent (employees) have any sort of a chronic problem, a disease management program,” he said. ####  ##### Your Health Matters is backed by a broad communications program that includes incentives for and video vignettes about employees “who have done something ... to lead healthier or happier lives,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### For example, employees can choose a goal that will help them live healthily, such as exercising four times each week, limiting fast food to once a week or quitting smoking. ####  ##### “We do a lot of messaging on this,” he said. Four reminders are sent out about the program during the year. Employees also are asked several questions about their progress to help develop their story. ####  ##### “It even includes changes in our cafeterias, to provide (employees) with healthier options,” he said. ####  ##### The program has entered its second phase, which again includes the Chairman's Challenge in which AT&T Chairman Randall L. Stephenson “asks people to go on their own journey, to set some goals to lead healthier lives.” ####  ##### Mr. Stephenson also participates in Your Health Matters. ####  ##### About 24,000 people are participating in the second phase. When it's complete, employees will select the Chairman's Choice winners, who are given funds to contribute to a charity of their choice, said Mr. Webb. ####  ##### Three people will get $5,000 apiece and three winning groups will receive $10,000 each to donate to a charity, he said. ####  ##### As part of the program, AT&T is using an application that allows people to synchronize with personal devices such as Fitbits to track their weight, sleep patterns, medication or stress management, he said. ####  ##### “It can be whatever they're trying to change in their life to lead a healthier life,” Mr. Webb said. ####  ##### Participants electronically track their progress throughout the challenge. ####  ##### Mr. Webb said he also participates in the program with a group of fellow benefit employees. His goal is “to lose the nagging 10 pounds” he has been dragging around. “I'm about halfway there,” he said with a chuckle. #### "
"Health care reform COBRA rules bridge public exchange coverage gap";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Recent federal guidance allows employees who lose their group health coverage when they leave or lose their job to get health insurance through public exchanges sooner and with no gaps in coverage by temporarily enrolling in COBRA. ####  ##### The COBRA guidance, included in 436 pages of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act regulations issued last month by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, addresses the health care reform law's requirement that those enrolled in COBRA wait until the next open enrollment period to move to coverage through a public health insurance exchange. ####  ##### The wait can be costly because COBRA enrollees typically pay the full group premium to continue coverage through former employers. In 2013, for example, the average annual premium for employer plans was $5,884, or about $490 per month, for individual coverage and more than $16,300, or about $1,350 a month, for family coverage, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. ####  ##### Coverage through a public exchange, though, can be substantially less. ####  ##### According to an HHS report last week, enrollees in 36 states in which the federal government operates exchanges paid an average of $82 a month for coverage due to federal premium subsidies for lower income individuals. Without the subsidies, the enrollees would have paid $346 a month. ####  ##### Exchange coverage “can be a much better deal” than COBRA, said Elizabeth Vollmar, vice president and co-director of compliance services at Lockton Cos. L.L.C. in St. Louis. ####  ##### But individuals can't get exchange coverage right away. Federal rules say for people who lose employment-based coverage, public exchange coverage cannot begin until the first day of the month following enrollment — resulting in a coverage gap, which the HHS guidance eliminates. ####  ##### Under the regulations, individuals who lose employment-based coverage could opt for COBRA and, within 60 days, enroll in a public exchange plan. Once the exchange plan goes into effect, HHS said the individual could end COBRA coverage. ####  ##### An example, provided by Buck Consultants L.L.C., illustrates how this interplay can work: ####  ##### An employee loses group coverage on Aug. 1. On Sept. 10, he or she enrolls in an exchange plan, with coverage to start on Oct. 1. On Sept 10, he or she also opts for COBRA, with coverage retroactive to Aug. 1. Retroactive coverage is permitted under COBRA. Then on Sept. 30, the individual drops COBRA, with the exchange coverage starting Oct. 1 and avoiding a gap. ####  ##### “This gives individuals an additional window for coverage,” said Rich Stover, a Buck Consultants principal in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### The approach also could be appealing to those who already have met their health plan deductibles for the year, or want to ensure they can stay with their current doctor. Those individuals could keep their COBRA coverage for a limited period and then move over to an exchange plan. ####  ##### Meanwhile, the availability of the federal premium subsidies for exchange coverage could lead to curtailment of a plan design in which employers, as part of a severance package, pay COBRA premiums for several months for employees they let go. ####  ##### Instead, Andy Anderson, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius L.L.P. in Chicago, said an employer would give those individuals a cash lump sum, which could be used to pay for COBRA or exchange premiums. ####  ##### That approach could be cost-effective for employers if the individuals opt for exchange plans, since COBRA beneficiaries tend to be heavier users of health care services than other individuals. A rough rule of thumb, consultants say, is that for every dollar COBRA enrollees pay in premiums, they incur $1.50 in health care costs. ####  ##### “This deals with the adverse selection issue,” Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### While some experts had said public exchanges under the health care reform law would lead to the end of COBRA coverage, that view is fading. ####  ##### “COBRA will continue to be a health coverage alternative,” said Bruce Richards, individual insurance exchange leader at Mercer L.L.C. in Richmond, Virginia, noting, for example, that exchange premium subsidies are available only to those with incomes of up to 400% of the federal poverty level. ####  ##### “COBRA will not disappear,” Mr. Anderson said. ####  ##### “The rumors of COBRA's demise are somewhat overstated. It still will have a role in filling gaps in coverage,” said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. #### "
"Self-funding health care program cuts costs for Palm Beach County school district";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits";" ##### While prevention and detection through a sweeping wellness program are at the core of the School District of Palm Beach County's efforts to keep health care costs under control, a variety of other actions also has been pivotal, says Dianne L. Howard, the West Palm Beach, Florida-based school district's director of risk and benefits management. ####  ##### One of the first cost-saving steps Ms. Howard took was to move the school district to a self-funded health care benefits program in 2007. ####  ##### Two big reasons — both financial — drove the decision to self-fund. ####  ##### “We decided to self-fund when we realized the profits the insurer was making every year,” Ms. Howard said. “Insurers build in a risk corridor, since they are taking the risk if our claims exceed what they expect. It's probably at least 5% of the premium.” ####  ##### In addition, by self-funding, the school district does not have to pay the premium tax the state of Florida imposes on health insurers, a cost insurers typically pass on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums. ####  ##### Ms. Howard estimates that by self-funding — reaping the risk corridor profits and an exemption from insurance premium taxes — the school district saves about $10 million a year. In addition, the school district gets “more detailed reporting, since the data is ours,” she said. ####  ##### Networking led to another way for Ms. Howard to reap millions of dollars a year in savings for the school district's prescription drug benefits program. ####  ##### Through her membership in the Orlando, Florida-based Florida Health Care Coalition, an organization whose employer members have about 2 million enrollees in their health care plans, Ms. Howard became aware of prescription drug rebates. ####  ##### Under such arrangements, prescription drug manufacturers give rebates to insurers in exchange for positioning their drugs on lower copayment coverage tiers that cost less for plan enrollees, resulting in the sale of more of that drugmaker's prescriptions. ####  ##### After learning of the rebates, Ms. Howard approached UnitedHealthcare, the administrator of the school district's prescription drug program, and asked it to forward the rebates to the school district. UnitedHealthcare made a counteroffer: It would discount the administrative fees it charged the school district for running the prescription drug benefits program. ####  ##### The offer was significant: UnitedHealthcare said it would cut its administrative fee by $5 per employee per month, for a total savings of $1.2 million. ####  ##### But Ms. Howard declined. “I said I don't want the $5 discount because I wouldn't get the data or even know what the rebates actually were. I said we would take 80% of the rebates.” ####  ##### UnitedHealthcare advised there was a “cash-flow concern” involving the rebates. The insurer told Ms. Howard that the drug manufacturers didn't immediately distribute rebates and, as a result, the school district could have to wait as long as nine months after a plan year began before the rebates would start to roll in if it wanted a share of them. ####  ##### Ms. Howard didn't find that argument persuasive: “Cash flow was not a problem for us. So receiving rebates would work for us.” ####  ##### Ultimately, UnitedHealth agreed to pass on 80% of the rebates it received from the drug manufacturers, later increasing it to 100%, saving the school district about $5 million per year. ####  ##### “They valued our business,” Ms. Howard said. “Our challenge is to stay ahead of where the money is hidden” in the health care system. ####  ##### In other cases, digging through claims data resulted in significant cost savings. For example, in 2012, the school district began to impose deductibles and coinsurance requirements for diagnostic treatment and magnetic resonance imaging. ####  ##### Digging through claims data, Ms. Howard saw that deductible and coinsurance had not been applied to the MRI claims. “That didn't make sense,” she recalled. ####  ##### A months-long investigation by UnitedHealthcare revealed that claims had not been properly adjudicated. “We were self-funded, so it was our dollars” that were incorrectly being spent, Ms. Howard said. ####  ##### In the end, the appropriate cost-sharing requirements were administered, and the school district recouped $4 million in claims that plan participants, not the school district, were responsible for paying. ####  ##### Other sources of savings have been periodic audits of health care coverage eligibility. At one time, about 1,000 people who were no longer eligible — such as employees' adult children who, because of their age, were not eligible to remain on their parents' coverage or employees who had terminated employment — still had claims being paid. ####  ##### “We started chipping away at the problem,” Ms. Howard said. Ultimately, enrollment audits saved the school district $4.4 million by detecting those no longer eligible for coverage, she said. #### "
"Zurich uses pension de-risking strategy to cut costs and maintain benefits";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits, Zurich";" ##### A pension de-risking strategy that included offering a temporary lump-sum payment window in 2012 to a select group of terminated vested participants resulted in a significant one-time reduction in pension expenses and an ongoing reduction in administrative costs for Zurich North America. ####  ##### And a change to a more conservative investment mix in response to an asset liability study following the recent economic downturn will further help to protect the assets of the company's defined benefit pension plan going forward, according to Zurich North America Benefits Consultant Lisa Anderson. ####  ##### Over the next few years, the target allocation of Zurich North America's pension fund assets will gradually transition from 55% equities and 45% bonds to 30% equities and 70% bonds, according to Sarah Staggs, head of benefits for the Schaumburg, Illinois-based North American unit of Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., who added that she and her team are continuing to explore other de-risking opportunities. ####  ##### “Unfunded pension liabilities do affect what an insurance company can do with its capital expenditures,” she said. ####  ##### But Zurich North America has no intention of terminating its cash balance plan, because the company's leadership views it as a competitive necessity since approximately 60% of large property/casualty insurers continue to offer defined benefit pension plans, according to Ms. Staggs. ####  ##### Still, with a large number of terminated vested employees still among its plan participants, many of whom had fairly small balances in the plan, it made sense to offer lump-sum distributions to reduce the amount Zurich North America was paying in premiums to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., she said. ####  ##### Of the 6,324 terminated vested plan participants eligible for the special lump-sum distribution, 2,415, or 38.19%, accepted the offer. This resulted in a 19% reduction in PBGC premiums, a 12% reduction in administrative costs, and a 9.2% reduction in the company's pension obligations, Ms. Staggs said. ####  ##### “The goal around de-risking was containing costs and maintaining benefits,” Ms. Staggs explained. “And with the costs around pension administration, paying PBGC premiums and costs of searching people down, there's this question: Does someone who worked here 30 years ago still have a vested interest in Zurich, and do we have a vested interest in them? We wanted to make sure that this was seen as spending benefits dollars wisely.” #### "
"Zurich's Sarah Staggs named to 2014 Benefit Management Honor Roll®";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Zurich";" ##### Using a strategic yet humanitarian approach to addressing benefits challenges, Sarah Staggs, head of benefits for Zurich North America, has slowed the rate of health care spending at the property/casualty insurer from an annual rate of 20% at the beginning of the decade to just 4% in each of the past four years. ####  ##### Ms. Staggs also has led a pension risk-reduction strategy that included changes in investments and offering a temporary lump-sum window to a select group of terminated, vested plan participants, resulting in a significant one-time reduction in Zurich's pension liabilities and long-term savings in administrative costs. ####  ##### For her employee benefits achievements, Ms. Staggs has earned a place on Business Insurance's 2014 Benefit Management Honor Roll®. ####  ##### By fostering a grassroots wellness campaign led by volunteer “wellness champions,” Ms. Staggs also has enabled Schaumberg, Illinois-based Zurich North America, a unit of Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., to be named one of the nation's Best Employers for Healthy Lifestyles by the Washington-based National Business Group on Health for two consecutive years. ####  ##### And to help Zurich North America employees achieve financial wellness, Ms. Staggs instituted automatic enrollment in the company's 401(k) plan starting with a 6% payroll contribution so employees could maximize the company's matching contribution of 6%. ####  ##### She also helps employees maximize their retirement savings by trimming administrative costs for the company's 401(k) plan participants through unbundling and reallocating fees, which enabled their investments to transition to the lowest-cost share classes available from their plan administrator, The Vanguard Group Inc. ####  ##### “When we define what we do as a company, Zurich's mission is to help our customers understand and protect themselves from risk. And you only have to change one word in that to describe what I feel like our department's mission is: To help our employees understand and protect themselves from risks,” said Ms. Staggs. “Those risks can be health care risks; they can be financial risks; they can be lifestyle risks.” ####  ##### After identifying the risks facing Zurich North America employees, as well as the organization that keeps them employed, Ms. Staggs developed and implemented a multiyear strategy that continues to evolve as conditions and laws change, such as the passage the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010. ####  ##### “Sarah was talking about this change a long time ago, before health care reform was enacted,” said Brian Little, head of human resources for Zurich North America and Ms. Staggs' supervisor. “With Sarah's strategic approach to plan design, we will be able to stay on course without being subject to the Cadillac tax and still be able to have robust benefits,” he said, referring to the excise tax on benefits that exceed a certain threshold beginning in 2018. ####  ##### “Like most companies, you have to sell leadership on the cost benefit for what you're doing, and Sarah's very good on the mathematical end of the equation — helping people understand that if you spend money, you're going to get a return on your investment,” Mr. Little said. “But sometimes the return isn't immediate; it's not next quarter. It may be next year or a couple of years after that. So understanding trends is really important, as is being able to translate that into strategic actions over a longer period of time. Sarah's very good at taking the data that comes out of the various firms that we work with and translating that into opportunities for us to think about.” ####  ##### “Sarah is always thinking ahead and about potential downstream effects,” agreed Kristin Bajorat, benefits consultant at Zurich North America and a member of Ms. Stagg's team responsible for health and welfare benefits. “Sometimes you go to seminars where they ask how many companies actually have a strategic plan. We're one of the companies that actually has one.” ####  ##### Ms. Staggs also seeks input from the team she has assembled since joining Zurich North America in 2002, all of whom are subject-matter experts in their own right. ####  ##### “It's definitely a collaborative partnership. That's what makes Sarah a good leader. She listens to what we have to say and asks us to share our ideas,” Ms. Bajorat said. ####  ##### Trained as a teacher, Ms. Staggs also encourages members of her benefits team to pursue continuing education and attend benefits management conferences, where they can gain knowledge to help Zurich North America foster its culture of health and wealth. The company's business strategy is “to deliver sustainable, profitable growth” while remaining committed to shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which they live and work. ####  ##### “I've been in benefits for a long, long time, but I'm still learning from her,” said Lisa Anderson, the benefits consultant responsible for Zurich North America's defined benefit pension plan. “I'm just so proud of us as a team.” ####  ##### Ms. Staggs also “is very empathetic when it comes to work/life balance, which for me is critical,” said Dawn Carthan, the benefits consultant responsible for Zurich North America's 401(k) plan administration and the mother of a special-needs child. ####  ##### “Because we're a large company, even small changes in cost potentially impact revenue,” Mr. Little noted. “At the same time, it's not simply about how much it costs. It's about how you spend your dollars and what kind of value you get from that, because you really want to have competitive benefits. If you don't, then you won't have the talent that you need to be successful as an organization. So even though costs are really important, it's not the only decision-making factor we use. It's more about for every dollar we spend, what do we get in return?” ####  ##### “In her leadership role, Sarah is responsible for implementing a strategy focused on driving change and meeting the needs of Zurich's employees. This strategy has empowered employees to become better health care consumers by providing them with consumer-centric tools coupled with the appropriate financial incentives. The results of this work are evidenced through the marked reduction in the number of employees displaying high health risks and the market-competitive medical benefits program that has operated at an average cost 15% below industry benchmarks for the past four years,” said Scott Ziemba, health and group benefits consultant at Towers Watson in Chicago who has worked closely with Ms. Staggs in developing and implementing Zurich's strategy. #### "
"Zurich's head of benefits lowers costs by implementing consumer-driven plans";"Benefits Management";"Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits, Zurich";" ##### Sarah Staggs, head of benefits at Zurich North America, implemented a multiyear consumer-driven strategy to put the brakes on the insurer's health care spending, which had been careening out  of control with annual increases of more than 20%. ####  ##### By gradually reducing health care plan offerings to just three levels of consumer-driven health plans administered by a single insurer, and by emphasizing consumerism and wellness, Ms. Staggs has whittled those annual increases down to an average of just 4% over the past four years for the Schaumburg, Illinois-based North American unit of Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. ####  ##### “When we first looked at introducing consumer-driven health plans in 2002, we were experiencing 20% to 21% annual increases in medical costs when the rest of the world was probably more like 10% or 11% and moving down. But we weren't moving down, so we realized there was something we had to do relatively quickly,” Ms. Staggs recalled. ####  ##### “I think we were experiencing part of the problems of what was happening in some of the smaller companies, trying to unify them into a larger program,” she said. “We had just merged five companies together to form Zurich North America and had a combination of different health plans and providers.” ####  ##### “We also realized we needed to move to the concept of ""Your health care doesn't cost that $20 copay. Your doctor's visit cost the company the other $80 you didn't have  to pay.' And we need to make sure that people are getting the right care at the right time in the right place. People were using emergency rooms for basic health care when a doctor's office visit could handle it,” Ms. Staggs said. ####  ##### Ms. Staggs' first step was to consolidate health plans, which enabled her to negotiate a better deal with one health plan vendor: United Healthcare. ####  ##### “We gained some efficiencies there. It made our job of communicating internally easier. We weren't spending so much time explaining the difference between three different vendors. We were explaining what does the plan cover, how should you use it, and here are the tools that can help you make the best decision for you to meet your health care needs,” she said. ####  ##### Her next steps were to introduce a CDHP with a health savings account as an option in 2005, and then to gradually eliminate the plans with lower deductibles, adding two other options with even higher deductibles, all with HSAs. Today, Zurich North America offers just three CDHPs: Choice Plus HSA, with a $1,250 single/$2,500 family deductible; Choice Max HSA, with a $2,000 single/$4,000 family deductible; and Choice Premier HSA, with a $2,800/$5,600 deductible, Ms. Staggs said. ####  ##### Zurich North America also contributes $500 to HSAs for single coverage if an employee contributes at least $100 of their own money, and $1,000 for HSAs linked to family coverage if an employee contributes at least $200. The funds are deposited annually on Jan. 1 so that employees who need to pay for health care expenses within their deductibles early in the year have access to them. ####  ##### Since the middle-level CDHP has become the most popular benefits option, with 44% of Zurich North America's benefits-eligible employees enrolled, and with the average HSA account balance at the end of 2013 being $3,396, the consumerism strategy appears to be working, according to Ms. Staggs. ####  ##### “We have done a lot on the design side with going to full-replacement high-deductible health plans to push the button as far as we can on design, realizing that we've actually reaped some benefits as a company for that because our per capita spend is lower than the national average,” Ms. Staggs said. “Part of the benefit of that is employees are responsible for a little bit more of the first dollar, but we look at it also that people have become better consumers. They ask more questions.” #### "

"Employers rethink benefits after gay marriage ruling";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide figures to affect employers' benefit strategies for years to come. ####  ##### For many employers, the June 26 ruling in James Obergefell et al. v. Richard Hodges et al., which invalidated state laws denying marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, will reduce the administrative burden of providing health and retirement benefits to employees' same-sex spouses. ####  ##### Additionally, experts said, the decision may compel employers offering spousal-equivalent benefits to same-sex domestic partners to eliminate that coverage now that full marriage rights are available in all states. ####  ##### “It's truly a landmark decision from both the social and benefits perspectives, and I think it's going to have a dramatic impact on employers and how they approach their benefit plans going forward,” said Scott Cooper, a Philadelphia-based partner at law firm Blank Rome L.L.P. ####  ##### As a result of Obergefell, employers that fully insure their group health care plans must offer married same-sex couples the same coverage as opposite-sex couples. ####  ##### About 39% of U.S. employees were covered under fully insured health plans at the end of 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. ####  ##### Employers that self-insure their health plans can elect not to cover employees' same-sex spouses even if they cover married opposite-sex couples. ####  ##### However, experts said, such a strategy could be legally perilous, particularly in light of Obergefell as well as the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in U.S. v. Edith Windsor et al., which recognized same-sex marriages under federal law. ####  ##### “The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has taken the position that sexual-orientation discrimination can constitute sex discrimination under Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act), so employers that continue to exclude same-sex spouses need to be mindful of the legal risk,” said Todd Solomon, a Chicago-based partner at McDermott Will & Emery L.L.P. ####  ##### For most employers that offer equal spousal benefits to married couples regardless of sexual orientation, last month's ruling eliminates the need to impute taxes separately for benefits provided to same-sex couples in states that did not recognize their marriage. ####  ##### “The advice we'll be giving to all of our clients is to very quickly figure out what they need to do and then communicate that out to their employees,” Mr. Cooper said. “There's a lot of explaining that's likely going to need to be done.” ####  ##### With marriage rights now available to gay and lesbian couples in all 50 states, experts say employer-sponsored health coverage for same-sex domestic partners — offered by 46% of large and midsize companies before the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling — could decrease in future years. ####  ##### “The question for a lot of employers is going to be what kind of transition period they're looking at for phasing out domestic partner benefits,” said Steven Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the Washington-based National Business Group on Health. “You want to make sure that if you're going to phase out those benefits, you do it gradually and with significant communication, so your employees have time to plan and adjust.” ####  ##### A key factor in many employers' decisions could be the extent to which they already cover opposite-sex domestic partners. ####  ##### “If the employer also covers opposite-sex unmarried partners, it is unlikely to eliminate any coverage because it already covers a set of unmarried employees who have had the ability to marry,” Mr. Solomon said. “On the other hand, if the employer covers only same-sex unmarried partners, it might deem it most fair to require those employees to marry in order to retain their benefits.” ####  ##### While eliminating domestic partner coverage might be a sound financial and administrative strategy, experts say employers should weigh the decision carefully, particularly given the lack of employment discrimination protections for gay and lesbian workers at the federal level and in 28 states. ####  ##### If same-sex couples identify themselves by getting married and seeking spousal benefits, they could be exposed to workplace bias based on their sexual orientation, experts said. ####  ##### “That's one of the issues that's going to have to play out over the coming weeks, months and perhaps even years,” Mr. Cooper said. “It's important to look at what the Supreme Court's decision was and what it was not, and what the ruling did not necessarily answer are questions regarding outright employment discrimination.” ####  ##### Other questions include at what point state-level coverage requirements will take effect and whether employers will allow retroactive spousal coverage. ####  ##### “I suspect that the timing and mechanics of the various state regulators rolling out those pieces of guidance will follow very closely to what we saw after Windsor,” where the first IRS guidance was issued about two months later, said Beth Alcalde, a managing partner at Akerman L.L.P. in West Palm Beach, Florida. “It might even come faster than it did after the Windsor decision, simply because it has been done before at the federal level and in certain states.” ####  ##### Also unclear is the potential for conflicts between the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell and its June 2014 ruling in Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. et al. v. Sylvia Burwell, which exempted closely held, religiously inclined employers from having to provide employees with cost-free contraceptive coverage. ####  ##### “What happens if you've got an employer that claims a religious objection to same-sex marriage?” asked Susan Hoffman, a Philadelphia-based shareholder at law firm Littler Mendelson P.C. “Without federal protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation, the question becomes whether a closely held employer with those objections can legally discriminate against same-sex couples.” #### "
"Redefining the value of wellness";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Employers have long used return on investment to demonstrate how much a dollar spent on workplace wellness saves on medical costs, but the results often are disappointing because ROI fails to capture the broader effect of employee health interventions on the overall business. ####  ##### That's why some companies are looking, instead, to measure value on investment, which assesses how an employer's wellness strategy affects business goals, such as improving employee health, safety, productivity and engagement. ####  ##### “We need to step back and look at the whole enchilada,” said Ron Leopold, Atlanta-based national practice leader of health outcomes at Willis North America Inc., on measuring wellness programs' value on investment. ####  ##### Beyond reducing medical costs, wellness programs improve employee morale and engagement and reduce absenteeism, presenteeism, and workplace injury, he said, so “let's recognize that the work that we do impacts the entire pie.” ####  ##### Many employers, including Fortune 500 giants such as Dow Chemical Co., General Electric Corp. and PepsiCo Inc., believe that a healthy employee population is a business advantage, said Shelly Wolff, health and workforce effectiveness leader at Towers Watson & Co. in Stamford, Connecticut. ####  ##### However, as Rand Corp. concluded in a recent study of workplace wellness programs, not all generate a positive financial return, and a reduction in health care costs should not be the only indicator of an effective wellness program. The study linked participation in “lifestyle management programs” that promote healthy living to improved health risks and reduced absenteeism. ####  ##### The challenge for benefits leaders is proving the value of wellness programs to top executives, Ms. Wolff said. With value on investment, “you're starting to get at broader business metrics (CEOs and chief financial officers) already believe in.” ####  ##### Where the term originated isn't clear. It may have seeped into workplace wellness from the information technology sector. In 2001, IT consultant Gartner Inc. described value on investment in a research paper advising companies to capture the “soft” benefits of their investments, beyond the easily quantifiable cost savings or revenue generation. ####  ##### “We've always recommended to clients that they think about ... the value of the change that they're trying to bring about and think about it in a broader, more qualitative way,” said Gartner Vice President and analyst Carol Rozwell, a co-author of the report. ####  ##### Employer organizations, providers and consultants are leading the charge to help businesses think beyond ROI. ####  ##### The National Business Group on Health and Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Optum Inc. surveyed 275 large companies last year to identify top reasons for investing in wellness. Reducing employee health risks and health care costs and improving productivity ranked highest, while other key drivers included reducing disability claims, improving employee job satisfaction and improving business performance. ####  ##### Yet only one-third of employers said they have the metrics to justify investments in health and wellness, the survey found. ####  ##### It's not that they don't have the data; it's that the data resides in different departments or with external providers. The difficulty is “being able to pull those data sources together and to understand what it's telling you,” said Karen Marlo, a vice president at the NBGH in Washington. ####  ##### This year, the Health Enhancement Research Organization and Population Health Alliance published a guide to help employers measure and evaluate their workplace wellness programs. One chapter proposes a value-on-investment framework by calculating inputs — wellness program costs, incentives, and outcomes or employers' goals, such as reducing presenteeism (ailing employees working at reduced capacity) or improving job satisfaction. ####  ##### “Just as we easily think of the price of a gallon of gas or a loaf of bread, we can now talk about the price of an ex-smoker or a pound of weight loss,” said Craig Nelson, co-leader of the research organization's and health alliance's value on investment work group and Minneapolis-based director of health services research at American Specialty Health Inc., the parent of the Healthyroads wellness program. Healthyroads provides fitness, nutrition, weight management and other services to health plans and employer groups. ####  ##### While there's no single proven method to measure value on investment, companies are beginning to gather data points and set up dashboards to track variables such as employee absence, disability and turnover. Most, however, are far from spitting out numbers tying wellness efforts to specific outcomes. ####  ##### “We're talking about taking some qualitative data and turning it into something quantitative, and that can be a little bit tricky,” said Tami Simon, managing director of knowledge resources at Buck Consultants at Xerox in Washington. “How do you measure ""I'm happier. I feel better. I like coming to work more?' How do you quantify that for a CFO?” ####  ##### What's more, 47% of U.S. employers in Buck's 2014 Working Well survey said they had not measured specific outcomes of their health promotion programs. ####  ##### But Seth Serxner, Optum's chief health officer in San Francisco, said the value-on-investment exercise is useful because it opens a conversation about where wellness fits into a company's human capital and well-being strategy beyond cost containment. #### "
"Tailor wellness programs to individual workforces for maximum effect";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### LAS VEGAS — Rising health care costs are front of mind for most employers, but there are several ways to ease the burden. ####  ##### Implementing a wellness program is one. But companies seeking to reduce health costs through wellness programs should tailor them to the organization's business needs, employees' health risks and the preferences of the employee base, experts say. ####  ##### It's important to view wellness as “part of a strategy of profitability of the company” and not “just a good thing to do,” said Charlie Estey, executive vice president of business development at Schaumburg, Illinois-based Interactive Health Inc. ####  ##### “There's plenty of research to show the impact of wellness, not just on medical costs and productivity, but on the value of the company,” he said during the Society for Human Resource Management Inc.'s recent conference in Las Vegas. ####  ##### Wellness programs also can reduce workplace injuries, workers compensation claims, and absenteeism and presenteeism rates, while boosting productivity and attracting and retaining talent, he said. ####  ##### To implement a successful wellness program and achieve support from the company's leadership, Mr. Estey recommended determining what problem the company is trying to solve and tailoring the program to address that need. For example, he said, if many employees smoke, tools need to be in place to help them quit. ####  ##### It's also important, he said, to educate employees about their role as active health consumers and how unaddressed health risks can increase out-of-pocket costs under a high-deductible health plan. ####  ##### Bruce Elliot, SHRM's Alexandria, Virginia-based benefits manager, said wellness programs work best when companies build them around data from a health risk assessment. If companies are not reacting to that data, then the wellness program isn't “going to bear any fruit,” he said. ####  ##### Another tactic to reduce health care costs is implementing a medical self-care program, said Don Powell, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based American Institute for Preventive Medicine. ####  ##### Medical self-care involves teaching employees to make better decisions about when and when not to access care, he said. ####  ##### “I think too much of our ways of trying to reduce health costs tend to focus on the supply side; that is, having employees pay more out of pocket (and) ... having to get permission before you can do certain things. We need to focus more on the demand side” of employees through programs such as medical self-care, he said. ####  ##### What's more, while a wellness program may take two to three years to show financial benefits, the benefit of medical self-care “occurs almost instantaneously” as employees change their habits of accessing care, he said. ####  ##### Other experts say moving to a defined contribution type of health plan and shifting costs to a private health insurance exchange also can reduce employers' costs. ####  ##### Though a private exchange won't fix health care cost trends, it will engage the employee in the decision-making process and enable the employer to control annual increases in health care costs, said Rob Harkins, Boston-based practice leader of private exchanges at Willis North America Inc. ####  ##### Employers also are looking at telemedicine to reduce medical spending. Receiving health services or education remotely via a live videoconference, not only is a cost-effective alternative to an on-site clinic, it also reduces the need for an employee to go to a more expensive urgent care clinic, said Stewart Levy, president of Princeton, New Jersey-based health care consultancy Health Promotion Solutions. ####  ##### Telemedicine also increases access to care for scattered or rural employees as it alleviates transportation barriers, he said. ####  ##### Twenty-two percent of employers offered telemedicine consultations to employees last year, and 37% said they expect to offer them this year, according to a 2014 Towers Watson & Co. analysis of employers with 1,000 or more employees. Interest in telemedicine is expected to keep growing, and “everything is moving in the right direction from a regulatory perspective,” Mr. Levy said.  “It's all about the care and the ability to provide care more efficiently.” #### "
"More early retirees to be covered via insurance exchanges";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Employers' move to jettison health insurance for pre-Medicare-eligible retirees is certain to accelerate in the wake of last month's U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of premium subsidies for lower-income individuals getting coverage in the state and federal exchanges. ####  ##### Dropping coverage and directing retirees, in some cases with employer financial support, offers “win-win opportunities” for employers and retirees, said John Grosso, health care actuary and leader of Aon Hewitt's retiree health care task force in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### For employers, the appeal is obvious: With premiums averaging more than $12,000 per year per retiree, according to a 2014 Mercer L.L.C. survey, eliminating those plans would slash employer costs even if they contribute to health reimbursement arrangements to help pre-Medicare-eligible retirees defray some of the cost of buying coverage in a public exchange. ####  ##### “I can't think of an employer for whom this approach would not make sense to consider,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey. Employers would have a “more manageable amount that is not subject to health costs and trend,” he said, referring to employers' HRA contributions that retirees could use to purchase exchange coverage. ####  ##### In some cases, retirees wouldn't even tap employers' HRA contributions to buy coverage in the exchange. ####  ##### That is because under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, people whose incomes are between 100% to 400% of the federal level — or $11,700 to $47,080 for an individual — are eligible for federal premium subsidies to buy coverage in public exchanges. ####  ##### The subsidies — in the case of lower-income early retirees — might be far larger than employers' HRA contributions, increasing the likelihood that they would turn down the HRA contribution and take the government's premium subsidy to buy exchange coverage, resulting in additional employer savings. Federal rules make clear that the retirees cannot take both the HRA contribution and the ACA premium subsidy to purchase exchange coverage. ####  ##### For retirees eligible for the government's premium subsidies for exchange plans, the cost savings that they could rack up could be considerable, especially if their former employer previously paid only a small percentage of the premium in the plans they offered to retirees. ####  ##### While the financial advantages of directing the retirees to the public exchanges were obvious, experts say one key issue held employers back from adopting the approach: Would the Supreme Court uphold the IRS rules authorizing federal premium subsidies in both state exchanges and in the 34 states where federal regulators set up exchanges after states officials declined to do so? Plaintiffs in the case alleged that the health care reform law limited the subsidies to those obtaining coverage in state exchanges ####  ##### So the Supreme Court's June ruling upholding the IRS premium subsidy rules “removes one of the last barriers that had been holding back many employers from taking this approach,” Mr. Grosso said. ####  ##### “A major barrier has been taken off the table,” said John Barkett, director of health policy affairs at Towers Watson Exchange Solutions in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Just 26% of employers still offered health insurance to early retirees as of last year, according to Mercer, and the Supreme Court's ruling looks to accelerate that trend. Still, not every employer will adopt the approach. ####  ##### “An employer with high-income pre-65 retirees might be less inclined to suggest that the retirees access a public exchange because they would be less likely to be eligible for subsidies,” said Amy Bergner, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Washington. ####  ##### In addition, some employers may wait to see how successful insurers that offer exchange coverage are in attracting medical providers to their networks. ####  ##### “Employers may want to see more exchange experience before jumping in,” Mr. Barkett said. ####  ##### Plan documents that may bar employers from eliminating early retiree coverage or collective bargaining agreements requiring union agreement also could limit adoption, said Judy Bauserman, a Mercer partner in Washington. ####  ##### Another factor that could hold back employers is a concern that the 2016 elections could result in electing a president who backs repealing the health care reform law that spawned the exchanges and the premium subsidies. ####  ##### “Employers may still have some hesitancy because of political uncertainty,” Ms. Bauserman said. But with the Supreme Court “solidifying the place of exchanges in the marketplace, repeal will be more challenging.” ####  ##### But some observers doubt the law will be repealed. “The ACA is here to stay, even if the GOP wins the presidency,” Mr. Stover said. #### "

"Can seeing a virtual doctor be as good as the real thing?";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Voluntary Benefits";" ##### In need of a way to provide efficient, affordable health care to its employees scattered nationwide, Pitney Bowes Inc. found a solution in telemedicine. ####  ##### The e-commerce, shipping and mailing company's telemedicine portal, launched with American Well Corp. in April 2014, allows workers to visit the Boston-based provider's physicians — as well as Pitney Bowes' on-site clinicians, dietitian, pharmacist and oncology nurse for employees with cancer — through a real-time videoconference, said Mary Bradley, Shelton, Connecticut-based Pitney Bowes' director of health care strategy. ####  ##### It helps boost employee productivity and saves money for participants in Pitney Bowes' consumer-directed health plan, Ms. Bradley said. ####  ##### Employees “literally could have a virtual visit from their office,” allowing them to start recovering sooner than “if they had to wait for a physical visit,” she said. ####  ##### Like Pitney Bowes, more U.S. companies are looking to telemedicine to expand health care access and reduce employees' out-of-pocket costs. ####  ##### Last year, 22% of employers offered telemedicine services to employees, and 37% said they expected to offer telemedicine this year, according to a Towers Watson & Co. survey of employers with 1,000 or more workers. Another 34% were considering offering telemedicine in 2016 or 2017, Towers Watson said. ####  ##### And IHS Technology, a unit of IHS Inc., has projected that 7 million patients worldwide will use telehealth services in 2018, up from 350,000 in 2013. ####  ##### “There's a lot of interest and a lot of questions about what does (telemedicine) really mean to our future health care, how do employers embrace this, or should they?” said Linh Tacker, Tampa, Florida-based vice president at Aon Hewitt, who said she receives calls every week from interested employers. ####  ##### Employers tap telemedicine hoping it will reduce costly emergency room visits for noncritical cases, increase health care access and reduce absenteeism, she said. ####  ##### Telemedicine visits, which typically cost around $40, are cheaper than doctor's office visits, so they help employees in consumer-directed health plans reduce the cost burden, said Alexander Domaszewicz, Irvine, California-based principal at Mercer L.L.C. ####  ##### Telemedicine falls in line with the strategy of urgent care, giving employees another option to save money. But some health professionals and researchers question whether telemedicine measures up to in-person care. ####  ##### Telemedicine takes many forms, but employers who offer telemedicine often provide a direct-to-consumer model, where patients discuss their problem with a clinician through a secure videoconference. ####  ##### This direct-to-consumer model is “where you get the controversy,” said Dr. Lawrence Wechsler, Pittsburgh-based vice president of telemedicine and chairman of neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “This system has to be applied where it can be applied effectively.” ####  ##### In most cases, direct-to-consumer providers such as Teladoc Inc., American Well and Doctor on Demand Inc., limit treatment to conditions such as a runny nose, sore throat or simple rashes, Dr. Wechsler said. ####  ##### The doctor should “be attuned” to that fact and “recognize when something is beyond what should be taken care of” via telemedicine, he said. ####  ##### Another issue is the potential to overprescribe medications, particularly antibiotics, though he said his experience finds telemedicine prescribing rates on par with face-to-face rates. ####  ##### A May Rand Corp. study agrees. It found that patients treated for acute respiratory infections via telemedicine video sessions were as likely to be prescribed antibiotics as patients who went to the doctor's office. ####  ##### However, the study, which compared 1,700 Teladoc appointments with 64,000 in-person visits, found that 86% of telemedicine doctors prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics vs. 56% for in-person visits, which Rand said increases costs and contributes to antibiotic resistance. ####  ##### Teladoc did not respond to requests for comment. ####  ##### “There's concern by organized medicine that the (direct-to-consumer telemedicine) care may not be as good, and I myself have become aware of several cases where care was less than optimal,” said Dr. Karen S. Rheuban, Charlottesville, Virginia-based medical director of the office of telemedicine at the University of Virginia Health System. “Self-reported symptoms aren't always the best methodology.” ####  ##### Some experts say seeing a doctor you don't know could result in inefficient care. In a June statement published in the journal Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics said telemedicine should take place “within the context of the medical home.” ####  ##### “Medical care delivered by the doc who knows the patient and the team of folks working with the doc will be better than care given by someone who does not know the patient,” Dr. Bryan Burke, professor of neonatology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and member of the academy's section on telehealth, said in an email. ####  ##### He also said treating certain conditions, such as a red throat or painful urination, with antibiotics without in-person tests are practices “no reputable authority would condone.” ####  ##### But Dr. Pat Basu, Chicago-based chief medical officer at Doctor on Demand, said in-person tests are not always needed, and the company provides equal or better care. ####  ##### “The exact same thing that we would do in our offices we would do over video to make this diagnosis,” Dr. Basu said. Diagnoses are made following standards and evidence-based guidelines, or patients are referred for an in-person visit, he said. ####  ##### “About 95% of our consultations end in what we consider to be full resolution of your diagnosis,” he said. ####  ##### Other experts question whether a patient-physician relationship can be established without an in-person meeting, and some wonder whether telemedicine will be overused, reducing its cost-savings potential. ####  ##### Many experts agree more research is needed to evaluate direct-to-consumer care as it relates to in-person care. ####  ##### At the same time, 29 states already require health insurers to pay for telemedicine services, according to the American Telemedicine Association. And organizations like the American Medical Association and the Federation of State Medical Boards support telemedicine. ####  ##### “No one is going into this thinking that they are not going to deliver good care. Everyone is trying to deliver the best possible care under the circumstances,” Dr. Wechsler said. #### "
"Competition in pharmacy benefits market intensifies";"Benefits Management";"Prescription Drug Benefits";" ##### While carving out pharmacy benefits management to a specialty provider generally lowers costs for self-funded employers, those seeking such unbundled arrangements are meeting resistance from the insurers that administer their health benefit programs. ####  ##### Meanwhile, pharmacy benefit managers are  intensifying their courtship of self-funded employers as competition escalates in the PBM market after the most recent wave of mergers and UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s decision to handle pharmacy benefit administration inside, experts say (see related story). ####  ##### Today, more than half of self-funded employers contract separately for pharmacy and medical benefit administration, usually with a pharmacy benefit manager for pharmacy benefits and an insurer for medical benefits, said Scott Hengst, a pharmacy consultant at Lambertville, N.J.-based Health Strategies Group Inc. ####  ##### To keep from losing pharmacy benefits administration business, some insurers, such as Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Inc. and Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc., have partnered with PBMs to provide those services at a more competitive price than they could if they were administered in-house, he said. ####  ##### For example, WellPoint sold its PBM subsidiary NextRx to St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. in 2009 and then signed a 10-year pharmacy benefits administration contract with Express Scripts. Similarly, Aetna in 2010 entered into a 12-year contract with Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS Caremark Corp., but kept its in-house PBM to manage clinical programs, protocols and oversight of its pharmacy benefits business. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Conversely, Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth Group Inc., which had contracted for more than a decade with Medco Health Solutions Inc. to provide PBM services to its plan members, severed ties last year with the Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based Medco on the same day Medco's takeover by Express Scripts was announced. UnitedHealth is taking pharmacy benefits management back in-house under OptumRx Inc., a rebranding of the former Prescription Solutions, a PBM that UnitedHealth picked up when it acquired Cypress, Calif.-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in 2005. ####  ##### Other insurers, concerned about losing revenues and rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers for dispensing large amounts of certain drugs, are increasing the administrative-services-only fees charged for managing medical benefits if an employer attempts to contract separately with a PBM, sources said. ####  ##### “Activity regarding jacking up ASO fees if you carve out isn't new, but insurers are a little bit more aggressive now than in the past,” said David Dross, managed pharmacy practice leader for Mercer L.L.C. in Houston. He said insurers “want to keep the pharmacy business because it's a source of revenue and a source of profit.” Frequently, “they retain the rebates as part of the arrangement and then say to the plan sponsor they are using the rebates to defray the administration fee, but the rebate is a good bit larger than the defrayed administration fee,” Mr. Dross said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Allan Zimmerman, national pharmacy practice director at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York, said insurers are reluctant to unbundle the pharmacy benefit component from an ASO contract because it weakens their ability to purchase large volumes of prescription drugs at a discount. ####  ##### “The PBM contract might have some sort of component based on volume, and unbundling and allowing spinoff of significant portions of the pharmacy benefit out of their scope and influence could have an impact on the tier or discount that they get. So if they lost another 1 million lives, they might fall a tier,” he said. ####  ##### A few years ago, when Dan Pikelny, director of health benefits and productivity at Navistar Inc. in Lisle, Ill., attempted to carve out pharmacy benefits for a small group of employees Navistar attained through an acquisition, its insurer attempted to increase ASO fees. Instead, Mr. Pikelny moved the medical plan and pharmacy benefits administration away from that insurer. ####  ##### “When we tried to pull it away to consolidate under our main PBM contract, the carrier threatened to increase ASO fees by 30%. We moved both the PBM and ASO away from that carrier, consolidating it with the Navistar program,” he said. ####  ##### More recently, when bidding out separate contracts for medical and pharmacy benefits for 70,000 Navistar benefit plan members, CVS Caremark offered better pricing on a carved-out arrangement than Navistar could obtain in a bundled arrangement with its insurer, Mr. Pikelny said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Many employers, if they went to their health insurer and said they wanted to carve out prescription drugs, of course the insurer balked,” said Nadina Rosier, North American practice leader for pharmacy benefits at Towers Watson & Co. in New York. Insurers said they would have to replace the lost revenue by increasing ASO fees anywhere from 10% to sometimes double, she said. ####  ##### However, with pharmacy being the fastest-growing component of health benefits for many employers, “many self-insured employers have looked at the carve-out value proposition. On the financial side, there's the attraction of being able to negotiate more transparency and savings,” she said. ####  ##### Moreover, because PBMs specialize in pharmaceutical management, they have better track records than insurers in addressing that component of self-funded employers' rapidly escalating health benefit costs, she said. ####  ##### “You're hiring a company that only does pharmacy. By concentrating volume within a PBM, they have the best purchasing rights to negotiate the best deals with manufacturers,” said William A. Schlag, Boston-based senior vp in Willis Group Holdings P.L.C.'s human capital practice. “Second, they are able to build therapeutic resource centers with specially trained pharmacists to measure and monitor medication adherence. Health plans can do all those things. However, very few do because pharmacy is not the major part of their business.” #### "
"Pharmacy benefit managers pursue self-funded employers";"Benefits Management";"";" ##### Pharmacy benefit managers are intensifying their courtship of self-funded employers in the wake of recent industry consolidation and other developments, including a decision by  UnitedHealth Group Inc. to sever its ties with Medco Health Solutions Inc. ####  ##### Once the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based Medco lost a contract serving some 12 million members of Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth the same day St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. announced its acquisition. ####  ##### Now, UnitedHealth is providing PBM services internally via its OptumRx Inc. subsidiary, a rebranding of the former Prescription Solutions, a firm that UnitedHealth picked up when it acquired Cypress, Calif.-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in 2005. OptumRx also is competing for self-funded employer business, sources said. ####  ##### “OptumRx is capturing a lot of business,” said Susan Hayes, a principal at Pharmacy Outcomes Specialists L.L.C., a Lake Zurich, Ill.-based pharmacy benefit consulting firm. She said that UnitedHealth is taking a “write-off” on its PBM business to reduce its profit margin so it can better meet the new minimum medical-loss ratios for its insured business set under the Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act beginning this year. ####  ##### UnitedHealth did not respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### Meanwhile, Catamaran Corp., the nation's fourth-largest PBM based on prescription volume created by the merger of Lisle, Ill.-based SXC Health Solutions Corp. with Rockville, Md.-based Catalyst Health Solutions Inc., promises to be a “disruptive model” in the marketplace by offering better service and greater cost savings to self-funded employers, sources said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “PBMs are definitely going after the self-funded business, but that's not new,” said William A. Schlag, a Boston-based senior vp in Willis Group Holdings P.L.C.'s human capital practice. “There's renewed energy because of consolidation. There's increased competition in the PBM world.” ####  ##### “The PBM marketplace is a buyers' market for self-funded employers,” said Robert Kalman, a principal in Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s national pharmacy practice in Washington. “Over the past five years, there's been rapid consolidation in the PBM industry starting with CVS Inc. buying Caremark in 2007, the Express Scripts acquisitions, culminating with Medco last year to produce the largest PBM in the country with over 100 million lives. ####  ##### “With the consolidation, there has been intense competition among PBMs for self-funded employer business. To get that business, they either have to buy other PBMs or take away business in competitive bidding situations. This puts the employer in an enviable position to achieve very, very aggressive pricing and other terms,” Mr. Kalman said. #### "
"Benefits administration vendors retool to help firms comply with reporting rules";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Providers of benefits administration outsourcing services are scrambling to help employers comply with upcoming tax reporting requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but few can transmit that information directly to the IRS. ####  ##### While some human resources information system providers can perform services such as tax filing in addition to benefits administration and payroll processing, systems built solely to perform health and welfare benefits administration historically have not had such capabilities, experts say. ####  ##### Some providers are retooling to meet the new ACA reporting requirements, while others are partnering with firms that already have tax-reporting capabilities. ####  ##### JoAnne Pettijohn, a Dallas-based solutions consultant in Lockton Cos. L.L.C.'s human resource technology outsourcing practice, said while most benefit administration outsourcing pro-viders “can help employers gather the data and help prepare the reports, the filing is going to be the difficult component.” ####  ##### “Currently, the only choice is to prepare the report with all the integral data and then deliver it to the client so the employer can file it with their tax filing, but there is no electronic interface at this point,” Ms. Pettijohn said. ####  ##### “There are a lot of stand-alone ACA technology vendors that have come to the rescue, but they're not benefit administration vendors,” she said. “A lot of benefit administration vendors are partnering with these stand-alone ACA vendors, but a stand-alone benefit administration vendor may not have these capabilities.” ####  ##### Mercer L.L.C. recently introduced its Employer Shared Responsibility software that can accept data feeds from payroll systems to track hours and report who has met the 30-hour threshold for benefits eligibility, said Kerry Donoghue, Norwood, Massachusetts-based partner and health and benefits administration business leader at Mercer. ####  ##### “We can feed a file to their payroll vendor or another third party, but there's not the ability for us right now to do a tax filing,” Ms. Donoghue said. “We do something similar with the W-2 reporting.” ####  ##### Using Mercer's benefit administration outsourcing systems for tax reporting “would require us to do additional coding,” she said. “We also would have to do additional work with the IRS from a licensing perspective.” ####  ##### Similarly, Aon Hewitt provides “data files to support the filing requirement, as much of this information is on file as part of the benefits administration services we provide,” said Craig Rosenberg, the consultant's Norwalk, Connecticut-based health and welfare benefits administration practice leader. ####  ##### The files must include demographic, enrollment, cost and other information. ####  ##### “We are currently working through the approach related to the actual IRS filing and creation of tax forms,” he said, but U.S. Treasury Department guidance must be issued first. “Draft forms have been released, but filing instructions have not yet been provided.” ####  ##### Tony DeNucci, managing director of benefits outsourcing at Towers Watson & Co. in Minneapolis, said clients are asking for help with the Internal Revenue Code 6055 and 6056 reporting requirements on health insurance offered, which go into effect for the 2015 tax year. ####  ##### “That is something that we can help clients with, but we do have to modify our processes,” Mr. DeNucci said. “Under our traditional outsourcing agreement, it was not something we were contracted to do.” ####  ##### Charleston, South Carolina-based Benefitfocus Inc. announced a joint venture last fall with Equifax Workforce Solutions, a unit of Equifax Inc., to provide administration and reporting tools to determine benefit eligibility for part-time and seasonal employees, said Shandon Fowler, director of product management for marketplaces at Benefitfocus. ####  ##### “This was something that caught everybody off guard,” he said. “It was something that hadn't been done before. One of the reasons that Treasury delayed the reporting requirements was because there weren't any current systems capable of doing it.” ####  ##### Perhaps the biggest reason so many outside providers of benefits administration are ill-equipped to perform this new reporting task is that “this is tax reporting, not benefits administration,” said Ray Grove, product marketing manager at Convey Compliance Systems L.L.C., a nonwage third-party tax information reporting provider based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. “One of the things that the ACA has done is to complicate things for employers. This is very much a tax process; it just has to do with health care.” ####  ##### But “even if an employer were to use a stand-alone outsourced ACA administrator, they are still going to be dependent on eligibility and enrollment data from their benefits outsourcing vendor,” said Bruce Gillis, health and wellness practice lead at Xerox Corp. in Louisville, Kentucky. “The system of record is clearly going to be the health and welfare benefits administration system.” #### "
"ALCO Stores finds provider to help with automated health benefits enrollment";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### ALCO Stores Inc. changed benefit administration outsourcing providers this year to help it meet Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requirements that the chain of more than 200 stores provide automated enrollment to employees and extend benefits to those working 30 or more hours per week. ####  ##### As a retailer, Coppell, Texas-based ALCO Stores has a large variable-hour workforce. Benefitfocus Inc.'s HR InTouch Marketplace, used in conjunction with the ACA Management Platform from Equifax Workforce Solutions, gave ALCO the tools it needed to measure and track the eligibility of its workers as required by ACA's employer mandate, Shatana Allen, director of human resources at ALCO Stores, said in statement. ####  ##### “This was the comprehensive solution we needed to improve employee engagement and be more strategic in our benefits administration,” she said. “We are excited to roll this out starting with open enrollment for our variable-hour workers in November.” ####  ##### Such provider switching has surged in the past several years, mostly in response to ACA, according to a report by Everest Global Inc., a Dallas-based advisory and research firm. ####  ##### “Buyers felt threatened from compliance-related issues and hence switched service providers to avoid severe penalties,” according to the report. Moreover, “over the last few years, the pricing for (benefits administration outsourcing) has declined and buyers either renegotiate the existing contracts or switch providers to get more value for the money spent.” ####  ##### Though Everest Global expects such switching to decline this year from its peak in 2012-2013, it likely will remain higher “due to the market being more dynamic and difficult in terms of more complex requirements” because of ACA, Arkadev Basak, practice director at Everest Global, said in an email response to questions from Business Insurance. #### "
"Employers want unbiased advice on private health care exchanges";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### As private health insurance exchanges evolve, some benefits consultants are trying to distinguish themselves as unbiased advisers in a marketplace dominated by companies offering advisory services alongside their own branded exchange products. ####  ##### Months of conversations with current and prospective clients recently led Pacific Resources Benefits Advisors L.L.C. to launch a specialized consulting practice designed to provide employers with independent, third-party guidance on private exchanges, company executives say. ####  ##### “A good number of employers raised the issue of consulting objectivity and bias where companies were marketing and selling an exchange platform,” said Jody Hunter, Resources Benefits' Chicago-based vice president of marketplace solutions. ####  ##### Additionally, findings of the company's February employer survey about private health insurance exchanges revealed significant interest in independent advisory services. ####  ##### Although its parent company, insurance brokerage Brown & Brown Inc., launched a proprietary exchange platform last year, Mr. Hunter said that product is not included in the consultant's assessments of exchange platforms. ####  ##### “The marketing for the Brown & Brown product is really focused on employers with under 500 employees, and that's not a market segment that we focus on,” Mr. Hunter said. “We're focused on the segment that, on average, totals about 10,000 or more employees per client.” ####  ##### Several other consultants, including PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P., Laurus Strategies and Sibson Consulting, also have elected to not develop in-house private exchange products and instead have launched exchange consulting practices. ####  ##### “We felt that if we had our own exchange product that we had to sell, it would put us in an untenable position and prevent us from being as objective as we want to be,” said Nancy Scola Lombaer, a Chicago-based partner at Laurus Strategies. ####  ##### Benefits brokers and consultants with considerable investments in their respective exchange platforms — including Towers Watson & Co. and Aon Hewitt — said they also provide clients with unbiased advice on private exchanges, at least in the initial phases of an employer's inquiry. ####  ##### “At that early stage, the relationship that we've built with clients as trusted advisers still holds, and we generally haven't had any issues or questions around objectivity from clients,” said Jim Winkler, Aon Hewitt's chief innovation officer of health and benefits in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### However, some private exchange providers agreed that independent assessments can be valuable to their clients, particularly when employers seek comparisons of external exchange offerings. ####  ##### We've been pretty clear in making the point that any company that owns an exchange really shouldn't be in the business of evaluating which exchange makes sense for an employer, because you can't really be objective in that evaluation,” said David Ostendorf, chief health care actuary at Towers Watson in Milwaukee. “That's something that almost always needs to be done by an objective third party.” ####  ##### Other benefits brokers, including Lockton Cos. L.L.C. and Crystal & Company, also have positioned themselves as independent advisers on private exchanges, taking the position that their limited engagement in the exchange marketplace affords them greater objectivity than their competitors. ####  ##### “Once you start making financial investments into certain ex-changes, I think it changes the mindset of the companies providing these services to the extent that they're focusing on generating a return on their investment,” said Michael Grant, New York-based executive managing director of employee benefits services at Crystal & Company. ####  ##### One reason independent consultants cite for employers' demand for unbiased advisory services is the heightened attention private exchanges have drawn from em-ployers' chief financial officers and other senior executives, particularly due to the economic and administrative complexity of switching to an exchange. ####  ##### “Even if the employer's human resources or benefits manager has a long-standing relationship with their broker or consultant, because you now have the CFO or another senior executive involved in these discussions about private exchanges, there's a greater emphasis on the need for an independent view of the marketplace,” said Barbara Gniewek, a New York-based principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. ####  ##### Independent consultants say not offering proprietary exchanges  makes it easier to collect detailed product and pricing information from multiple exchange owners. ####  ##### “That's one of the reasons we came out pretty aggressively to say we're not building an ex-change, because we wanted to remove that barrier,” said Christopher Calvert, New York-based senior vice president and health practice leader at Sibson Consulting, a division of Segal Group Inc. “Since we've done that, the private exchange providers have become much more willing to discuss the details of their products.” ####  ##### Going forward, most benefits service providers said they expect more companies to offer independent consulting focused exclusively on private exchanges, especially given the speed with which marketplace conditions shift. ####  ##### “We saw a similar dynamic unfold with the advent of benefits administration outsourcing, and I think the exchange marketplace is evolving in the exact same way,” Mr. Ostendorf said. “Over time, it will become very unusual for even large organizations to go out and make this decision without a third-party search consultant helping to guide the process.” #### "
"Direct contracts with medical providers help self-insured employers control costs";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### A growing number of self-insured employers are bypassing health plan administrators and contracting directly with providers in efforts to limit the increases in their health care costs. ####  ##### Direct contracting isn't new, but more employers are considering it among other cost-cutting measures, and many providers are better prepared to run the numbers. ####  ##### According to Aon Hewitt's “2014 Health Care Survey,” conducted between December 2013 and January of this year, 11% of employers are engaging in some form of direct health care provider and service contracting during this plan year, and 28% expect to do so in the next three to five years. ####  ##### “Having that direct contract opens the door to discussions about cost and performance in ways that employers who are just doing business with health plans ... never see,” said Donna Marshall, executive director of the Colorado Business Group on Health in Lakewood, Colorado. ####  ##### Salt Lake City-based researcher and consultant Leavitt Partners L.L.C. predicted in a May research brief that “employer-provider relationships are likely to proliferate” in the next several years as health care costs “continue to escalate.” ####  ##### William DeMarco, president and CEO of DeMarco & Associates Inc., a Rockford, Illinois-based health care consultant, said the health care reform law is stoking hospital-physician consolidation, which also is driving up costs, leading to employers' “renewed interest” in direct contracting. ####  ##### Many employers also are unhappy with the cost and outcomes data they receive from their health plan administrators, he said. ####  ##### “They'd like to know, well, how did this person end up in the hospital?” Mr. DeMarco said. Few health insurers and third-party administrators provide data linking a physician's diagnosis to a hospital's cost and the outcome of the patient's care, he said. ####  ##### Greg Mansur, a partner in the health and welfare consulting practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Los Angeles, said the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's looming excise tax on high-cost health plans, scheduled to go into effect in 2018, and an aging workforce also are increasing the pressure on employers to use cost-control opportunities such as direct contracting. ####  ##### “Doctors and hospitals almost expect a direct contracting overture,” said A. Michael La Penna, founder and principal of health care industry consultant The La Penna Group Inc. in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ####  ##### Whether employers pay a monthly fee per member or a bundled rate, significant savings can be achieved, experts say. Some employers are negotiating narrow networks and changing plans to persuade employees to use the network for some or all of their care. And in suburban Denver, the City of Arvada, Colorado, already is seeing encouraging results through its recent primary care contract with Paladina Health L.L.C. ####  ##### Most employers are looking to save 5% to 10% of their health care spend, Mr. Mansur said. Some providers promise even greater savings, he said, cautioning employers to carefully scrutinize those deals. ####  ##### Intel Corp., the world's largest computer-chip maker, struck a deal in 2011 with Presbyterian Healthcare Services in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to serve  3,500 employees and their dependents at its manufacturing facility in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. ####  ##### Under the value-based agreement, rolled out in 2013, Intel pays the organization, which has 100 clinics and eight hospitals in the state, a monthly fee per member, and the two organizations share in any risks or savings above or below a specified target. Intel projected savings of $8 million to $10 million through 2017 as a result of the direct contracting arrangement, structured as an accountable care organization. ####  ##### AtlantiCare, an Atlantic City, New Jersey, health care organization, is negotiating direct contracts with local employers through its ACO. It rolled out the network to its own 8,500 employees and dependents in 2011. Monthly costs per member that had been projected to increase by 7% in 2012 actually decreased by 4%, and costs remained flat in 2013, said Steven Blumberg, senior vice president of AtlantiCare Health Solutions, the ACO. ####  ##### Some employers are seeking direct contracts for high-cost care, such as heart surgery or hip replacements, consultants say. ####  ##### When Greenville, South Carolina-based Michelin North America Inc. examined its health care spending, musculoskeletal-related expenses ranked No. 1, said Chris Mattern, the tire maker's former manager of worksite health and wellness programs and now the company's facility manager. To manage that expense, the company signed with Tallahassee, Florida-based Integrated Mechanical Care, whose clinicians follow strict musculoskeletal care guidelines. ####  ##### Michelin declined to discuss its results, but Integrated Medical Care President Chad Gray said employers can reduce total musculoskeletal spending by 40% to 60%, depending on plan design, employee communications and other variables. #### "
"Angela Braly steps down as WellPoint CEO";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Wellpoint";" ##### Correcting the management missteps and anemic earnings that led to last week's abrupt departure of Angela Braly as president and CEO of WellPoint Inc. must be a top priority for her successor, analysts said. ####  ##### Ms. Braly, the Indianapolis-based managed care company's chief executive since 2007, stepped down last week amid growing pressure from investors dissatisfied with the company's financial performance. ####  ##### In a statement, WellPoint said it is actively searching for a successor. ####  ##### John Cannon, an executive vice president and WellPoint's general counsel, corporate secretary and chief public affairs officer, has been named interim president and CEO. Jackie Ward, the company's lead director, will replace Ms. Braly as a nonexecutive chair of WellPoint's board of directors. ####  ##### In the statement, Ms. Ward said the board stands behind strategic decisions made during Ms. Braly's five-year tenure, but felt that “now is the right time for a leadership change.” ####  ##### “Our board continues to believe that time will prove the wisdom of potentially transformative actions taken under Angela's leadership,” Ms. Ward said. “We believe the remaining executive team is dynamic and strong, with great potential to drive WellPoint's future success.” ####  ##### A WellPoint spokes-woman said Ms. Braly did not plan to comment on her departure from the company. ####  ##### Analysts said overly aggressive pricing on WellPoint's commercial group lines, poor benefit plan designs in certain segments of its Medicare Advantage business and lingering integration issues from its 2004 merger with Anthem Inc. were among issues troubling investors the past two years. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “There had been pressure from investors for this to happen for some time,” said David Windley, a Nashville, Tenn.-based managing director at Jefferies & Co. Inc. ####  ##### “Under Ms. Braly's watch, there had been some underwriting mistakes and missteps in the operations,” he said. “There was a belief that the company was underearning and needed fresh leadership.” ####  ##### Analysts said the final catalyst for the leadership change likely was WellPoint's most recent earnings report, which noted a 7.7% drop in first-half 2012 profits, to $1.5 billion. First-half revenue increased just 2.7% over prior-year results, as WellPoint's enrollments dropped 1.9% to 33.5 million from a year earlier, including 169,000 commercial segment members. ####  ##### “We've actually been pretty vocal about leadership at WellPoint,” said Alex Morozov, global health care equity research director at Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. “We've called them out for a number of execution mishaps, so we feel like this announcement supports our positive take on the company but negative take on the management team.” ####  ##### In a July conference call, Ms. Braly and other WellPoint executives attributed disappointing first-half results to unexpected membership losses and spikes in medical cost trends and utilization rates, notably in outpatient care, physician visits and specialty pharmaceuticals. ####  ##### However, analysts were skeptical of the company's explanation, noting that costs and utilization rates didn't appear to affect most of WellPoint's competitors to the same extent. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “They sort of went overboard in saying that they were just the first ones to get hit with these trends and that they were trying to be as transparent as possible with the market,” Mr. Windley said. “When you look at the things that they discussed, and then look at the things that some of the other insurers were saying, you see that they're really not first.” ####  ##### The day after announcing Ms. Braly's departure, WellPoint's stock price rose more than 8% over the previous day's close. ####  ##### “We remain bullish on the stock, and we continue to recommend shares,” Mr. Morozov said. “WellPoint has definitely had some issues in the past, but it's also one of the strongest operators in the space. It's an exciting business, but it's been severely mismanaged.” ####  ##### Analysts said questions surrounding WellPoint's strategy going forward likely would remain unanswered until a successor is named. ####  ##### “A lot of investors wanted this leadership change, so they see this news as a step in the right direction, but it's only one step,” Mr. Windley said. “In my mind, the next leadership announcement is really important.” ####  ##### In a note to investors, Steve Zaharuk, senior vice president at New York-based Moody's Investors Services Inc., called the leadership disruption “somewhat troublesome” at a time when WellPoint is attempting to close its acquisition of Amerigroup Corp., preparing for the full implementation of the health care reform law and addressing the rising medical cost trends it cited in its second-quarter earnings report. ####  ##### “While the recent and very public reports of calls for Ms. Braly's resignation were a distraction for the company, the current leadership uncertainty is unsettling during this crucial period for WellPoint,” Mr. Zaharuk said. “At best, it will likely be several months before a permanent CEO is named and begins to address WellPoint's strategic direction and operational issues.” #### "
"Cultural differences, insurance laws challenge global wellness strategies";"Benefits Management";"";" ##### American employers hoping to expand their workplace wellness strategies globally must account for variations in the needs and resources of their foreign-based employees to effectively design, implement and monitor wellness programs overseas. ####  ##### While a slight majority of large U.S.-based employers provide workplace wellness and employee health management programs on a global scale, several factors can impede an employer from establishing a truly global program, experts say. ####  ##### Fifty-one percent of U.S.-based multinational firms applied a global strategy to their employee health management programs in 2013, according to a survey of more than 1,000 employers in 37 countries by Secaucus, New Jersey-based Buck Consultants at Xerox. ####  ##### “Companies that take this on really have their work cut out for them,” said David Ratcliffe, a Washington-based principal at Buck Consultants. “We've seen the prevalence of wellness programs in other countries increase generally over the last several years, but there are still a lot of barriers to really rolling out a global wellness strategy.” ####  ##### For U.S.-based employers, experts say applying a workplace wellness strategy globally may be especially challenging, as health insurance is sponsored at least in part, if not in whole, by the government in most other industrialized countries. ####  ##### “In the U.S., employers obviously have a vested interest in the health and wellness of their employees from a financial perspective in that they're the ones paying for their health care,” said Elizabeth Greenbaum, a Hong Kong-based assistant director of the Global Business Group on Health. “Outside of the United States, employers for the most part aren't incurring the medical costs associated with poor employee health care, so they're not driven to improve employee health from that perspective.” ####  ##### “In general, the U.S. mindset on workplace wellness isn't going to work,” said Thomas Dolan, Boston-based senior vice president of global employee benefits solutions at Willis North America Inc. “In fact, ""well-being' is probably the more widely applicable term being used globally, as opposed to wellness. What we're seeing now is a new focus among employers on adopting a global well-being framework that's configurable and adaptable to local environments.” ####  ##### The word “well-being” is understood in most countries to encompass more than employees' physical health, i.e. their mental and emotional health, Mr. Dolan said. ####  ##### Rather than designing wellness programs around cost-reduction goals, experts say employers' workplace wellness programs most frequently gain traction with managers and employees in foreign countries when they are designed to address elements of the organizations' local or global competitiveness, particularly their value proposition as employers. ####  ##### “Outside the U.S., these programs tend to focus on employee engagement and talent,” said Dr. Lorna Friedman, a New York-based partner in Mercer L.L.C.'s global health management practice. “What we're hearing from senior human resource professionals and other executives globally is that they have a talent shortage and a skills gap, and that healthy populations and work environments are an imperative part of the human capital dialogue.” ####  ##### Once global wellness objectives are established, experts say employers will need to consult locally with designated leaders within their organization, health care providers and licensed wellness providers to design and communicate a suite of culturally and demographically relevant wellness activities. ####  ##### “You need a flexible framework with a set of adaptable pillars,” said Francis Coleman, director of international consulting at Towers Watson & Co. in Los Angeles. “For example, one pillar might be stress management, another could be physical activity and another might be smoking cessation. From that, you let each of your local groups select the most appropriate set of pillars for their workforce, depending on the specific issues that are most prevalent amongst their population.” ####  ##### U.S. employers should pay especially close attention to international data privacy laws, experts say. In the European Union, employee health information is classified as sensitive personal data and subject to enhanced restrictions regarding its collection, retention and processing by employers. ####  ##### E.U. member states — as well as nations that include Argentina, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland — also prohibit private companies from exporting personal data to countries that do not meet the E.U. privacy standard. ####  ##### “When it comes to sensitive health data, you're going to need to be extra vigilant,” said Christopher Walter, a London-based partner at law firm Covington & Burling L.L.P. “Privacy must be the top consideration.” ####  ##### Employers establishing wellness programs overseas also must consider local employment regulations. Specifically, Mr. Walter said, employers should consider whether local regulators might view a particular wellness activity or initiative as being indirectly discriminatory for one or more protected classes of employee, potentially leading to civil actions or fines. ####  ##### On the other hand, U.S.-based employers may find some countries' laws to be more relaxed than American statutes. In many Latin American and European Union member states, Mr. Walter said, employers are generally not liable for indirectly discriminating against a certain group of employees if the company can demonstrate that the action in question serves a proportionately greater company objective when compared with its negative effect on the individuals alleging discrimination. ####  ##### By contrast, U.S. laws generally require employers accused of direct or indirect discriminatory acts to demonstrate both a legitimate objective for the offending act and that it was the least restrictive means of meeting that objective. ####  ##### How nondiscrimination rules are applied to workplace health management and wellness programs is largely unknown, Mr. Walter said, as actual cases addressing the issue have been rare within the last few years. ####  ##### “Over time, I suspect we might begin to see some of those issues teased out,” he said. “It will be important for employers to think carefully about the potential impacts.” #### "
"Q&A: James Klein, American Benefits Council";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### For years, employers have been grappling with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as reform law provisions took effect and regulations were published. At the same time, federal lawmakers, especially Republicans in the House of Representatives, have launched drives to modify and, in some cases, repeal the law. In a recent conversation with Business Insurance Editor-at-Large Jerry Geisel, James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, a Washington-based employer benefits lobbying organization, discusses the likelihood of further changes to the law. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: Many measures have been introduced in Congress that would amend the ACA. The one that has gone the furthest — to determine if employers are complying with a provision that will require them to offer coverage to full-time employees or pay a stiff penalty — would change the definition of a full-time employees to those working an average of 40 hours a week from the current 30-hour a week standard. What is the likelihood of that proposal winning approval? ####  ##### A: There is no question that changing the definition of who is considered a full-time employee would be welcomed by many employers, who traditionally have not used a 30-hour weekly standard. The likelihood of that happening while possible — there is some bipartisan interest in it — is challenging. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the change from 30 to 40 hours would cost the federal government nearly $74 billion over 10 years. Congressional Demo-crats undoubtedly would try to find a way to require Republicans to pay for that revenue loss. Certainly, though, if Republicans were to take control of the Senate, the likelihood of that legislation going forward does increase. ####  ##### Q: What other changes would employers like to see made to the law? ####  ##### A: First, repeal or significant modification of the so-called Cadillac plan tax. If it can't be repealed, then creating a safe harbor so that employers can design around it. And more realistic indexing would be helpful. Second, the American Benefits Council has proposed establishing a mechanism so employers could fund health reimbursement arrangements, or similar accounts, so that individuals could purchase coverage in public exchanges. And third, repeal of the automatic enrollment requirement. Automatic enrollment has worked wonderfully in the retirement plan context, but in the health care context, where Americans are required to have coverage, it really is not needed. And, it can result in individuals being made ineligible for subsidies if they wanted to obtain coverage through public exchanges. ####  ##### Q: A very visible benefit of the ACA has been the decrease in the number of uninsured. From an employer perspective, what have been other positive aspects of the law? ####  ##### A: The employer community has always sought to address the uninsured problem. So the reduction in the number of uninsured is a positive. If the exchanges work, there is a possibility of repealing or modifying COBRA. We already have seen the public exchange become a venue for coverage for early retirees. Arguably, the law has created a better individual insurance market place where people can obtain coverage notwithstanding their health care conditions. ####  ##### Q: What have been the negative aspects of the law? ####  ##### A: The administrative demands are enormous. American Benefits Council members already provide excellent coverage. Yet the law requires them to jump through numerous hoops. On the other hand, small employers, where the level of coverage is of course the lowest, are exempt from the law. So, there is an inherent contradiction why should large employers, who are already providing excellent coverage, be required to take all these steps? Also, the rules implementing the law have made it much more difficult for employers to use outcomes-based wellness programs, which is a high priority for corporate America. #### "

"Private health insurance exchanges gain traction with employers";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Aon Hewitt, Towers Watson";" ##### For decades, the way employers offered health insurance coverage to their employees and retirees changed little. Now more and more companies are moving to a new health benefits delivery model using private health insurance exchanges. ####  ##### Under the old model, employers, often with the assistance of consultants, brokers and agents, decided the insurers from which they would purchase coverage, the number and types of health plans they would offer employees, and how much they would contribute toward the cost of the coverage. ####  ##### In addition, employers were deeply involved in plan administration, arranging and holding open enrollments for employees to choose one of the plans offered. ####  ##### By contrast, with private insurance exchanges, employees and retirees select from a variety of health care plans and designs, with the employer's role largely limited to deciding how much of the premium it will pay. ####  ##### While the move to private exchanges is not entirely new, there has been an accelerated shift in the past year, said Michael Thompson, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### In the past few weeks, big and well-known industry-leading employers, including IBM Corp. and Walgreen Co., have disclosed that, starting next year, their employees or retirees will choose health care plans offered by insurers participating in private exchanges. One exchange alone — the one unveiled a year ago by Aon Hewitt — has seen the number of participating employers leap sixfold to 18 from three, with total enrollment more than doubling to about 600,000. ####  ##### Other private exchanges also are growing quickly. Eleven employers with 400,000 employees and dependents have signed up with an exchange offered by Buck Consultants L.L.C. that will start next year. Mercer L.L.C. said nine employers with 35,000 enrollees have signed up for its new exchange, with an announcement expected soon that additional employers have opted for the exchange. ####  ##### And OneExchange Retiree, a Towers Watson & Co. exchange offering coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees, has seen the number of clients jump nearly 50% this year alone to 300. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The recent growth spurt may be just the beginning. “In the future, exchanges will be the standard business model” for providing coverage, said Alan Cohen, co-founder and chief strategy officer in New York with Liazon Corp., which operates the Bright Choices private insurance exchange. ####  ##### “It is reasonable to expect that the overall marketplace will double every year for the next five years,” said Ken Sperling, Aon Hewitt national strategy leader in Norwalk, Conn. ####  ##### Others are more cautious in their growth predictions. ####  ##### “It might be premature to give some sort of projection that this is going to be the model of the future. What we can say is that there seems to be great interest from corporate America,” said Mercer President and CEO Julio Portalatin in New York. ####  ##### That corporate interest in private exchanges is being driven by several factors, according to employers who have signed up: ####  ##### • A desire to give their employees or retirees more health care plan options. ####  ##### “Choice was an important factor,” said Steve Heckert, vice president of human resources in Clearwater, Fla., for GFI Software. The company offers employees up to six health care plans, compared with just one plan previously, through the Bright Choices exchange. “Employees are able to select a health plan that works for their pocketbook with coverage appropriate for them.” ####  ##### A spokesman for Deerfield, Ill.-based Walgreen said, “We are trying to provide more options for our very diverse workforce that covers 240,000 team members across all 50 states. With more options, employees can choose a plan that is more personalized for their health care needs.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### About 35% of Walgreen employees are single and under age 30, and “with the flexibility of our new program, they can choose a plan that provides the kind of coverage they need — 100% of their preventive care with premiums as low as $5 a month for a high-deductible plan,” the spokesman said. ####  ##### Walgreen employees will be able to choose from up to 25 different plans offered by the five insurers participating in the Aon Hewitt exchange. This year, employees could choose from only two insurers who each offered two plans. ####  ##### • Reduction in overhead. ####  ##### “For clients, we take on all the contracting and negotiating,” said Sherri Bockhorst, national practice leader of health exchange solutions for Buck Consultants. ####  ##### “In an environment where HR staff resources are severely constrained, the ability to go to an exchange and say, ""You handle compliance. You handle employees' questions,”"" is a big resource saver for employers, Mercer's Mr. Portalatin said. ####  ##### Employers agree. “That allows us to concentrate on meeting the many other needs of our people,” said Al Rapp, vice president of corporate health care in Atlanta with United Parcel Service Inc., which has offered health care coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees through an Aon Hewitt exchange since 2012. ####  ##### • Making employer costs more predictable. ####  ##### When employers adopt the exchange model, they typically set a fixed premium contribution amount they will pay. Previously, “the amount of the annual benefit rate increases drove our benefits strategy more than we liked. With the exchange delivery mechanism, we're able to decide on our strategy and associated budget independent of the rate increases,” GFI Software's Mr. Heckert said. #### "
"Quad/Graphics drops direct health care contracting, switches to Anthem network";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Quad/Graphics Inc., a longtime national leader in direct health care contracting, is canceling its roughly 400 medical provider contracts in Wisconsin and shifting to Anthem Inc.'s national network effective Jan. 1, 2015. ####  ##### The Sussex, Wisconsin-based commercial printer will save “millions of dollars” a year by switching to Anthem's network for all health care services for its employees, said John Neuberger, Quad's director of client partnerships. ####  ##### The move is the opposite of the trend among self-insured employers, in which 11% already contract directly with providers for various health care services and 28% are considering doing so in the next three to five years to reduce costs, according to an Aon Hewitt survey released earlier this year. ####  ##### Quad offers its 6,200 Wisconsin employees a narrow network of doctors, hospitals and ancillary providers. ####  ##### Many directly contracted health care relationships go back 15 years, with pricing that historically beat national insurers, Mr. Neuberger said. But as health plans have expanded their presence in the state, their discounts have improved, he said. ####  ##### “We did get good pricing, but in large markets like this, I'm learning it's just hard to compete with the big guys,” Mr. Neuberger said. ####  ##### Quad conducted a request for proposals in the first half of the year to compare its direct contract pricing with national insurers'. By summer, it decided to go with Anthem's proposal. ####  ##### The new package replaces about 400 direct contracts with providers covering a broad range of services. ####  ##### “We were buying everything, and that was kind of the challenge of renegotiating all of those things,” Mr. Neuberger said. ####  ##### Gerald Frye, president of The Benefit Services Group Inc., an employee benefits consultant in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, said the rise of accountable care organizations under the federal health care reform law, the growth of health insurance exchanges and the emergence of new health-system partnerships in the state means “you're going to see dramatic purchasing pattern changes” as insurers offer new products and target different markets, and providers align to deliver value-based care. ####  ##### Quad's decision “is not abnormal at all” given the changing dynamics, Mr. Frye said. ####  ##### A. Michael La Penna, founder and a principal at Grand Rapids, Michigan-based health industry consultant The La Penna Group Inc., said if Anthem came along with better pricing, “it was because Quad set a standard that Anthem had to achieve.” ####  ##### But A.J. Lester, president of the Houston-based direct contracting consultant A.J. Lester & Associates Inc., questioned whether large managed care companies' discounts offset administrative fees and other costs of doing business with commercial insurers. ####  ##### Quad declined to discuss specifics of its deal with Anthem. ####  ##### Quad, which has about 25,000 employees at 70 facilities in North America, Europe and Latin America, dropped its rental network and direct contracts with providers outside of Wisconsin about four years ago and shifted to a national U.S. network with Anthem. ####  ##### The printing company also is growing by acquisition, including the May purchase of Waseca, Minnesota-based Brown Printing Co. and the February purchase of Woburn, Massachusetts-based UniGraphic Inc. ####  ##### “We're in 35 states now, so to go out and develop direct contracts is kind of impractical,” Mr. Neuberger said. ####  ##### He insists that Quad remains committed to maintaining a dialogue with quality medical providers in Wisconsin and, if possible, selectively contracting with them. ####  ##### “While we're getting out of the network contracting business, we're not getting out of the provider-employer relationships business,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Neuberger expects disruption of existing patient-provider relationships of no more than 1% to 2% since employees will have access to a broader provider network. ####  ##### Health plan members may continue to receive primary care through clinics operated by the company's QuadMed subsidiary, which still has outside clients. ####  ##### Quad's priority in the next year will be steering patients to high-value hospitals, specialists and other providers within Anthem's network, Mr. Neuberger said. #### "
"Labor, self-insurance group align on health care benefits";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### WASHINGTON — The Self-Insurance Institute of America Inc. plans to continue cooperating with organized labor in pursuit of common goals, according to the SIIA's president and CEO. ####  ##### The Simpsonville, South Carolina-based SIIA has traditionally worked with business organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Now “we're doing more outreach” to organized labor, said SIIA President and CEO Mike Ferguson. ####  ##### He noted that organized labor generally has better relations with Democratic lawmakers than business does during a panel discussion on defending the self-insurance industry at SIIA's annual conference in Washington last week. ####  ##### In an interview after the discussion, Mr. Ferguson said many union members are receiving health benefits under multiemployer Taft-Hartley plans that use stop-loss insurance. Some states, however, have targeted the use of stop-loss insurance by self-funded employers. Mr. Ferguson said that many of SIIA's members' are business partners of Taft-Hartley plans. ####  ##### A multiemployer plan is a collectively bargained plan maintained by more than one employer, usually within the same or related industries, and a labor union. These plans are often referred to as “Taft-Hartley plans.” ####  ##### “We're trying to demonstrate that this isn't just a private employer issue,” said Mr. Ferguson. “It's a broadening of our coalition.” ####  ##### “How often do you see business and labor line up on the same side?” he asked. ####  ##### “Stop-loss is crucial for protecting efficient, quality health care coverage for millions of workers and their families,” Edward Smith, president and CEO of Washington-based insurer Ullico Inc., which provides life and health insurance for unions and group plans, said in an email. “Working with the SIIA on this issue is a win-win — it strengthens the voices of union members whose health care coverage is protected by stop-loss.” ####  ##### During the panel discussion, Jerry Castelloe, chairman of the SIIA government relations committee, said numerous issues affecting self-insurance have arisen in the past few years. For example, he also noted that state regulators are showing considerable interest in regulating stop-loss insurance. ####  ##### On the federal level, SIIA has commented on so-called “Cadillac tax” health care regulations, he said. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act calls for imposing a 40% excise tax on the portion of premiums above $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage beginning in coverage year 2018. Mr. Castelloe said SIIA's comments have dealt with such questions as how a benefit potentially subject to the tax would be valued, what plans would be included and who would ultimately be responsible for paying the tax. ####  ##### Also on the federal level, SIIA is focusing on passing the Self-Insurance Protection Act, which has been introduced in both houses of Congress. The act would amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code to exclude coverage of certain medical stop-loss insurance obtained by sponsors of self-insured group health plans from the definition of health insurance. ####  ##### ERISA pre-empts states from mandating the content of self-funded benefit plans. In addition, self-funded benefit plans are exempt from many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### “We continue to have engagements with Congress,” said Mr. Castelloe, urging conference attendees to visit their members of Congress to discuss the measure. ####  ##### Bob Tierney, chairman of the Self-Insurance PAC board of trustees, picked up on the theme of the importance of personal contact with lawmakers. He said that when a group of SIIA members visits a lawmaker, it's important to have someone from that lawmaker's state in the room. ####  ##### “SIPAC gives SIIA the vehicle to strengthen its voice on the federal and state level,” said Mr. Tierney. “It's really where policy and politics meet.” He added that the political action committee has raised $40,000 this year and “we're likely to increase that.” ####  ##### John Eggertsen, an attorney with Eggertsen Consulting P.C. in Ann Arbor, Michigan, noted that there “really haven't been that many cases in the past couple of years” dealing with ERISA. ####  ##### But SIIA is involved in a case in which a federal appeals court decision upheld a Michigan law that imposes a 1% tax on paid health care claims. ####  ##### Under that law, revenue generated by the tax, which is used to help fund the state's Medicaid program, is paid by health insurers offering fully insured plans and by third-party claims administrators in the case of self-insured plans. ####  ##### SIIA argues that the tax is barred by an ERISA provision that pre-empts state and local laws and rules that relate to employee benefit plans and is seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the case. #### "
"Washington State lawmakers urge IRS to ease direct primary plan regulations";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Lawmakers from the state of Washington are asking federal regulators to allow employers to offer direct primary care plans in conjunction with health savings account-qualified high-deductible health plans. ####  ##### Currently, employers can pair direct primary care plans, which are usually paid on a per-member-per-month basis and provide the full range of primary and preventive care services, only with HDHPs that do not have HSAs because DPC plans are considered “health plans” under Section 223(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits HSA account holders with HDHPs from having a second “health plan.” ####  ##### But the lawmakers maintain these arrangements should be treated as “qualified medical expenses,” under IRS rules governing HSAs to comply with provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act facilitating the creation of “direct primary care medical homes.” ####  ##### In a June 17 letter sent to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray and Rep. Jim McDermott, all Democrats representing the state of Washington, sought a ruling that payments made for DPC plans be treated as “qualified medical expenses” under IRS rules. ####  ##### “Direct primary care medical homes are not insurance,” states the letter, quoting from March 12, 2012, final regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services relating to the treatment of direct primary care medical homes in health insurance exchanges. ####  ##### “We understand that Section 223(c) of the Internal Revenue Code does prohibit HSA holders from having a second health plan,” the letter states. “However, it appears that the IRS has not updated policy to inform employers that DPC medical homes, as noted in the ACA, are not health plans.” ####  ##### “If you take a bronze plan, you can often pair that with a DPC plan on an exchange, and it would be perfectly compatible with the ACA mandates,” said Dr. Samir Qamar, CEO of MedLion, a privately held direct primary care provider based in Las Vegas, and a member of the Direct Primary Care Coalition, which is also lobbying Congress to enact changes to either the ACA or the U.S. tax code to allow employers to purchase DPC plans in conjunction with HSA-qualified HDHPs. However, under current IRS rules, HDHP plan members cannot also have an HSA under such pairing arrangements, he noted. ####  ##### “The letter is seeking to make DPC plans exempt from insurance regulations,” Dr. Qamar said, because “direct primary care is not insurance.” Such a change would also allow employees to use HSA funds to pay for DPC plans on a pretax basis, he said. #### "
"As millennials dominate the workforce, benefit focus shifts to student loans";"Benefits Management";"Voluntary Benefits";" ##### As millennials have become the majority in the U.S. workforce, some employers are trying to keep student debt from threatening the work environment by helping their millennial workers learn to balance loan payments with saving for the future. ####  ##### Student loan debt adds to financial stress that can plague employees' productivity and lead to health issues and higher medical costs for employers, experts say. It also makes it harder for workers to contribute to the company retirement plan, potentially delaying their retirement. ####  ##### “It's definitely an employer issue,” said Heather Tredup, Chicago-based partner of retirement communications at Aon Hewitt. “Employers spend a lot of money to provide benefits to their employees ... but when there is a barrier to saving, such as credit card (debt) or debt management, that means that employees may not be getting the full advantage of the benefit that is available to them.” ####  ##### Outstanding student loans total more than $1.2 trillion. About 70% of 2014 college graduates had student loan debt, with an average of $28,950 per borrower, according to the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success. ####  ##### The issue looks to grow, as millennials surpassed Generation X in the first quarter of this year to become the largest cohort in the U.S. workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. ####  ##### Still, only 3% of employers help pay their employees' student loan debt, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. ####  ##### Some employers are tackling the problem aggressively. ####  ##### New York-based professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. said in September that it will contribute $1,200 a year for up to six years toward employees' student loans. Others are helping employees refinance the loans or providing tuition subsidies to those in school. ####  ##### Sensing a lucrative market, benefit startups aimed at helping employers alleviate millennials' financial burdens are appearing. ####  ##### Gradifi Inc., a Boston-based firm partnering with PwC, helps employers make contributions toward workers' student loan debt, as does Santa Monica, California-based Tuition.io Inc. San Francisco-based startup Social Finance Inc. partners with employers to provide student loan refinancing to employees. ####  ##### But benefits experts say less expensive methods can be just as effective. ####  ##### Most often, employers offer financial education through videos, webinars and financial planner meetings to address issues millennials might face, such as budgeting, Ms. Tredup said. ####  ##### “The focus tends to be on how do you create a budget, how do you live within your budget, and if you're living beyond your budget — so maybe you're experiencing more debt issues today — how do you start to address those?” she said. ####  ##### At Armonk, New York-based IBM, employees are offered free one-on-one counseling on whatever financial issues they face. The subject “can range anywhere from your health care plan, looking at how much should I be contributing to my 401(k), what should my investment strategy look like in that plan, looking at student loan debt and consolidation,” said Kori Weber-Parker, Franklin, Wisconsin-based director of benefits at IBM. ####  ##### IBM also helps employees consolidate their student loans through a third party at a small discount, she said. “When you have a stressful environment at home, you then carry that in over to your work, and it does impact productivity,” Ms. Weber-Parker said. “So if we can help our employees relieve some of that stress around their financials and improve the financial wellness position of each employee, we feel that that will help them on the job.” ####  ##### The shift in focus to workers' current financial issues versus those of later years comes as employers and consultants realize millennials' sense of retirement can be very different than that of prior generations, Ms. Tredup said. ####  ##### An October study by personal finance firm NerdWallet Inc. pinpoints the retirement age of 2015 college graduates at 75 because of increasing student loan debt and rent. Today, the average retirement age is 62. ####  ##### For the baby boomers who are at or near retirement age, “we're finding that people aren't ready to retire, so they're staying on longer with their employer,” said Ted Goldman, managing director and U.S. retirement leader in the wealth practice at Buck Consultants at Xerox in Washington. ####  ##### That has come as many employers have replaced traditional pensions with defined contribution plans that put more responsibility on workers' shoulders. ####  ##### In those cases “the employer now has a workforce that's starting to bottle up opportunities for junior people,” Mr. Goldman said, and results “in higher health care costs because they have an older working population.” ####  ##### Buck Consultants has developed a tool that automatically enrolls workers in the company retirement plan at a contribution level based on factors such as the worker's age, salary and amount they have in their 401(k) account, Mr. Goldman said. ####  ##### “Doing that every year throughout your working lifetime, if you let it work, you will always be on a path toward a secure retirement,” he said. ####  ##### In addition to retirement, debt-saddled millennials are putting off other big purchases such as “buying a house (or) buying a car,” said Meghan Murphy, director of thought leadership at Fidelity Investments in Boston. ####  ##### So the investment firm advises workers to spend 50% of a paycheck on essential expenses, such as housing, food and health care, while saving 15% for retirement and 5% for an emergency fund. ####  ##### It's easier said than done, but millennials welcome help at work. According to an October study by Aon Hewitt, 46% of millennials said they want information on debt management from their employer. ####  ##### While millennials “know they should be saving” for the future, “what we often hear in conjunction with that, though, is the guilt of not being able to do it or not feeling like they're saving enough,” Ms. Murphy said. #### "
"Employers focus on health insurance plans providing better care and lower costs";"Benefits Management";"Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits";" ##### WASHINGTON — Employers and health insurers are pursuing fresh benefit plan designs and communication strategies aimed at reducing medical costs and improving overall health conditions among employees and their families. ####  ##### In 2016, Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp. plans to address the persistent issue of unnecessary and/or misinformed medical care and other types of systemic waste within its $1.25 billion health plan by implementing a “process-based plan design,” said Shawn Leavitt, Comcast's senior vice president of global benefits. ####  ##### “What we're saying is that it's our money, and we have a right and a responsibility to our employees to ensure that it's spent wisely,” Mr. Leavitt said earlier this month during a presentation at the 19th annual National Business Coalition on Health Conference in Washington. ####  ##### Consumerism by itself — at least as it is contemplated under many current high-deductible health plan designs — is unlikely to cut medical care costs or improve health outcomes, Mr. Leavitt said. Comcast is preparing a benefit plan design that couples value-based health care purchasing with independent third-party “personal shoppers” contracted to help employees and their families “receive the right care, in the right setting and at the right price from the right provider and at the right time,” he said ####  ##### “The concept is that rather than in-network or out-of-network, you're either in-process or out-of-process,” Mr. Leavitt said. “You're considered in-process if you're using the concierge services to make appointments for high-tech imaging, which ensures that you're being driven into high-quality, freestanding, lower-cost providers; or out-of-process if you're selecting it yourself and being reimbursed at a lower rate.” ####  ##### Mr. Leavitt said other examples of in-process utilization would likely include requests for additional medical opinions and cancer treatment plans that have been reviewed by top-rated specialist medical centers. ####  ##### “We're kind of giving up on the concept that narrowing the network is going to help, or that direct contracting is the big ticket. Potentially, it will involve reference pricing,” Mr. Leavitt said. “We can take one of these big, broad networks that everyone has and, through effective consumerism and the support and concierge services, we'll only use the parts of the network that actually work and are necessary.” ####  ##### Health insurers have also been investing time and resources to develop new programs and tools designed to improve the quality of both the medical care and health management communications employees and their families receive through their health benefit plans. ####  ##### Two years after rolling out its Member Centric Decision Management analytics and automated communications software platform in 2012, Chattanooga-based BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee Inc. estimates that the 36 clinical outreach campaigns it has launched using the platform have resulted in more than $1.5 million in averted medical costs by closing gaps in patient care and treatment regimens. ####  ##### The key to the platform's success is its capacity to work through a complex matrix of patients' previous claims, health risks, demographic and lifestyle information and communicate delivery preferences, said Lesia Stuart, director of predictive and accreditation analytics at BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, during a panel discussion at the NBCH conference. ####  ##### “When you marry all of those pieces of information together, you get a 360-degree view of the member,” Ms. Stuart said. ####  ##### Insurers also are developing programs that can help employers address their single biggest benefits communication challenge, according to survey data published earlier this month by the NBCH and San Francisco-based Benz Communications Inc.: driving higher levels of benefits engagement among employees and their families, particularly when it comes to health management and preventive care services. ####  ##### One such program is Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc.'s Habit Heroes, a multimedia collaboration between WellPoint, Marvel Worldwide Inc. and its parent company, The Walt Disney Co., designed to inspire healthier nutrition and exercise habits in children. ####  ##### “We worked with Disney and Marvel Comics to take a few basic psychological principals to develop within kids an internal sense of control over their behavior and choices,” said Davis Klaila, behavioral sciences director at WellPoint. ####  ##### The program, which consists of online and mobile-enabled videos, games and challenges, as well as a special edition comic book featuring popular Marvel characters, is free for all health insurance enrollees covered by WellPoint or one of its subsidiaries. ####  ##### “This is a primary intervention that can be done to help change behaviors, and it's something that every parent can do to help control health care costs,” Mr. Klaila said. #### "
"Employers moving post-65 retirees to private health insurance exchanges";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### A growing number of employers that offer health insurance to post-65 retirees are turning to private exchanges since the health care reform law took effect to provide coverage on an individual basis, often at a lower cost than their group plans could. ####  ##### The percentage of employers with 200 or more employees offering retiree health coverage had dropped to 28% in 2013 from 66% in 1988, according to the 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust survey of employer-sponsored health benefits. ####  ##### And while about 29% of employers that offer post-65 retiree health benefits are using private health exchanges, 27% of employers are considering doing so in the future and 44% are evaluating changes, according to a survey of 424 private and public plan sponsors representing 3.8 million retirees, benefit consultant Aon Hewitt said in a study released in February. ####  ##### Drivers of the movement that grew further as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were the 2013 elimination of the tax-favored status of the retiree drug subsidy and improvements to the Medicare Part D program that will eliminate the so-called “donut hole” by 2020, according to the Aon Hewitt survey. ####  ##### “In the post-ACA market, individual coverage has been more cost-effective for retirees, all while preserving retiree benefit value,” said John Grosso, Norwalk, Connecticut-based actuary and leader of Aon Hewitt's retiree health care task force. ####  ##### “Most employers that provide group health benefits to post-65 retirees are at the very least evaluating whether an exchange would work for them and their retirees,” said Eric Stanger, principal of health exchange solutions at Buck Consultants at Xerox in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. “We're not looking at first movers anymore. The level of activity we're seeing from employers has increased almost exponentially every year.” ####  ##### Moreover, by using exchanges, “it caps the costs for employers if they move to a defined contribution approach” to fund the benefits, and “it gives the retirees the ability to customize their benefits to what they really need,” said Barbara Gniewek, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. “It also eliminates the burden of administration.” ####  ##### Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. moved its 17,000 nonunion post-65 retirees and spouses to Aon Hewitt's private exchange in 2012. ####  ##### Now, the retirees, depending on where they reside, can have nearly three dozen plans from which to choose to find one that best fits their health care needs. Previously, UPS had a “one-size-fits-all” medical plan with a deductible and coinsurance, but paid a subsidy to post-65 retirees to purchase Part D coverage on the individual market, said B.J. Dorfman, Atlanta-based director of U.S. benefits. ####  ##### “We had a lot of feedback before from our retirees that there wasn't much value to our existing plan,” Ms. Dorfman said. “It was secondary to Medicare and didn't pay unless they hit a $1,000 out-of-pocket maximum. So from a design standpoint, the fact that they could pick their own plan and they had more choice — it was really appealing to them.” ####  ##### To fund its post-65 retiree health benefits, UPS in 2015 will put $2,157 per plan member into a health reimbursement arrangement, which the retirees use to purchase exchange coverage. If they purchase a less costly plan, they can use the funds in their HRA to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses. ####  ##### “It was a cost-neutral solution. We saw it as a way to provide better value for the same cost,” Ms. Dorfman said. ####  ##### While UPS' decision kept its costs the same, the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association halved its costs by moving 1,300 post-65 retirees in 2013 to Extend Health Inc., a private exchange Towers Watson & Co. purchased in 2012. ####  ##### “We were paying $5 million in 2012 for the group plan,” said Kathy Foster, assistant CEO for the Oakland, California-based association. “We also had some retirees call us and ask why they could get an individual plan through AARP that was basically the same plan but half the cost.” ####  ##### By switching to individual coverage via the exchange, the association's costs dropped to $2.5 million and kept coverage levels the same while giving retirees more choice. ####  ##### “Our retirees are enrolled in 214 different plans with 55 different carriers,” Ms. Foster said. ####  ##### One reason the cost is often less for individual post-65 retiree coverage purchased on an exchange is the risk is spread more than for a single-employer plan, experts say. ####  ##### “Your retiree group typically is getting smaller, older and sicker. The individual market has baby boomers retiring into it, most of whom don't have employer coverage. This is a better risk group because it's relatively healthy,” said John Barkett, director of health policy affairs at Towers Watson in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Still, the change can be confusing for retirees, who have little or no experience in shopping for health insurance, experts say. But most private health exchanges have customer service representatives to help post-65 retirees through the process. ####  ##### “Hand-holding, communications, customer service is critical to employers that send their retirees to the private exchanges,” said David Embry, president of Lockton Marketplace, a private exchange platform offered by Kansas City, Missouri-based insurance broker Lockton Cos. L.L.C. that is powered by SelectQuote Insurance Services. ####  ##### When the Alameda County retiree group evaluated exchange options prior to selecting Extend Health, “one of our main goals was to make sure retirees had a good level of customer service,” said Ms. Foster. “Prior to that, retirees would contact my staff regularly. They liked to call us and have us fix their problems. Since we didn't have control over the plans they would be enrolled in, we wanted to make sure that they had that same level of service.” ####  ##### In fact, even after contracting with an exchange, “we still do Medicare transition seminars and provide assistance to those who need it,” Ms. Foster said. #### "
"Health savings accounts have helped moderate costs over the past 10 years";"Benefits Management";"Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits";" ##### A decade ago, annual double-digit group health care plan cost increases were the norm. ####  ##### In 2003, for example, costs shot up 10%, the third consecutive year of double-digit cost increases, leading many employers and others to ask whether it was possible to control health care costs. ####  ##### A decade later, a very different health care plan cost story is playing out. In 2013, group health care plan costs nudged up just over 2%, the lowest increase since 1997, according to consulting firm Mercer L.L.C. ####  ##### And this year's cost increase was not a one-year fluke. In 2012, costs rose just 4.1%. ####  ##### While there is no one reason why health care plan cost increases have come down so dramatically, many experts say a key reason has been the large-scale employer adoption and employee enrollment in a health care plan design that didn't even exist a decade ago: high-deductible plans linked to health savings accounts. ####  ##### It was 10 years ago last week that President George W. Bush signed legislation authorizing HSA-linked plans, effective in 2004. ####  ##### From that beginning, HSAs have grown to be a major health care plan design. At the start of 2013, more than 15 million individuals were enrolled in HSA-linked plans, a 50% increase in just three years, while the overwhelming majority of employers now offer HSA-linked plans. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We wanted employees to better understand the cost of health care,” said Ray Allsup, senior director of global benefits at Lam Research Corp. in Fremont, Calif. ####  ##### At a dinner sponsored by the National Center for Policy Analysis and held in Washington in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the HSA authorization legislation, a key congressional backer of the legislation reflected on the impact of HSAs on consumer behavior and use of health care services. ####  ##### “It was about giving people incentives to be cost-conscious. It was incentivizing the consumer to be cost-conscious,” said former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who spoke at the dinner. ####  ##### The design of HSA-linked plans was radically different from that of mainstream plans, such as health maintenance organizations, and their low employee cost sharing requirements. ####  ##### In 2004 — the first year that employers could offer the arrangement — HSAs had to be linked to health insurance plans with a minimum deductible of $1,000 for single coverage and $2,000 for family coverage. Those minimum deductibles — which currently, due to an indexing feature in the law, are $1,250 for single coverage and $2,500 for family coverage — were many times higher than the $100 or $200 deductibles that were the norm a decade ago. ####  ##### But offsetting that much higher exposure to picking up a portion, or even all, of a medical or hospital bill was the HSA feature. Employers and employees could contribute on a tax-favored basis — currently as much as $3,250 for those with single coverage and $6,450 for family coverage — to the HSAs. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Under the law, employees can use HSA funds to pay for health care expenses that are not covered, such as those falling under a deductible. Unused funds can be rolled over year after year to pay for succeeding years' expenses and can also be used to pay for retiree health care expenses on a tax-free basis. ####  ##### Those high deductibles — coupled with the account feature — have made employees far better consumers of health care services, experts say. ####  ##### “When you have to use your own money, you start to understand health care costs and you become more prudent in spending on health care services,” said Joseph Jackson, CEO of HSA administrator WageWorks Inc. in San Mateo, Calif. ####  ##### One HSA executive, Gregg Larson, senior vice president and managing director of health care consumerism for Xerox Corp.'s HR solutions unit. in Minneapolis, cites his own experiences in how participating in an HSA-linked plan has made him a better consumer of health care services. ####  ##### After his son was injured in a sporting event and taken to an emergency room, the doctor suggested an MRI. Mr. Larson would have had to pay the roughly $1,500 cost of the MRI out of pocket. So he asked if an MRI were really necessary, and the doctor acknowledged that an X-ray would be appropriate. ####  ##### “It was an appropriate question from a consumer,” said Mr. Larson, noting that the exposure to big deductibles makes individuals, like himself, ask more questions as they search for lower-cost but appropriate care. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “Employees learn they can use fewer services and more cost-effective services. They learn they can go to an urgent care center rather than an emergency room,” said Michael Thompson, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### Asking questions in search of more cost-effective care has helped to make HSA-linked plans far less expensive than more traditional plan designs. ####  ##### For example, in 2013, HSA-linked plans cost an average of nearly $8,500 per employee, or about $1,700 less compared with traditional preferred provider organizations, according to a Mercer survey released last month. ####  ##### That cost difference is certain to trigger even greater employer adoption of HSA-linked plans in the years ahead, experts say. ####  ##### “You will see increased popularity in the next five to 10 years. We could get up to 50% enrollment,” said Todd Berkley, president of HSA Consulting Services L.L.C. in Minnetonka, Minn. ####  ##### Currently, according to Mercer, about 18% of employees are enrolled in HSA-linked plans, or plans linked to health reimbursement arrangements, which are somewhat similar to HSAs. ####  ##### “We have only seen the tip of the iceberg,” Mr. Thompson added. #### "
"JPMorgan wins dismissal of Madoff conspiracy suit";"Risk Management";"";" ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—A federal appeals court threw out a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase & Co. of violating U.S. racketeering law by conspiring with Bernard Madoff to further his Ponzi scheme. ####  ##### Thursday's decision in a case brought by a Florida partnership that invested with Mr. Madoff came less than two weeks after the trustee seeking money for Madoff victims separately filed an amended $19.9 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan, accusing it of enabling Mr. Madoff's fraud and ignoring red flags. ####  ##### The trustee, Irving Picard, is trying to use the same racketeering law to recover as much as $58.8 billion from dozens of European defendants in his largest Madoff lawsuit. ####  ##### In Thursday's decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected an allegation by MLSMK Investment Co. that JPMorgan violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by conspiring with Mr. Madoff to ""fleece"" customers, and failing to freeze his accounts. ####  ##### MLSMK, based in Palm Beach, Fla., said it lost its $12.8 million investment with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities L.L.C. when Mr. Madoff was arrested on Dec. 11, 2008. It sought to hold JPMorgan liable for conspiracy under RICO, which allows treble damages, by aiding and abetting Mr. Madoff's fraud. ####  ##### But Judge Robert Sack, writing for a three-judge panel, said a federal ban on civil RICO claims based on securities fraud also covers aiding and abetting claims. ####  ##### ""As the plaintiff concedes,"" he wrote, ""the purpose of the bar was to prevent litigants from using artful pleading to bootstrap securities fraud cases into RICO cases, with their threat of treble damages."" ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones had dismissed MLSMK's RICO claim on different grounds. The 2nd Circuit had on June 6 also upheld her dismissal of four New York state law claims. ####  ##### Appeal possible ####  ##### ""The circuit essentially said aiders and abetters of securities fraud have a free pass, because plaintiffs cannot sue them for securities fraud or RICO,"" Howard Kleinhendler, a partner at Wachtel & Masyr L.L.P. representing MLSMK, said in an interview. ""I don't think that's a correct result, or what Congress intended."" ####  ##### He said his client may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### Patricia Hynes, a partner at Allen & Overy representing JPMorgan, called the decision ""a very important ruling."" ####  ##### She said it resolved a split of opinion among judges in the 2nd Circuit, and makes clear that plaintiffs cannot do an ""end run"" around laws barring RICO claims based on securities fraud by presenting their claims differently. ####  ##### Mr. Picard filed his $58.8 billion lawsuit against dozens of defendants including Austria's Bank Medici A.G., its founder, Sonja Kohn, and Italy's UniCredit S.p.A.

"UBS sued over $900M Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac loss";"Risk Management";"Risk Management";" ##### NEW YORK (Reuters)—UBS A.G. was sued by the conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which accused the Swiss bank of misleading the housing agencies into buying risky mortgage debt, resulting in more than $900 million of losses. ####  ##### The lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency is the latest effort by Washington to prop up the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), whose September 2008 federal seizure has so far cost taxpayers more than $135 billion. ####  ##### UBS spokesman Peter McKillop had no immediate comment. ####  ##### Other banks including Bank of America Corp. and its Countrywide unit have faced lawsuits by investors who claim to have lost money in mortgage-backed debt. ####  ##### According to the FHFA complaint filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lost more than 20% of their more than $4.5 billion investment in residential mortgage-backed securities sold by UBS in 16 securitizations between September 2005 and August 2007. ####  ##### The complaint said UBS hid or misstated the quality of the underlying loans and underwriting, and the ability of borrowers to make payments. ####  ##### Many of the loans were issued by lenders that later failed or went bankrupt, including American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., IndyMac Bancorp Inc. and New Century Financial Corp. ####  ##### According to the complaint, a review of 966 randomly chosen loans from two ""triple-A"" rated securitizations in 2006 and 2007 found that 78% were not underwritten properly. ####  ##### By May 2011, the complaint said, these securitizations were rated ""CCC"" by Standard & Poor's Corp. and ""Ca"" by Moody's Investors Service Inc., among the lowest junk grades. ####  ##### ""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not know of the untruths and omissions,"" the complaint said. ""If the GSEs would have known of those untruths and omissions, they would not have purchased the GSE certificates."" ####  ##### The lawsuit seeks to recoup Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's losses and undo the purchases, among other remedies. ####  ##### Republican lawmakers in Washington have been trying to reduce taxpayer support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and attract more private capital to the $10.6 trillion residential mortgage market. The Treasury Department pledged in December 2009 to provide unlimited aid to the GSEs through 2012. ####  ##### The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency vs. UBS Americas Inc. et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-05201. #### "
"ING sells LatAm ops to Colombia's GrupoSura";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Retirement Benefits, Latin America, Netherlands, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### AMSTERDAM and BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuters)—Dutch Bancassurer ING Groep N.V. said Monday it would sell most of its Latin American operations to Colombia's GrupoSura for €2.6 billion ($3.73 billion) in the largest-ever acquisition abroad by a Colombian company. ####  ##### The sale of the Latin American insurance and investment management business by ING would pave the way for the sale of its U.S., European and Asian operations, which are worth about €18 billion to €19 billion ($25.84 billion to $27.28 billion). ####  ##### Reuters exclusively reported in March that ING had started the sale of its Latin American arm. ING had agreed to split its bank and insurance operations in return for approval for €10 billion ($14.36 billion) of state aid in 2008 and has said it plans to repay the Dutch state in full by May. ####  ##### ""We continue to prepare our remaining insurance and investment management businesses for our base case of two IPOs—one for the U.S. businesses and one for the European and Asian businesses—so that we will be ready to proceed when markets are favorable,"" ING CEO Jan Hommen said. ####  ##### Some analysts say ING might fetch a higher price for its insurance assets through trade sales rather than initial public offerings. ####  ##### ""ING could also decide to sell other insurance and investment management operations, in particular those in Asia, to a rival instead of listing them,"" said Theodoor Gilissen analyst Tom Muller. ""We know several parties want to expand in Asia."" ####  ##### Mr. Muller praised the GrupoSura deal. ""This is a great deal (for ING), particularly the price,"" he said. ""They're making quite a book profit on it."" ####  ##### Financing the ING purchase ####  ##### The sale announced Monday involves ING's insurance, pension, savings and investment management operations in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Peru for €2.6 billion in cash. GrupoSura would also take on €65 million ($93.3 million) of debt. ####  ##### That excludes ING's 36% stake in Brazil's Sul America S.A., which would be divested separately. ####  ##### GrupoSura, or Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana, is a financial holding firm listed on the Colombian stock exchange and has investments in Colombia's biggest insurer and bank. ####  ##### The ING deal would be the largest acquisition abroad by a Colombian company. It would amount to more than half of total investment abroad by Colombian companies in 2010. #### "
"Berkshire smells a bargain with $3.2B bid for Transatlantic: Analysts ";"Risk Management";"P/C Insurers, Berkshire Hathaway, Bermuda, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### NEW YORK—Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s entry into the takeover battle for Transatlantic Holdings Inc. signals that reinsurance industry insiders think the New York-based reinsurer is a bargain, according to analysts. ####  ##### Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire's main reinsurance unit, National Indemnity Co., offered to buy Transatlantic for about $3.2 billion, Transatlantic said on Sunday. ####  ##### The offer comes after two rival reinsurers, Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings A.G. and Validus Holdings Ltd., made separate offers for Transatlantic, which is the former reinsurance affiliate of American International Group Inc. ####  ##### Zug, Switzerland-based Allied World's all-stock merger agreement with Transatlantic was valued at $3.2 billion when it was announced in June, and Bermuda-based Validus' cash-and-stock offer was valued at about $3.5 billion when it was made in July.  Both offers declined in value, however, after equity markets swooned in recent weeks. Validus' offer is now valued at $44.575 per share, and Allied World's is valued at $43.58 per share. ####  ##### Berkshire said in an Aug. 5 letter to Transatlantic's president and CEO Robert Orlich that its offer is subject to a formal response no later than the close of business on Monday. ####  ##### Transatlantic said in a statement Sunday that its board “will carefully consider and evaluate the proposal from National Indemnity and will inform Transatlantic stockholders of the board's position.” It advised stockholders to await its recommendation. A company spokesman did not return phone calls. ####  ##### Berkshire offered $52 a share “under customary terms for a stock purchase agreement of a publicly traded company to be agreed (but not subject to any due diligence review or financing condition of any nature),” the letter said. ####  ##### In contrast, Allied World's offer was worth around $44.47 a share in intraday trading on Monday, while Validus' was around $45.88 a share. ####  ##### “Evidently Berkshire sees this as an attractive price for a well established reinsurer,” said Bruce Ballentine, an analyst in New York at Moody's Investor Services. “The pattern of Berkshire is to buy assets that seem undervalued.” ####  ##### If Transatlantic accepts the offer, Berkshire would get the company at 78% of book value, taking into account the $115 million break-up fee that Transatlantic agreed to pay Allied World in such an event. ####  ##### “It's amazing that they're comfortable doing this without due diligence, but I think at 78% of book value they have a good margin of safety,” said Paul Howard, director of research at Solstice Investment Research L.L.C. in Glastonbury, Conn. ####  ##### Berkshire's offer “validates Validus' theory that the commercial reinsurance space is likely to turn around for the positive sometime next year,” said Michael G. Paisan, a New York-based analyst for financial services firm Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Inc., which makes a market in the securities of Validus. ####  ##### Validus and Allied World fired back at Berkshire. ####  ##### Validus said in a statement Sunday that while its offer declined from $55.95 per share as of July 12, it still provides Transatlantic stockholders the opportunity to participate in the combined company's potential to improve its value in the future. ####  ##### Allied World had offered to give Transatlantic shareholders a 58% stake in the combined entity, while Validus had offered 48% ownership, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### “While the National Indemnity offer acknowledges the value of the Transatlantic franchise, it fails to provide Transatlantic stockholders with any participation in the upside of the combined company,” said Validus chairman and CEO Ed Noonan in the statement. ####  ##### Allied World's president and CEO Scott Carmilani said his offer allows shareholders to participate in the combined company's upside potential. “In contrast, National Indemnity's proposal is, at best, opportunistic and seeks to acquire Transatlantic for cash at a significant discount to book value, leaving Transatlantic shareholders no upside potential,” he said in a statement Sunday. ####  ##### Berkshire declined to comment. ####  ##### It's not the first time that Berkshire has joined into a bidding war involving Validus. After Validus made an unsolicited bid for IPC Holdings Ltd. in 2009,  Berkshire reportedly made an all-cash offer for the Bermudian property catastrophe reinsurer. But Validus ended up completing the deal in July 2009 for $1.65 billion cash and stock. #### "
"Bermuda approaches Solvency II equivalency";"Risk Management";"European Union, P/C Insurers, Regulation, Bermuda";" ##### HAMILTON, Bermuda—The Bermuda Monetary Authority said it is “pleased” that the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority’s preliminary assessment of Bermuda’s regulatory framework in relation to Solvency II indicated that the island’s regulatory system for commercial insurers generally meets the criteria for Solvency II equivalence. ####  ##### Bermuda is among the first wave of non-European Union countries, along with Japan and Switzerland, being considered for third-country equivalence status, meaning its regulations have been accepted as being equivalent to the upcoming Solvency II risk-based capital regulatory system being drafted in Europe. ####  ##### In a statement issued Wednesday, the BMA said, “In particular, we note the alignment of our regime with Solvency II principles in key areas such as the scope of group supervision and the solvency regime for groups.” ####  ##### Not completely compliant ####  ##### But the EIOPA’s draft report, which also was issued Wednesday, said Bermuda was not completely in compliance in several areas, including governance and public disclosure. ####  ##### The BMA said in its statement that it “expected, and have under active consideration, EIOPA’s suggestions or caveats on areas for additional regime enhancements. Since this assessment is the first phase of a process that will conclude in 2012 with the E.U. ####  ##### Commission’s final decision on equivalence, in the interim period we can conclude work on these areas and the various work streams already in progress.” ####  ##### EIOPA draft reports issued Wednesday also found that neither Japan nor Switzerland had achieved complete equivalence status. ####  ##### For in-depth coverage of this topic and related issues, visit our Solution Arc on Solvency II Compliance and Business Challenges for Insurers. #### "
"Appellate court reinstates case involving black New Haven, Conn., firefighter";"Risk Management";"Employment Practices";" ##### NEW YORK—A federal appellate court reinstated a lawsuit brought by a black New Haven, Conn., firefighter over the same 2003 exam that was the focus of a U.S. Supreme Court case. ####  ##### In June 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court in Frank Ricci et al. vs. John DeStefano et al. ruled in favor of 17 firefighters—16 white and one Hispanic—who sued New Haven because the city rejected the 2003 captain and lieutenant's promotion exams out of fear it would be sued for discrimination by minority candidates. The majority held that Title VII prohibits intentional discrimination, or disparate treatment, as well as disparate impact, which are practices that are “facially neutral” but discriminatory in operation. ####  ##### Last month, those Connecticut firefighters accepted settlement offers from the city totaling about $2 million to end their case. ####  ##### New case can move forward ####  ##### In his 2009 suit, Michael Briscoe vs. City of New Haven, Mr. Briscoe argued he failed to win a promotion after the 2003 lieutenant exam because the test was weighted 60% for its written portion and 40% for its oral portion. The suit said the oral exam was a “better way to assess candidates' skills and abilities than the written test and had less disparate impact on African-Americans.” ####  ##### In its decision Monday, a panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Mr. Briscoe still could pursue his case despite the Ricci decision. The opinion stated that after careful review of that decision “and relevant nonparty preclusion and Title VII case law, we conclude that Briscoe's claim is neither precluded nor properly dismissed.” ####  ##### The Briscoe decision, however, which overturned a lower court ruling, added that while it was remanding the case for further proceedings, it expresses no view as to whether other issues, including relevant statutes of limitations, “may warrant dismissal of the action.” #### "
"Worker for subsidiary not employed by parent company: Appeals court ";"Risk Management";"Coverage Disputes";" ##### BOSTON—A worker for a subsidiary is not the parent company’s employee, despite an employee’s belief to the contrary, a federal appeals court ruled in dismissing the parent as a defendant in an employment discrimination case. ####  ##### According to Wednesday’s ruling in Caroline DeLia vs. Verizon Communications Inc. et al. by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the worker sued New York-based Verizon Communications Inc. and some of its subsidiaries, alleging she was sexually harassed by a co-worker and that her employer responded inadequately. ####  ##### Ms. DeLia worked as an artist for Idearc Media Corp., which was known for almost all of her 16-year employment as Verizon Directories Service-East Inc. Idearc was a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Directories Corp., which was a subsidiary of GTE Corp. and ultimately the parent company. ####  ##### Supervisor fired ####  ##### Ms. Delia, who alleged she was harassed for several months in 2005 by a supervisor, reported his behavior to Verizon’s equal employment opportunity personnel, who conducted interviews and made recommendations for corrective action. The supervisor eventually was fired after an incident involving a male employee. ####  ##### Ms. DeLia filed suit alleging a hostile work environment, sexual harassment and retaliation under state and federal employment laws. ####  ##### She provided evidence to support her contention that she was a Verizon employee, including stating she worked in Verizon’s Middleton, Mass., office and that her office key card bore Verizon’s logo. ####  ##### ‘Subjective belief’ ####  ##### However, Ms. “DeLia does not dispute that it was Idearc’s office, her own subjective belief notwithstanding,” a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled unanimously “Nor is the logo on the key card—indicating that the card itself is property of Verizon—probative of an employment relationship with Verizon.” ####  ##### The court also said that although it is undisputed that Verizon administered her benefits, “she was paid by Idearc, which maintained its own accounts, records and payroll, and which issued DeLia an annual W-2 form,” the court ruled. ####  ##### “We do not doubt that DeLia may have thought Verizon was her employer, but her subjective belief alone is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact,” the panel ruled in upholding a lower court’s ruling dismissing Verizon as a defendant in the case. #### "
"Catastrophe claim surge sends Amlin to first-half loss";"Risk Management";"Catastrophes, P/C Insurers";" ##### LONDON (Reuters)—Lloyd's of London insurer Amlin P.L.C. posted a £192.3 million ($316.7 million) pretax loss in the first half of 2011 as a result of a surge in claims from this year's Japanese earthquake and other natural disasters. ####  ##### However, Amlin said it hoped to recover from those losses and make a profit in the second half of the year, barring new major catastrophes or disasters, since it should benefit from rising reinsurance prices. ####  ##### “We do expect to make a second-half profit,” Chief Executive Charles Philipps said during a conference call. He declined to give any more specific second-half profit guidance. ####  ##### Amlin earlier this month already had warned of a loss of about £180 million, ($296.4 million) some 65 million ($107 million) more than analysts were expecting, because of a bigger-than-expected hit from the earthquake and a surprise jump in claims at Amlin Corporate Insurance, its European commercial insurance unit. ####  ##### Analysts have said the Aug. 2 profit warning dented Amlin's reputation for carefully controlling its exposure to major catastrophes. ####  ##### Its stock price has fallen about 20% over the past month. ####  ##### “We remain cautious on the stock, with an ‘underweight' recommendation,” JP Morgan Chase & Co. said in a research note. ####  ##### This year has already displaced 2005 as the costliest on record for natural disasters, with economic losses from catastrophes in the first six months alone totaling $265 billion, according to Munich Reinsurance Co. ####  ##### Amlin joined peers including Hiscox Ltd., Beazley P.L.C. and Catlin Group Ltd. in reporting steep first-half losses, weighed down by an unprecedented run of catastrophes including floods in Australia, earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, and tornadoes in the United States. ####  ##### Amlin said it was on track with its plans to improve the performance of the ACI division, formerly Fortis Corporate Insurance N.V., which it acquired in 2009. ####  ##### Amlin maintained its interim dividend at 7.2 pence (11.9 cents) per share. It said it remained confident on its long-term prospects and hoped to maintain its full-year dividend payout. ####  ##### “While our results are disappointing, the core underwriting businesses in London and Bermuda are well-placed to take advantage of an improving rating environment, particularly in catastrophe lines,” Mr. Philipps said. #### "

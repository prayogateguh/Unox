"FTC loses bid to block Advocate, NorthShore merger";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### A federal judge on Tuesday handed another loss to the Federal Trade Commission, denying its request to temporarily halt a merger between Chicago-area hospital systems Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University HealthSystem. ####  ##### The proposed merger is one of the largest healthcare deals to be challenged by the FTC in years. The decision is the second loss in a row for the FTC, after years of scoring victories in such cases. ####  ##### Advocate CEO Jim Skogsbergh praised the decision in a statement. ####  ##### Judge Alonso's decision reaffirmed what we have wholeheartedly believed since day one—this merger is a big win for consumers and for healthcare in our country as the shift to value takes hold,”Skogsbergh said. ####  ##### Debbie Feinstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, in a statement Tuesday called the ruling ""disappointing"" and said the FTC will consider its options. ####  ##### The FTC alleged that a combined NorthShore and Advocate would have enough bargaining leverage with insurers to increase prices because insurers would be hard-pressed to build marketable networks without Advocate and NorthShore hospitals. The FTC said a merger would lead to an 8%, or $45 million, price increase and the systems would control 60% of general-acute inpatient hospital services in Chicago's north suburbs if they combined. ####  ##### The systems, however, said that if their market were properly defined that figure would be closer to 28%. Advocate has 12 hospitals and NorthShore has four. The systems also promised, that if allowed to unite, they'd offer a new insurance product that would cost 10% less than the lowest-priced comparable product available, saving consumers $210 million to $1.1 billion a year. ####  ##### Many have been watching the case closely as healthcare systems across the country continue to merge in what they say is an effort to improve quality and lower costs but others claim is an attempt to increase their negotiating power with insurers. ####  ##### The decision Tuesday follows another recent, relatively rare loss for the FTC. In May, a federal judge in Pennsylvania refused to grant the FTC a preliminary injunction to stop a merger between Penn State Hershey (Pa.) Medical Center and PinnacleHealth System in Harrisburg. The FTC is appealing the decision. ####  ##### In the Advocate/NorthShore case, the FTC may now appeal the matter to a higher court or continue its own administrative proceedings against the merger, though it doesn't typically continue those proceedings on its own without first getting an injunction. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Big players dropping HSA business despite growth potential";"Benefits Management";"Consumer-driven Health Plans, Health Care Benefits, Wells Fargo Insurance Services";" ##### Some big-name financial institutions recently exited the health savings account business despite the market's steady growth. A main reason: The prospects and potential profits aren't big enough compared with their other businesses. ####  ##### The latest to leave is Wells Fargo & Co., which confirmed in late May it is selling its HSA business. ####  ##### U.S. Bancorp, Huntington Bancshares Inc., M&T Bank Corp. and The Bancorp Inc., as well as insurer Assurant Inc., all sold their HSA management businesses and/or their HSA accounts within the past 12 months. JPMorgan Chase & Co. sold its HSA business in early 2015. ####  ##### As Pensions & Investments reported May 16, HSA deposit assets and the investment assets within HSAs have grown consistently — although their sizes are small compared with retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. ####  ##### Large financial institutions with many lines of business are getting out of HSAs to concentrate on bigger and more profitable businesses, said Roy Ramthun, president of HSA Consulting Services, Silver Spring, Maryland. ####  ##### “They have other priorities, and this (HSA management) is too small a piece,” Mr. Ramthun said. HSA management requires investments in technology that executives at large institutions might decide are not worth the effort given their expected return on investment. ####  ##### “The more the HSA market matures, the more consolidation you will see,” said Eric Remjeske, president of Devenir Group L.L.C., a Minneapolis-based investment adviser and consultant in the HSA business. ####  ##### Total HSA assets reached $30.2 billion in 2015, about triple the amount in 2009, said the latest annual survey by Devenir. Investments accounted for $4.2 billion, or 14% of last year's total, according to the survey based on the 100 largest HSA managers. ####  ##### Pursued by giants ####  ##### The potential for growth in HSA assets has prompted giants such as Fidelity Investments, Boston, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, New York, to continue pursuing their HSA management strategies. ####  ##### However, for the dropouts — at least those willing to comment — HSAs no longer fit their long-term strategies. ####  ##### “Wells Fargo periodically reviews its businesses and determined that the sale of (our) Health Benefit Services to an industry leader would provide our customers with a better platform for the future,” the company said in a statement. ####  ##### “Health Benefit Services has been a well-managed business for our company,” the Wells Fargo statement continued. “This decision was not an easy one to make. However, we believe that it allows us to focus on businesses that are more core to Wells Fargo's future.” ####  ##### Wells Fargo is selling its HSA business to Optum Bank Inc., part of United Health Group Inc., Minnetonka, Minnesota. A May 31 notice on the Optum website welcomed Wells Fargo HSA account holders, noting the transaction is awaiting regulatory approval. ####  ##### Representatives of Optum and Wells Fargo didn't provide transaction details, the number of HSA participants or the HSA assets that Optum was acquiring. Sources estimated Wells Fargo's HSA business covers 650,000 participants and $1.9 billion in assets. ####  ##### “By and large, the acquirers' (investment) offerings tend to be broader than those of the sellers,” said Devenir's Mr. Remjeske, referring to the recent HSA deals. ####  ##### Each of the buyers has an array of open architecture mutual fund choices for their HSA account holders. Some also offer self-directed brokerage accounts. ####  ##### According to Optum's website, HSA participants can choose among 26 mutual funds. The mutual funds are offered through Devenir. ####  ##### Optum has been an active buyer. In December 2015, it bought the HSA deposits of U.S. Bancorp, Minneapolis. Optum spokeswoman Lauren Mihajlov declined to provide any information. ####  ##### Not wanted ####  ##### Richard Davis, chairman, CEO and president of U.S. Bancorp, told securities analysts Jan. 15 that HSA management wasn't part of his long-term strategy. “We are in every business line that we're in that we want,” according to a transcript of the company's quarterly earnings call. ####  ##### “We're not in anything we don't want to be in,” Mr. Davis said. “We don't covet anything we don't have. We just want to be better at what we're doing and do it better, deeper, wherever we are.” ####  ##### Dana Ripley, a U.S. Bancorp spokesman, declined to offer additional comment. ####  ##### In June 2015, Optum acquired the HSA deposits of Huntington Bancshares. Optum's Ms. Mihajlov didn't provide any information. William Eiler, a spokesman for Huntington, declined to discuss the HSA business or the reason for selling it. ####  ##### JPMorgan sold its HSA business in January 2015 to Webster Financial Corp., Waterbury, Connecticut, whose HSA Bank unit, based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, administers the accounts. The transfer of all accounts was completed March 1, 2016, said Bob Guenther, a Webster Financial spokesman. ####  ##### Mr. Guenther said HSA Bank administers 2 million HSA accounts, with $4.08 billion in deposit assets and $728 million in investments. The JPMorgan business contributed about 700,000 accounts, $1.3 billion in deposits and $175 million in investments, he said. Kristen Chambers, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. ####  ##### The HSA Bank website said participants can choose from 19 mutual funds, offered through Devenir, and a self-directed brokerage account from TD Ameritrade. ####  ##### Another recent buyer of HSA accounts from banks is HealthEquity Inc., Draper, Utah. HealthEquity is an HSA custodian firm with 2.2 million members as of April 30, up 51% from 12 months earlier. ####  ##### The company's HSA assets under management rose to $4.1 billion by April 30, an increase of 61% from a year earlier. The AUM includes $488 million in investments, up 41%. ####  ##### HealthEquity offers 41 mutual funds, which are selected by HealthEquity Advisors L.L.C., its investment subsidiary, the company website said. ####  ##### HealthEquity also offers a group of 26 “optional choice” mutual funds for additional fees. ####  ##### “You need specialized capabilities in function and distribution” to manage HSA accounts profitably and effectively, said Jon Kessler, president and CEO of HealthEquity. Without a willingness to invest in technology and distribution, an HSA account manager might choose to exit the business, he added. ####  ##### HealthEquity bought about 35,000 HSA accounts with $63 million in assets from M&T Bank Inc., Buffalo. The deal was announced in January and closed in March, Mr. Kessler said. ####  ##### Chet Bridger, an M&T spokesman, declined to comment. ####  ##### Closed its purchase ####  ##### HealthEquity in December 2015 closed its purchase of about 160,000 HSA accounts representing about $390 million in deposits from The Bancorp Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, Mr. Kessler said. ####  ##### John Chrystal said the HSA sale “was a strategic decision that was accretive to our earnings and capital,” according to a transcript of a Feb. 1 earnings conference call with analysts. At the time of the conference call, Mr. Chrystal was interim CEO of The Bancorp; he remains a director. ####  ##### In another recent HSA deal, SelectAccount, St. Paul, Minnesota, acquired HSA assets and other medical-account assets from Assurant Inc., a New York-based insurance company. SelectAccount administers HSAs and other medical spending accounts. ####  ##### Assurant wanted “to sharpen our focus on the housing and lifestyle markets,” and the HSA deal was part of its effort to “wind down our health insurance business,' said Alan Colberg, the company's CEO and president, in a March 15 news release. ####  ##### In an interview, David Cantu, chief marketing officer of SelectAccount, said the deal closed April 1, enabling his company to acquire 10,000 HSA accounts with $59.8 million in assets. ####  ##### SelectAccount now has more than 250,000 HSA accounts with $700 million in deposit assets and $105 million in investment assets. Its HSA program offers 26 mutual funds; Devenir is the investment adviser. Participants can invest in a self-directed brokerage account through Charles Schwab & Co. ####  ##### SelectAccount is the name used by MII Life Inc., which is owned by the privately held Aware Integrated Inc., St. Paul, a diversified health services company. ####  ##### Robert Steyer writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Retirees sue Weyerhaeuser over terminated health benefits ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Regulation, General liability";" ##### Forest-products manufacturer Weyerhaeuser Co. violated earlier promises to its retired employees by first cutting and then terminating health benefits for several thousand retirees, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. ####  ##### Four retired Weyerhaeuser employees charged in the suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon, that Weyerhaeuser's action in 2011 to replace its retiree medical plan with a health reimbursement arrangement in which the company contributed just over $1,300 a year to retirees' HRAs, followed by its decision in 2015 to eliminate the HRAs, clashed with earlier commitments to provide coverage. ####  ##### In 2009, for example, according to the suit, the company's top executive, wrote in correspondence outlining a new health care plan, that the company remained “committed to offering medical benefits to retirees.” ####  ##### The suit, filed by the law firm Haglund Kelley L.L.P. in Portland, seeks reinstatement of the benefits consistent with those promised in a 1979 summary plan description document. ####  ##### A spokeswoman for Federal Way, Washington-based Weyerhaeuser said the company does not comment on pending litigation. #### "

"Health insurer joins stampede to narrow networks";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is cutting back its participation in the state's Affordable Care Act insurance exchange next year after losing nearly $300 million in the individual market in 2015. ####  ##### However, the large Blues insurer is not completely exiting the state-based marketplace. Fully withdrawing has its consequences: Federal law bars insurers from re-entering the marketplaces for five years, assuming they discontinue all types of individual policies. ####  ##### Instead, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is dropping health plans with the broadest networks sold on and off the exchange and will push people toward its narrower HMO option called Blue Plus, according to the Star Tribune. ####  ##### Plans with more limited networks of doctors and hospitals usually offer cheaper monthly premiums, which has been appealing to the price-sensitive exchange crowd, but they have also created some confusion for members unfamiliar with the products. ####  ##### “The premiums will be lower, but (consumers) may not get the same choice of doctors and hospitals that they had before,” said Roger Feldman, a health economist at the University of Minnesota. “It's one of the hard choices that's being increasingly faced in health insurance more generally.” ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota's decision is not unprecedented and has been embraced by other insurers around the country. The Blues plans in Illinois, New Mexico and Texas — all of which are owned by Health Care Service Corp., a giant Chicago-based company that has lost billions of dollars on ACA plans — abandoned their broad-network exchange plans in favor of the narrow-network HMOs. ####  ##### “Some of these Blue plans are not able to tolerate these significant losses,” said Cynthia Cox, an associate director and health insurance researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ####  ##### Ms. Cox also said Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota's emphasis on its HMO subsidiary is similar to what UnitedHealth Group Inc. has done in some exchange states. Although UnitedHealthcare Inc. is only staying in a handful of ACA marketplaces, its Harken Health subsidiary is ramping up in Florida, Georgia and Illinois. Harken is a clinic-based health plan built on the premise of providing primary care at no charge. ####  ##### Dropping broad-network plans can also be seen as a controversial risk dump for insurers. The sickest people who cost the most to insure often chose plans with higher monthly premiums to gain access to broader provider networks and fewer out-of-pocket costs. In Minnesota next year, those people may opt to buy those plans with other carriers, immediately benefiting the Blues' bottom line while redirecting the insurance risk elsewhere. ####  ##### Mr. Feldman said what Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and other insurers are doing reminds him of when HMOs became the default health policy a couple decades ago, and when individuals and employees revolted at the restricted choice of providers. ####  ##### “Almost everything has been tried at least once,” Mr. Feldman said. “This does represent a return to the model we had in the 1990s, and we went away from it because people were not willing to make the trade-off at that point.” He sees the employer market eventually making its way down this path as well, considering the ACA's “Cadillac” tax on high-cost health plans goes into effect in 2020. ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota ended 2015 with a $178 million net loss on $3.76 billion of revenue from its fully insured lines of business, according to financial documents. Those totals don't include business from self-insured employers. The company's underwriting losses just on individual-market plans — which don't include administrative expenses or taxes — totaled $280 million. ####  ##### However, its Blue Choice subsidiary posted a $52 million net surplus on $895 million of revenue in 2015, according to separate financial filings. ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota did not respond to interview requests. ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Will Trump embrace controversial House GOP health proposals?";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### After promising for six years to offer a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, House Republican leaders last week presented a white paper that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called “a real plan, in black and white” to “make health care actually affordable.” ####  ##### But several health policy experts questioned that description, given that the 35-page document contains few details and no numbers describing how much the proposal would cost, how it would be financed or how many Americans would gain or lose health insurance. ####  ##### Past presidential candidates including President Barack Obama have laid out similarly vague campaign blueprints. Now, however, Rep. Ryan and his colleagues want to replace a law that has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans and helped slow spending growth. ####  ##### “The difference between putting down principles and writing legislation is that when you write legislation, you have to commit to numbers and details,” said John Goodman, a veteran GOP health policy adviser who helped draft a recent ACA replacement bill sponsored by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. He nevertheless praised parts of the House GOP package. ####  ##### Several experts called the House GOP manifesto a rehash of old conservative ideas that Republicans have never seriously tried to implement. “It's no more a plan than saying, 'I'm going to build a house. Here's a stick-figure picture of it, and I can get it for you for next to nothing,'” said Norm Ornstein, a veteran political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. ####  ##### There was skepticism about whether presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would embrace it, particularly its politically volatile calls to cap Medicaid spending and turn Medicare into a defined-contribution program, exposing future retirees to higher out-of-pocket costs. During the primaries, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Rep. Ryan's past efforts to restructure and cut those programs, and blamed his proposals for Mitt Romney's loss in the 2012 presidential election. Some think Mr. Trump is likely to repudiate the Medicare part of the GOP plan, though other parts overlap with his own brief seven-point proposal. ####  ##### “Ryan's Medicare voucher plan has been shown to be extremely unpopular in polls among people age 50 and older,” said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. ####  ##### The plan, which lacks details and numbers, would make big changes in Medicare and Medicaid. ####  ##### After repealing the ACA and its coverage mandates, the House GOP plan would offer people who lack public or employer coverage a refundable tax credit in an unspecified amount — adjusted by age, not income — to help them buy insurance. It would limit the tax exclusion for employer health plans; convert Medicaid into a program of capped federal contributions to the states, rolling back the coverage expansion to low-income, able-bodied adults; change Medicare into a “premium support” model while gradually raising the eligibility age to 67; and implement a wide array of standard conservative proposals, such as interstate sales of health plans, expansion of health savings accounts and limits on medical malpractice suits. ####  ##### It seeks to make the individual market more financially viable for insurers by allowing them to charge older and sicker customers at least five times more than younger and healthier members, rather than the ACA's maximum of three times more. ####  ##### Mr. Goodman said Rep. Ryan's group dodged the tough trade-offs. By repealing the ACA's hundreds of billions in taxes, GOP lawmakers would be left with little revenue for funding adequate tax credits to make coverage affordable to those without employer-based plans. “The brutal reality that Republicans have been reluctant to discuss is if you repeal all of Obamacare, there is no money to insure all of the uninsured,” he said. ####  ##### That may be all right with Rep. Ryan, because universal health care is not necessarily his goal. “Obamacare is all about quantity, with the goal to get as many people insured as possible,” he said at the plan's rollout Wednesday. “Our plan is about quality. We'll give (consumers) the tools to get the best care possible. We give you a choice and put you in charge, not the bureaucracy.” ####  ##### But repealing the ACA taxes would force Republicans to rely on imposing a tax on employer health plans that's more onerous than the ACA's so-called Cadillac plan tax, which Congress postponed with bipartisan support in December. ####  ##### While the GOP white paper says that “most Americans' plans would not be affected,” Mr. Goodman thinks otherwise. “If that tax isn't big, they won't have the money to have a reasonable tax credit,” he said. “And if it's big, it will hit the average worker.” ####  ##### That could cause political headaches for Republicans in the November elections, and afterward, if they win and try to cap the tax exclusion for employer health plans. Business groups including the National Business Group on Health have already come out against the GOP plan to tax employer health plans. ####  ##### Another potential political problem for Republicans is their plan would roll back the ACA's popular guarantee that consumers can obtain insurance during an annual open enrollment despite pre-existing medical conditions. ####  ##### Under the GOP plan, individuals would have a one-time opportunity to enroll without regard to pre-existing conditions, and would be able to keep that coverage as long as they stayed continuously enrolled. But if they discontinued coverage for any reason, insurers could base their premiums on health status. Alternatively, people could receive coverage in state high-risk pools, which the Republican plan would fund with at least $25 billion over 10 years. Experts say that probably wouldn't be enough to provide decent, affordable coverage to the sickest Americans. ####  ##### “What happens to a working-poor person who loses a job and has to go off insurance for a month or two?” Mr. Ornstein asked. “You are putting them back into the situation where for the rest of their lives insurers can deny them coverage.” ####  ##### Harris Meyer writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"MassMutual settles 401(k) suit with employees for $31 million ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, General liability";" ##### Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. has agreed to a nearly $31 million settlement in an excessive-fee lawsuit involving the firm's own retirement plans, joining the ranks of other prominent retirement services providers that have settled allegations over their company 401(k) plans. ####  ##### The class-action lawsuit, Dennis Gordan et al. vs. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. et al., concerned two of MassMutual's retirement plans: the $2.2 billion Thrift Plan and the $200 million Agent Pension Plan, in which MassMutual served as record keeper and investment manager. ####  ##### Plaintiffs, who are current and former plan participants, allege defendants breached their fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by causing unreasonable administrative fees to be charged to the plans, offering high-cost and poor-performing investments, and offering a fixed-income option that was “unduly” risky and expensive. ####  ##### Parties to the lawsuit filed a motion Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking preliminary approval of their settlement agreement, which includes a $30.9 million payment by MassMutual as well as certain non-monetary provisions meant to benefit plan participants. ####  ##### Other firms such as Fidelity Investments and Ameriprise Financial Inc. have settled similar suits alleging excessive 401(k) fees, for $12 million and $27.5 million, respectively. ####  ##### Non-monetary provisions include, in part: ####  ##### • using an independent investment consultant, ensuring participants aren't charged more than $35 for standard record-keeping services and not assessing record-keeping fees on a percentage of assets; ####  ##### • reviewing and evaluating all investment options in the plan; taking into consideration the lowest-cost share class available for each fund, collective investment trust fund and separately managed account alternatives; and passively managed funds for each category or fund offering; and ####  ##### • considering at least three finalists in making an investment selection. ####  ##### “While MassMutual denies the allegations within the complaint and admits no fault or liability, we are pleased to put this matter behind us, avoiding the expense, distraction and uncertainty associated with protracted litigation,” spokesman Michael McNamara said in an e-mailed statement. “Importantly, the amount of the settlement is not material to MassMutual's financial strength, nor its 2016 financial results.” ####  ##### Jerome Schlichter, managing partner at Schlichter, Bogard & Denton L.L.P. and lead attorney for plaintiffs, didn't return a request for comment. ####  ##### Mr. Schlichter and his firm stand to collect attorneys' fees of up to $10.3 million from the MassMutual settlement.

"Court rules UnitedHealthcare can be sued for millions in unpaid bills ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, UnitedHealth Group, General liability, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### A federal court has ruled that an out-of-network Texas hospital system can sue UnitedHealthcare Inc. for $104 million in unpaid hospital bills. ####  ##### In an opinion filed Tuesday, the U.S. District Court in Dallas said Texas General Hospital can bring multiple claims under federal and state law to recover reimbursements that UnitedHealthcare failed to make over a three-year period. ####  ##### Texas General Hospital, based in Grand Prairie, Texas, provided health care services to nearly 2,000 UnitedHealthcare plan members between February 2012 and June 2015, for which the hospital billed the insurer $139.2 million, according to Texas General Hospital L.P. and Texas General GP L.L.C. v. UnitedHealthcare Services Inc. and UnitedHelathcare Insurance Co. ####  ##### Texas General is not included in UnitedHeathcare's provider network, so patients were required to assign their benefits to Texas General prior to getting treated. The hospital also received coverage verification and pre-certification from UnitedHealthcare before services were rendered. ####  ##### But UnitedHealthcare never fully paid up. The health insurer to date has only reimbursed Texas General for $30.1 million of the total amount billed, according to court documents. ####  ##### With patient co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles factored in, Texas General was paid only $35.1 million total for its services, according to the documents. ####  ##### Texas General filed its original suit on June 19, 2015, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, alleging that UnitedHealthcare led the hospital to believe the provided health care services would be covered, then wrongfully denied or reduced coverage and significantly underpaid the hospital. ####  ##### The insurer filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the District Court's chief judge, Barbara M. G. Lynn, said Texas General has made several “plausible” claims to recover benefits. ####  ##### While UnitedHealthcare argued the hospital did not exhaust all administrative remedies, the court said the insurer failed to “provide meaningful access to administrative remedies” and further efforts by the hospital would be futile. ####  ##### The court also found that Texas General can sue for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and promissory estoppel. ####  ##### However, it dismissed the claim that UnitedHealthcare breached fiduciary duty under ERISA, finding that the benefits assignment Texas General received from UnitedHealthcare plan members did not give the hospital standing to sue. #### "

Transamerica Corp. et al., allege breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by Transamerica and affiliated companies for charging excessive administrative and investment management fees. ####  ##### Transamerica, which serves as record keeper and investment manager for its $1.6 billion 401(k) plan, allegedly administered the plan “for the benefit of Aegon” (the firm's parent company) and reaped excess fees for itself through revenue-sharing payments, according to the complaint, originally filed in February 2015. ####  ##### Judge Edward McManus of the U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, granted preliminary approval of the nearly $4 million settlement on June 24. ####  ##### The settlement includes several nonmonetary provisions as well, including: capping fees on a bond index mutual fund, S&P 500 fund and separate account investments; hiring a third-party investment consultant; and continuing to rebate all mutual fund revenue sharing to the plan, to rebate any subadviser fees for affiliated subadvisers to the plan, and to provide record-keeping services to the plan at no cost. ####  ##### ""Although we have maintained that these allegations are unfounded, we have agreed in principle to settle the case in order to avoid the time and expense of litigation,"" Transamerica spokesman Gregory Tucker said in an emailed statement. ""The bulk of the settlement proceeds will be distributed to Transamerica's current and former employees who were participants in the plan … Class members will also have an opportunity to provide comments on the settlement to the court, prior to final approval."" ####  ##### Plaintiffs' counsel Gregory Porter, partner at law firm Bailey & Glasser, didn't return a request for comment. ####  ##### Transamerica joins a growing list of retirement plan service providers that have been targeted in similar excessive-fee lawsuits by their plan participants.

Plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. ####  ##### Plan executives paid record-keeping expenses “far in excess of what a prudent fiduciary would pay for those same services,” the complaint said. “Defendants systematically failed to manage the plan’s investments in a cost-conscious manner.” ####  ##### The complaint also argued that the plan had offered an “imprudently” designed and implemented a custom target-date fund series. Until July 31, 2015, the lawsuit said defendant Shepherd Kaplan L.L.C., an investment adviser, was a “named investment fiduciary” that designed the custom target-date series. The firm was replaced as “named investment fiduciary” by Callan Associates, the lawsuit said. In March, the Fujitsu 401(k) plan replaced the target-date series with a new series designed by Callan, the lawsuit added. ####  ##### The Fujitsu Group Defined Contribution and 401(k) Plan had $1.33 billion in assets at the end of 2014, according to a Form 5500 filing with the Department of Labor. ####  ##### Representatives from Fujitsu could not be reached by press time. ####  ##### Robert Steyer writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Cost-conscious employers revisit HMOs";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Health insurers and employers are limiting plan members' choice of doctors and hospitals in a revamp of the once-popular health maintenance organization model that focused on runaway health costs. ####  ##### Now, however, provider networks are being tightened to include only those lower-cost doctors and other providers who also produce better outcomes and improve patient satisfaction. ####  ##### In late June, citing high costs and massive projected losses, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota said it will offer only a narrow-network HMO to state residents who don't have employer-sponsored coverage. More than 100,000 people will have to find new coverage for 2017, according to the insurer. ####  ##### BCBS has company in shifting to narrower networks, which limit the doctors patients can see and hospitals they can use without paying higher out-of-network charges. On public insurance exchanges established under the health care reform law, about half of plans had a narrow network in 2015, and median premiums for narrow networks were as much as 23% less than those for broad-network plans, according to a McKinsey & Co. study. ####  ##### Employers are showing greater interest as well. In 2015, 26% of large employers offered “high-performance networks” — or narrow networks based on quality and cost — in some or all of their plans, according to the Washington-based National Business Group on Health. ####  ##### “We think that there's going to be a strong future,” for high-performance networks, said Steve Wojcik, NBGH vice president of public policy. ####  ##### The tactic, which sources say limits wasteful use of health care services, is not without its controversy. ####  ##### Narrow networks, made popular by HMOs that became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, resulted in consumer rebellion against the limited choices of doctors and hospitals. Some critics say the approach often requires patients to travel farther to get care, and others argue many narrow networks lack enough specialists. ####  ##### “Consumer choice was extraordinarily high on the consumer preference list” a few decades ago, said Dr. A. Mark Fendrick, director of the Center for Value-based Insurance Design at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a professor of internal medicine and health management and policy. ####  ##### But as health costs have risen and individuals' share of the costs increased, there's been “a shift in terms of consumers willing to give up ultimate unlimited choice to be able to save some out-of-pocket expenses,” he said. ####  ##### For example, out-of-pocket spending for hospitalizations of patients with private health coverage rose 37.3% from 2009 to 2013, when it reached $1,013 on average, according to a study published in June by JAMA Internal Medicine and conducted by researchers with the University of Michigan. ####  ##### “This is a much more blunt instrument to try to control demand by the employees,” versus high-deductible health plans, which attempt “to get employees to use less of all care,” he said. ####  ##### “A narrow network to us from a design standpoint is if we could have certain hospitals that we steer our employees to that says this is a good hospital for this type of procedure, we know your procedure is going to be even better … so we will incent you to go to those good hospitals,” said Carol Partington, employee benefits and compensation manager at Oak Brook, Illinois-based Elkay Manufacturing Co., a maker of stainless steel sinks. ####  ##### Elkay introduced a narrow network for specialty surgeries, such as heart or knee surgery, in January. For employees who use one of the in-network hospitals, determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield based on outcomes data, Elkay will pay 90% of the employee's cost after the deductible, rather than the usual 80%. ####  ##### Elkay, however, does not have a narrow network for primary care visits. ####  ##### “It made more sense for the specialty surgeries because those are where your costs are,” Ms. Partington said. ####  ##### But few other employers use narrow networks because “there are not a ton of high-performing networks out there that have demonstrated over time that they are effective,” said Dan Graovac, Boston-based principal of health exchange solutions with Xerox HR Services. ####  ##### For a large employer with employees across the country, the narrow network strategy is more difficult to pull off. ####  ##### “They need coverage across many states, and so oftentimes these broad networks are still the general preference of the employers that we work with,” said Trevis Parson, Philadelphia-based chief actuary of health and group benefits at Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. ####  ##### Even so, experts expect high-performance networks to grow in popularity, especially as employers remain cost-conscious. ####  ##### “There's a cost gap that employers are still continuing to have to solve, and they are not just looking at the dollar side of the cost equation anymore; they are also looking at the use side of the cost equation,” Mr. Parson said. “Where do we avoid unnecessary readmissions? How do we manage our message to employees and our contracts with providers in a way that puts programs in place that push away unnecessary use of services and drive better outcomes?” ####  ##### And as HDHPs have become more widespread — 83% of large employers said they would offer an HDHP in 2016, according to the 2015 NBGH study — it's likely narrow networks also will become more common, said Sandra Morris, former senior manager of U.S. benefits design at Procter & Gamble Co. and now the owner of consulting firm About Quality Benefits Design L.L.C. in Cincinnati. #### "
"Employers look to public exchanges for pre-Medicare retiree benefits ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers, Willis Towers Watson";" ##### Amid continuing cost increases, a sizeable majority of employers offering health care coverage to pre-Medicare-eligible retirees expect to change those plans, according to a survey released Tuesday. ####  ##### The Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. survey of 467 employers found that 72% of employers plan to make moderate to significant changes in their pre-65 retiree health programs over the next four years. ####  ##### Just over half — 56% — of surveyed employers are optimistic that the public health insurance exchanges authorized by the 2010 health care reform law and which began operating in 2014 will be an alternative to coverage they now offer their pre-Medicare-eligible retirees by 2018. ####  ##### An advantage to that approach: Lower-income pre-Medicare eligible retirees — those with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level — are eligible for federal premium subsidies for plans purchased in the public exchanges. For example, subsidies are available in 2016 for a family of four collectively earning up to $97,000. ####  ##### The public exchanges are not available to Medicare-eligible retirees. ####  ##### With Medicare not available to younger retirees, “Employers are looking elsewhere for a solution,” John Barkett, Willis Towers Watson’s senior director of policy affairs in Washington, said in a statement. ####  ##### That employer interest in moving pre-Medicare eligible retirees to public exchanges is being fueled by health plan cost increases. For example, employers offering coverage to pre-age 65 retirees expect that without plan changes, cost increases will average 5.7% in 2016, according to the Willis Towers Watson survey. Employers making plan changes expect costs to increase an average of 4.1%. ####  ##### Those expected cost increases are substantially higher than for those offering coverage to older retirees — those at least age 65 — who are eligible to receive the bulk of their coverage through the federal Medicare program. Employers making plan changes for those retirees expect costs in 2016 to increase an average of 2.7%, or 3.3% for those not making changes. ####  ##### The Willis Towers Watson 2016 Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey was taken in January and February of this year. #### "
"Proposal adds twist to health plan opt out rules";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### Proposed IRS regulations that could penalize employers offering financial incentives to certain employees to opt out of company-provided health insurance plans also would shield employers from a health reform law affordability penalty in some cases. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, employers face a $3,240 penalty for each employee whose single-coverage premium exceeds 9.66% of household income — if the employee enrolls in a public exchange health plan and receives a federal premium subsidy. ####  ##### While few employers require employees to pay premiums that would trigger the ACA affordability penalty, rules the IRS proposed earlier this month and effective in 2017 would significantly increase the likelihood of triggering the affordability penalty. ####  ##### Under the rules, employers running the affordability test would have to count the payments they offer to employees who opt out of their health plans, as well as premiums employees are required to make to receive employer coverage. ####  ##### In explaining how the health plan affordability test is to be run, the IRS said the opt-out offer is comparable to pretax contributions employees use to pay their share of the premium for employer-provided health insurance. ####  ##### “In both cases, the employee may purchase the employer-sponsored coverage only at the price of forgoing a specified amount of cash compensation that the employee would otherwise receive — salary, in the case of a salary reduction, or an equal amount of other compensation, in the case of an opt-out payment,” the IRS said. ####  ##### “The economic cost to the employee of the employer-sponsored coverage is the same under both arrangements. Accordingly, the employee's required contribution generally should be determined similarly regardless of the type of payment that an employee must forgo,” the IRS said. ####  ##### Take the case of an employer that requires its employees to pay $100 a month for coverage and gives $200 a month to employees that opt out of company coverage. In that example the employee's cost of coverage, under the IRS rules, would be $300 a month or $3,600 a year, an amount that could, depending on employee income, significantly increase the likelihood of triggering the ACA affordability penalty. ####  ##### “That certainly would have an impact on employers with opt-out arrangements,” said Leslie Anderson, a Mercer L.L.C. partner in Minneapolis. ####  ##### But the IRS also said there's a simple way for employers to avoid the affordability penalty: have employees attest that they and their dependents have coverage through another group health plan, which typically would be through the employee's spouse. ####  ##### “It is a relatively easy fix. Employees would just have to attest that they and dependents have group coverage and then the opt-out payments are excluded in running the affordability test,” said Rich Stover, a principal at Xerox HR Services in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### The IRS' proposed rules “will not adversely affect employers' affordability test as long as employers do some upfront work,” said Molly Iacovoni, an Aon Hewitt partner in Lincolnshire, Illinois. ####  ##### Still, with a 2017 effective date, employers will have to move quickly to obtain the required health plan coverage attestation forms from employees, said Ed Fensholt, senior vice president and director of compliance services at Lockton Cos. L.L.C.'s benefit group in Kansas City, Missouri. ####  ##### A small but still substantial number of employers offer opt-out arrangements. For example, a 2015 Mercer survey found that 13% of employers with at least 500 employees offered opt-out arrangements with an average payment of $1,879 per year. ####  ##### Such arrangements are a “win-win for all,” said Lockton's Mr. Fensholt, since employers reduce their health plan costs by having fewer participants and employees who are typically getting coverage through a spouse's employer plan are also getting a cash payment. ####  ##### Based on health care reform law formulas, benefit consultants project the employer penalty for not offering affordable coverage will rise to $3,390 in 2017, while the premium affordability income trigger will rise to 9.69% of family income. #### "
"Justice Department nearing decision on health insurer mergers ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Roughly a year since four major U.S. health insurers struck deals to merge, federal antitrust regulators are close to issuing a decision. ####  ##### Proposed deals to combine Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc., as well as Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. are nearing the tipping point: Aetna this week secured its 18th of 20 approvals needed to take over rival Humana, an Aetna spokesman said. ####  ##### New York state insurance regulators gave conditional approval of the merger, Bloomberg reported Monday. A spokesman for the New York Department of Financial Services declined to confirm the approval. ####  ##### Next up, Georgia is scheduled to hold a public hearing July 26 on the proposed $37 billion Anthem-Cigna deal. The $54.2 billion Anthem-Cigna deal is farther behind with 12 of 26 necessary state approvals. ####  ##### However, the U.S. Justice Department is expected to make a decision in both deals as soon as mid-July. ####  ##### Aetna on Friday reportedly met with Justice Department officials to make its case, just two weeks after a similar meeting between regulators and Anthem and Cigna executives, according to Bloomberg. ####  ##### Aetna-Humana more likely ####  ##### Generally, analysts agree that the Aetna-Humana deal is more likely to win approval than the Anthem-Cigna merger, but most observers caution that the deals are unprecedented and make predictions difficult to make. ####  ##### “I don't see it happening,” said Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc., referring to the Anthem-Cigna deal. As for Aetna's merger with Humana, “I'm more confident.” ####  ##### “We still see this deal getting done,” Thomas A. Carroll, analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., said of the Aetna-Humana deal in a research note last week. ####  ##### Analyst Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners L.L.C. estimates that the Aetna-Humana deal has an 80% chance of closing, while the Anthem-Cigna merger has a less than 50% chance, according to recent research notes. ####  ##### The Justice Department's review focuses on the impact of the proposed mergers on competition, and whether certain divestitures could maintain competition, antitrust experts say. ####  ##### Concerns about the Aetna and Humana merger largely revolve around its impact on competition in the Medicare Advantage market. Aetna and Humana combined would cover about 4.5 million out of a total 17.6 million individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans — nearly a quarter of the market. But the combined organization would cover only 8% of the entire Medicare market, including traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage, according to the Center for American Progress. ####  ##### Aetna's position has been that Medicare Advantage and Medicare compete, thus lessening post-merger competition concerns. Historically, however, the Justice Department has considered them to be two distinct markets that don't compete, said Thomas Greaney, an antitrust expert formerly with the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now co-director of the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University School of Law. ####  ##### Anthem and Cigna deal mainly with the employer market and cater to many self-insured employers who contract only for administrative services. Analysts say there are few administrative services providers to absorb divestitures. ####  ##### If the Justice Department were to sue and a judge block the mergers, Anthem would owe Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee, and Aetna would owe Humana $1 billion, according to their merger agreements. ####  ##### Both Anthem and Aetna should be able to stomach those losses, as they've been building cash this year to subsidize the mergers, said James Sung, associate director and insurance credit analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. ####  ##### Even without Humana, Aetna will remain stable, Mr. Zaharuk said. ####  ##### “It was a nice strategic move to buy Humana, (but) I don't think it's necessary for Aetna in its overall strategic plans,” he said. ####  ##### On the other hand, Anthem was looking to become “more of a national company” beyond the 14 states where it sells insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield name, he said. Without the Cigna deal, Anthem will have to go “back to the drawing board, and they are going to have to reset their strategy.” #### "
"Health insurer mergers in jeopardy after suit cites competitive concerns";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### The U.S. Justice Department's strong objections to merging Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc. with Humana Inc., outlined in federal litigation filed last month, have left significant doubt about either deal being completed. ####  ##### Many analysts hold that the $37 billion Aetna-Humana tie-up has a stronger chance of winning approval than the $54 billion Anthem-Cigna union. ####  ##### “We believe that a settlement including divestitures is still probable, and in fact, we think that Aetna has a relatively strong case should this eventually make it to court,” Barclays P.L.C. analysts said in a research report. ####  ##### However, Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc., said “the deck seems to be stacked against” the Anthem-Cigna combination. ####  ##### “We see the likelihood of any settlement or win for the companies in court as slim given the political nature of the outcome and the tone of the communication” from the Justice Department, Leerink Partners L.L.C. Managing Director and Analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note after the Justice Department litigation. ####  ##### In lawsuits filed July 21 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department objected to the potential deals on anticompetitive grounds and suggested that there were no circumstances in which it would change its mind. ####  ##### If allowed, the mergers that are “unprecedented in their scope and in their scale” would likely “threaten to increase insurance premiums, to reduce benefits, to lower the quality of health care and to slow innovation,” Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General William Baer said during a news conference about the litigation. ####  ##### Aetna, Humana and Anthem quickly responded to the Justice Department's decision with vows to fight (see related story), each arguing that the mergers would benefit consumers and not harm competition. ####  ##### Cigna, on the other hand, seemed less enthusiastic in its initial response, stating that it would evaluate its options and that it expected the transaction to close in 2017, “if at all.” ####  ##### On Friday, however, Cigna President and CEO David Cordani attempted to dispel concerns about the insurer's commitment, saying it is “fully engaged” in the merger process with Anthem. He also said that in case the merger is blocked, Cigna will have significant capital to seek growth opportunities elsewhere. ####  ##### As of late last Friday, Anthem was the only insurer to file a response to the Justice Department's litigation. Anthem also has asked for a speedy antitrust trial, though government attorneys late last week urged the court not to rush the complex case. Aetna and Humana also motioned for an expedited trial due to merger agreement deadlines, according to court documents. ####  ##### Competition objections ####  ##### The Justice Department's objections to the Aetna-Humana combination center largely on reduced competition in the Medicare Advantage market that would result from the merger. Humana, the second-largest Medicare Advantage provider by covered members, competes with Aetna, the fourth-largest, in nearly 90% of the counties where Aetna offers Medicare Advantage. ####  ##### The Justice Department holds that Medicare Advantage does not compete with traditional Medicare. Aetna and Humana disagree. ####  ##### Barclays analysts said in a research note after the Justice Department suit that the federal agency did not make a compelling argument why the two markets don't compete, adding that both cater to seniors and offer the same base benefits. ####  ##### However, the fact that seniors have the choice between the two products “doesn't mean they are substitutes,” said Thomas Greaney, an antitrust expert formerly with the Justice Department's antitrust division who now is co-director of the Center for Health Law Studies at St. Louis University School of Law. ####  ##### Medicare Advantage has distinct characteristics, such as greater benefits, lower premiums and a cap on annual out-of-pocket costs, according to the Justice Department's lawsuit. ####  ##### At the heart of the Justice Department's objections to the Anthem-Cigna union is reduced competition for health insurance and administrative services in the national and local employer markets. ####  ##### The Justice Department also argues that eliminating Cigna as a competitor to Anthem would reduce innovation in moving toward value-based care in the health insurance industry — a major movement today to reduce health care costs. ####  ##### “That's been a factor in some antitrust merger cases, the fact that one company that's merging ... is a maverick,” Mr. Greaney said. In that case, “you're losing the one that puts price and innovation pressure on the others.” ####  ##### The Justice Department also argued that the mergers would harm competition that holds down prices on public health insurance exchanges, and Mr. Baer said divestitures proposed until that point were “incomplete and impractical” and unlikely to solve any antitrust concerns. ####  ##### Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini countered during a CNBC interview July 21 that Aetna has provided “two separate bidders with complete bids, signable contracts that would buy the whole business from us” in each of the problem markets the Justice Department pinpointed. ####  ##### Even so, sources said post-merger divestitures often fail to restore competition. ####  ##### Decided in the courts ####  ##### Ultimately, it's not the Justice Department's call whether the five largest national health insurers become three, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. being the largest and not involved in the mergers, said Andrea Murino, a Washington-based partner and co-chair of the antitrust group at Goodwin Procter L.L.P. ####  ##### It's unclear how U.S. District Court Judge John D. Bates, who has been assigned to the cases, will rule. ####  ##### However, federal antitrust enforcers have “been on a hot streak” of winning antitrust cases lately, Ms. Murino said. ####  ##### In the past two years, several large companies have abandoned merger plans after the Justice Department filed suit. They include Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Inc., General Electric Co. and AB Electrolux, and National CineMedia Inc. and Screenvision L.L.C. ####  ##### Still, federal courts ruled against the Federal Trade Commission twice this year in cases brought against hospital mergers in Chicago and Pennsylvania. The FTC has appealed both. ####  ##### There's also political tension in merger cases, Ms. Murino said. Antitrust law appears to be at odds with the Affordable Care Act, which seems to encourage consolidation and collaboration in the health care sector, she said. ####  ##### “The DOJ will tell you that — and the FTC would say this, too — that there's no tension between the ACA and the antitrust laws, but I bet if you asked (the health insurers') lawyers, they would say there very much is,” Ms. Murino said. ####  ##### Litigation could take months, and the losing party could appeal the decision, Mr. Greaney said. ####  ##### Observers say the outcome of the litigation may not be known until next year. ####  ##### If the deals are blocked, Anthem would owe Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee and Aetna would owe Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, according to their merger agreements. ####  ##### Anthem and Aetna have the cash to pay those fees, sources say, and the fees would give Cigna and Humana opportunities to expand, Mr. Zaharuk said. ####  ##### The insurers could turn their sights to “less transformational” deals with smaller health insurers, as they've done in the past, said Mark Rouck, Chicago-based senior director with Fitch Ratings Inc. #### "

For Medicare-eligible players who played more than 10 years, that coverage will be extended to spouses. ####  ##### ""It's important that we take care of our entire extended NBA family, and I'm proud of my fellow players for taking this unprecedented step to ensure the health and well-being of our predecessors,” union President Chris Paul, a point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers, said in the statement. #### "

But in its Monday results statement, Express Scripts said it began amortizing the agreement in March, which has led to an “additional $31.7 million of revenue amortization recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2016, and $42.2 million of revenue amortization recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016.” ####  ##### For the first half of the year, Express Scripts’ revenues decreased 0.6% to $50.01 billion, compared with $50.35 in the same period last year, according to the statement.

"New York Life sued by employees claiming excessive 401(k) fees ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, General liability";" ##### New York Life Insurance Co. is the newest addition to the ever-growing list of asset managers and retirement plan providers being sued by their employees for fiduciary breach in the company 401(k) plan. ####  ##### Current participants in two New York Life 401(k) plans filed a class-action lawsuit — Andrus et al. vs. New York Life Insurance Co. et al. — alleging self-dealing by the firm and other affiliated fiduciaries for retention of a MainStay-branded S&P 500 index mutual fund in two company retirement plans. ####  ##### The MainStay brand of funds is owned and operated by New York Life and subsidiaries, and the entities “improperly and unjustly benefited from the excessive fees and expenses,” according to the complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ####  ##### “A prudent fiduciary managing the plans in a process that was not tainted by self-interest would have removed the MainStay S&P 500 index fund from the plans,” the complaint said. ####  ##### Rather, by not investigating availability of lower-cost funds between 2010 and the present, plan fiduciaries breached their duties of loyalty and prudence under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plaintiffs allege. ####  ##### The MainStay fund cost 35 basis points, whereas a similar mutual fund offered by Vanguard Group cost two basis points and a collective investment trust fund offered by State Street Global Advisors cost four basis points, the complaint said. ####  ##### Retaining the MainStay fund ultimately caused participants in the two 401(k) plans — the $2.5 billion Employee Progress-Sharing Plan and the $600 million Agents Progress-Sharing Plan — to overpay by nearly $3 million, plaintiffs claim. ####  ##### They say that of the 750 defined contribution plans with more $1 billion in assets, none other than New York Life's two plans offered the MainStay fund. However, more than 250 plans offered the Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, and at least 70 plans offered State Street's CIT. ####  ##### New York Life spokesman Kevin Maher said the firm is reviewing the case and doesn't have a comment on it at this time. ####  ##### Asset managers and record-keeping firms increasingly are being targeted by employees over their own retirement plans. Earlier in July, American Century Cos Inc., the parent of American Century Investments, was sued for self-dealing related to proprietary fund offerings in its 401(k) plan. ####  ##### That followed similar suits filed last year against Allianz Global Investors, Pacific Investment Management Co. and their parent company, Allianz Asset Management, as well as another against Putnam Investments. ####  ##### Other asset managers such Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. and MFS Investment Management, which have 401(k) plans loaded with proprietary funds, are ripe targets for litigation, lawyers say. ####  ##### More broadly, 401(k) lawsuits alleging fiduciary breach for excessive fees have proliferated in the last decade or so, as such legal matters have generally met success and paid out big settlements to plaintiffs and their attorneys. ####  ##### Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Transamerica settled allegations involving their retirement plans this year, for $31 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Ameriprise Financial and Fidelity Investments also paid out multimillion-dollar settlements over the past two years. ####  ##### The New York Life suit was filed by the law firm Nichols Kaster, which is very familiar with these types of self-dealing cases — it is representing plaintiffs in the cases against American Century, Allianz and Putnam. ####  ##### em>Greg Iacurci writes for InvestmentNews, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Express Scripts releases list of costly drugs it won't cover for 2017";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### (Reuters) — Express Scripts Holding Co. said on Monday it would add a handful of medicines in 2017 to its list of drugs that are excluded from insurance coverage, including treatments for arthritis and psoriasis, while several other medicines will be removed from the exclusion list. ####  ##### The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager has been excluding medicines from its coverage list since 2014, citing concern about costs to its health insurers and corporate customers. The 2017 excluded medicines list will entail 85 drugs, it said, compared with 87 in 2016. ####  ##### By excluding drugs from its formulary, Express Scripts said it has been better able to negotiate lower prices from drugmakers, and will thereby save customers an estimated $1.8 billion in 2017, up from $1.3 billion this year. The coverage list determines whether millions of people with private insurance can easily use an insurance co-pay to buy their medicine. ####  ##### The drugs that will be newly excluded in 2017 include Zyclara, a skin cream for actinic keratosis sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., a Canadian drugmaker that has been criticized for big price increases on its products. The condition involves scaly skin growths that can develop into skin cancer. ####  ##### An Express Scripts spokesman declined to comment whether Zyclara, which costs more than $1,100 a tube, or other specific drugs, have been excluded because of price hikes. ####  ##### Other drugs that will be newly excluded from coverage next year include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s arthritis treatment Orencia, Eli Lilly and Co.'s new Taltz treatment for psoriasis and brands of gout drug colchicine sold by privately held Prasco Laboratories and West Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp., a unit of Hikma. ####  ##### Express Scripts said a number of drugs excluded in 2016 will no longer be excluded next year, including Pfizer Inc.'s arthritis drugs Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR and GlaxoSmithKline P.L.C.'s Arnuity Ellipta and Flovent Diskus asthma treatments. ####  ##### All four of the drugs will instead be considered “preferred alternatives,” following price negotiations between the drugmakers and Express Scripts. The spokesman declined to say what magnitude or price rebates his company may have won. ####  ##### Two costly drugs for hepatitis C from Gilead Sciences Inc., Epclusa and Harvoni, remain on the 2016 excluded medications list, he said. But he said their status could change in 2017, with an announcement to be made later this year. #### "
"High-deductible health plans surge in popularity";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### To stem ever-escalating group health plan costs and avoid the hotly debated Cadillac tax, employers have escalated adoption of high-deductible health plans, which may mean preferred provider organization and health maintenance organization plans are on their way out. ####  ##### Employers last year continued to tweak their group plan designs as growth in health costs, plus the pressure of the 40% excise tax, made changes a priority. ####  ##### But even with the fear of the Cadillac tax, employers have steered clear of sweeping measures. ####  ##### “Because there's been relatively modest (health care cost) trend year over year, employers have not done drastic things with plan design, with or without the Affordable Care Act,” said David Fortosis, Chicago-based senior vice president and health care consultant at Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### Health care costs increased 3.2% in 2015 after employers made plan design changes, down from 4.4% in 2014, Aon Hewitt said in a November survey. That's the lowest increase recorded since Aon Hewitt began tracking the data in 1996. ####  ##### Many employers are waiting to see whether the Cadillac tax, now delayed until 2020, will be repealed before making major design changes, sources said. ####  ##### Employers most often have been “tweaking” their plan designs, Mr. Fortosis said. ####  ##### Still, small adjustments can lead to big savings, sources said. And shifting costs to employees is an obvious starting point to limit rising costs. ####  ##### “More employers are adding the high-deductible plan option, and more employers are creating stronger financial incentives for employees to enroll in that plan,” said Ed Kaplan, national health practice leader at The Segal Group Inc. in New York. HDHPs “tend to lower claim costs so that you either avoid the tax or push out the potential tax liability several years.” ####  ##### The National Business Group on Health pegs the percentage of large employers planning to offer a consumer-driven health plan in 2016 at 83% and more than one-third intend that CDHP to be the only option, according to an August survey. ####  ##### To illustrate, the medical cost per employee enrolled in a CDHP linked to a health savings account averages $9,228 compared with $11,212 for PPOs and $11,248 for HMOs, Mercer L.L.C. said in a November survey. ####  ##### Employers also are charging more to cover employee's spouses, and interest is growing in self-funding health coverage, experts say. The trend does not bode well for conventional PPOs and HMOs, some say. ####  ##### Bruce Elliott, Alexandria, Virginia-based manager of compensation and benefits at the Society for Human Resource Management, said traditional PPOs with low deductibles could eventually “could go the way of the dodo” bird. ####  ##### If PPOs and HMOs continue, “we're going to see increased deductibles, (and) we're going to see reduced coinsurance rates. In other words, they are going to put more on the employee,” he said. ####  ##### “It depends on the industry you're talking about,” said Segal's Mr. Kaplan. In retail, where salaries are lower and turnover is higher, workers may be moved into lower-cost plans. But in industries with richer benefits, such as the public sector, workers “want a rich option,” he said. ####  ##### Sometimes employees make the choice. ####  ##### At Tamarac, Florida-based City Furniture Inc., 80% of workers are in an HDHP linked to a health reimbursement arrangement, said Janet Wincko, City Furniture's vice president of employee benefits. Only 20% remain in the firm's HMO, which is extremely pricey, Ms. Wincko said. ####  ##### Also hanging in the balance is the fate of HSAs and HRAs. Without them, employees would shoulder the entire deductible and be more likely to skimp on necessary care, and employers would not be as attractive to prospective workers. ####  ##### “If (employers) are approaching the Cadillac tax thresholds, the low-hanging fruit is the HSA, which is upsetting because that's the way (employers) are offsetting the high deductible,” said Brian Marcotte, president of the NBGH in Washington. ####  ##### Employer and employee pretax contributions to HSAs, HRAs and flexible spending accounts are to be included in the Cadillac tax calculation. ####  ##### According to the NBGH survey, 58% of employers will contribute a predetermined amount to each plan participant's HSA and 59% will do so for those enrolled in HRAs in 2016. ####  ##### Those accounts are “the easiest thing for the employer to eliminate if they're either going to trigger the tax or if it's looking like it's getting close,” said Riverside, California-based Sibyl Bogardus, Hub International Ltd.'s chief compliance officer for the Western region. While only pretax contributions are counted now, she said post-tax employer contributions “may be pulled in to that calculation as well” in the future. ####  ##### And while private exchanges haven't seen the uptake initially predicted, interest continues to climb. ####  ##### According to Mercer's November study, 6% of large employers already use a private exchange for active employees or will by next year's open enrollment, a 50% increase from the year before. Furthermore, 27% of large employers are considering switching to a private exchange in the next five years. ####  ##### Much of the movement depends on the future of the Cadillac tax, sources said. #### "
"Employers strive to control health costs in anticipation of 2018 excise tax";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### Most large and midsize employers that offer health insurance to their employees are maintaining it this year, but they're still looking to limit their costs. ####  ##### Many employers face health care costs that are projected to increase in the single-digit range as well as taxes and fees related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. They're also taking steps to avoid the 40% excise tax on high-cost health plans that will go into effect in 2018. ####  ##### Based on various employer surveys, one-third to more than half of large employers are on a trajectory to hit that tax in 2018. ####  ##### “That's why we've been seeing pretty bold (cost-containment) strategies for a couple of years now,” said Tracy Watts, a Washington-based senior partner and national health reform leader at consultant Mercer L.L.C. ####  ##### For example, Mercer data shows that employers expect an average increase of 4.6% in health care costs this year, but it would have been 7.1% had they not made changes to their plans. ####  ##### In contrast to recent years, when benefits enhancements such as banning lifetime limits and expanding coverage to adult children resulted in major changes due to the ACA, 2015 is “a fairly quiet year for major plan changes among large employers,” said Randy Abbott, a Boston-based senior consultant and health and benefits group practice leader at Towers Watson & Co. ####  ##### By and large, midsize employers did not make huge benefit plan changes for 2015, although there was a continued migration to high-deductible health plans, said Rebecca McLaughlan, vice president of health and benefits at Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C., in Troy, Michigan. However, some retail and service businesses reduced worker hours or added lower-cost health plans with higher employee contribution rates to comply with the ACA's mandate to provide coverage to employees, she said. ####  ##### For the future, nearly four in five midsize to large employers expect to make some change by 2017 in benefits offered to full-time employees, according to a Towers Watson study. Benefits consultants expect even more action as 2018 approaches. Mercer estimates about one-third of employers would be subject to the excise tax without changes to their health plans. ####  ##### The excise tax, which is to be levied on plans that cost more than $10,200 a year for individuals and $27,500 for a family, could force Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. to scrap its standard preferred provider organization plan as early as 2016, said Tim Quitmeyer, the real estate management and investment firm's vice president of benefits. The company has informed its roughly 15,000 benefits-eligible U.S. employees and, for now, is taking a wait-and-see approach, he said. ####  ##### Rick Wald, Minneapolis-based director and national practice leader at Deloitte Consulting L.L.P.'s employer health care consulting practice, said “a fair number of employers (are) still holding their breath, seeing what the new Congress will do.” ####  ##### In the meantime, Jones Lang hopes to expand enrollment in its two high-deductible plans, with in-network deductibles of $1,300 to $6,750 depending on the plan and the number of people covered, through employee education and tech tools to help individuals and families gauge health care spending. ####  ##### Many employer benefit plans nudged up deductibles, coinsurance and premium contributions for 2015, several surveys show. ####  ##### Caterpillar Inc. is replacing fixed-dollar copays on certain prescription drug tiers with coinsurance due to rapidly growing costs. A spokeswoman for the Peoria, Illinois-based company declined comment, but in an overview of health benefit changes, Caterpillar said “copays have not increased since 2004 for most participants” and that brand name drugs, which the heavy equipment maker said tripled in cost in 10 years, and growing prevalence of high-cost specialty drugs were major reasons for the move. ####  ##### Employers also are migrating to high-deductible health plans. ####  ##### More than half of large employers are adding or expanding consumer-driven health plans, and those offering such plans as their only option jumped 10 percentage points to 32% this year, according to the National Business Group on Health's annual employer survey. ####  ##### New York-based McGraw-Hill Education adopted two new CDHPs this year, replacing its standard PPO and a different CDHP, according to the company's open enrollment materials. The New York-based educational content provider declined to comment. ####  ##### Roughly one-third of employers are considering a surcharge for spouses who have health insurance through their own employer or excluded spouses from coverage, according to Towers Watson data. ####  ##### Outcomes-based incentives also are becoming more prevalent, benefits experts said. Towers Watson's survey predicted a 10% increase in the number of employers taking that approach this year, with another 48% considering it for 2016 or 2017. ####  ##### Although the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed several suits challenging wellness programs that penalize employees for nonparticipation, Steve Flores, an associate in the Chicago office of Winston & Strawn L.L.P., said the law firm is not advising clients to pull the plug on wellness plans.  Until the litigation plays out, what employers can do is make sure their programs “are communicated as an incentive and not a penalty,” he said. ####  ##### Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the nation's fourth-largest school district with about 40,000 full-time benefits-eligible employees, has extended its incentive for employees to have an annual physical, participate in biometric screening and complete a health risk assessment. Employees who meet wellness goals by Sept. 30 may select a narrow-network plan with no premium for employee-only coverage. ####  ##### By encouraging employee participation in wellness activities, the district hopes to raise employee awareness of health risks and encourage them to take action that, in turn, will save the school district money. ####  ##### Facing potential excise taxes of almost $17 million in 2018 and $40 million in 2020, the school district also is exploring adding a CDHP for 2016, said Scott Clark, the district's Miami-based risk and benefits officer. ####  ##### Adding a CDHP won't solve the excise tax issue, but it will begin “to chip away at it,” said Mr. Clark, a former president of the Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc., adding that the district will seek proposals this year for a tool that will help employees shop for the most cost-effective health care facilities. ####  ##### While employers are interested in private health insurance exchanges to provide benefits to their workers, only 3% of large employers have made the move, according to Mercer data. ####  ##### For some employers, private exchanges are “a logical choice,” said Karen Marlo, a vice president at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. ####  ##### The retail and hospitality industries, for example, have moved to exchanges in greater numbers because many employers expanded coverage to employees who work at least 30 hours a week. But for companies doing a good job controlling costs, private exchanges are “not the right model at this time,” she said. #### "
"UPS' switch to a private health insurance exchange provides more options";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### United Parcel Service Inc. and about 8,000 of its age-65-and-older Medicare-eligible non-union retirees are reaping the benefits of the Atlanta-based package delivery company moving health care coverage to a private insurance exchange. ####  ##### For years, UPS offered a single self-insured health plan to Medicare-eligible retirees. ####  ##### “There was no choice. It was one size fits all,” said Al Rapp, corporate health care manager at UPS. “We didn't think it was a great value” in many cases for retirees. ####  ##### In 2011, UPS decided on another approach. It contracted, effective Jan. 1, 2012, with Aon Hewitt to offer coverage to the retirees through an insurance exchange — Aon Hewitt Navigators. ####  ##### Now, the retirees, depending on where they reside, can have nearly three dozen plans from which to choose to find one that best fits their health care needs. ####  ##### “We knew that providing choices would be a lot better than what retirees had before,” Mr. Rapp said. ####  ##### The retirees apply UPS contributions toward the premium charged by the plans. If the UPS contribution is more than the premium charged by the plan, retirees then can apply the difference to pay for out-of-pocket expenses, such as costs that fall under a plan's deductible. ####  ##### To prevent confusion, the exchange provides benefit advisers to help the retirees evaluate and select an appropriate health plan. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “The retirees quickly saw the value of the benefit advisers and became very positive about the change,” Mr. Rapp said. ####  ##### Retirees also can turn to exchange staff throughout the year for assistance with numerous issues, such as questions about a claim. As a result, UPS no longer has to devote corporate resources to administer the retiree program. ####  ##### “That allows us to concentrate on meeting the many other needs of our people,” Mr. Rapp said. ####  ##### Moving to a private health insurance exchange was not a cost issue as the company's retiree health care plan contribution formula has not changed. ####  ##### “It was a choice issue. We knew the plan choices would be better than what retirees had before,” Mr. Rapp said. #### "
"Alternatives to 'mini-med' health care plans are in the works";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Designs are being developed to provide affordable coverage for employees now enrolled in mini-med health care plans. ####  ##### “We're working on alternative designs” for the 20,000 to 35,000 employees and dependents covered by Western Growers Association's multiple employer welfare arrangement, including “a replacement for the 60% who are in mini-med plans,” said Jonathan Alexander, compliance counsel for the association in Irvine, Calif. ####  ##### The association is considering a plan developed by the California Health Benefit Exchange. ####  ##### “The most affordable (replacement) looks like a high-deductible health plan plus fairly robust coinsurance,” Mr. Alexander said. “It may be a replacement, but not a solution,” he said in citing higher employee costs. ####  ##### Limited-benefit or fixed-indemnity plans, which are structured differently than mini-med plans, pay a fixed amount toward hospital and doctor visits, critical illness, accidents and other charges that “are direct out-of-pocket hits” to the employee, said Christopher Covill, benefits product solution leader at Mercer L.L.C. in Atlanta. ####  ##### “There's a whole host of (supplemental) products out there today. I think there will be an absolute growth in that market,” he said. ####  ##### The fixed-indemnity plans are “excepted” from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, said Joe Murgo, president of Strategic Resource Co., a Columbia, S.C., subsidiary of Aetna Inc. specializing in limited benefit insurance plans. ####  ##### One reason that Aetna's fixed indemnity plans make coverage affordable is they access Aetna's nationwide provider network. Offered as stand-alone products now, they could supplement coverage employees obtain through an exchange to satisfy the individual mandate, he said. ####  ##### Brian Thompson, vice president of special markets for Transamerica Employee Benefits in Atlanta, said employers that offer mini-med plans have been migrating to limited-benefit plans since 2011. Transamerica offers limited benefit plans that could supplement the exchanges' plans and is developing new products “to cover the new points of risk an employee has in the market today,” he said. #### "
"Benefit changes better understood with targeted messages";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Employers that want their employees to better understand their benefits could borrow tactics used by advertisers and marketers: Know your audience and customize the message to meet their personal needs. ####  ##### So say benefits communications experts who are trying to get their clients to do just that to ensure employees know how ever-changing benefits such as health care and retirement affect them. ####  ##### “Everyone is so busy, and in this economy employees are being asked to do more with less and are being asked to manage their own benefits,” said Betsy Woods Brooks, a Stamford, Conn.-based principal in the communication practice of Buck Consultants L.L.C., adding that the shifts toward defined contribution retirement and consumer-driven health plans have helped create a maze of confusion among workers. “It's putting more personal ownership and accountability into managing your benefits. All of that requires greater understanding.” ####  ##### As a recent survey reveals and experts agree on, nearly half of employees are not getting the message. ####  ##### In December 2011, an ADP/Human Resources Pulse survey ADP HR/Benefits Pulse Survey on Employee Benefits Tools revealed that 40% of employees do not understand their benefits plans, according to human resource decision-makers. ####  ##### That figure doesn't surprise benefits communications experts, who said the challenge is multipronged: Benefits designs are calling for more employee decisions that put more power in the hands of workers, plans are more complicated than ever, and workers are bombarded with information every day, left to sift through what's important and relevant to them. ####  ##### “It's just a complicated alphabet soup for some people,” said Ann Bongiani, Seattle-based senior consultant for Towers Watson & Co. ####  ##### “There are some complicated issues on how to manage the health care system...these tend to lull people to sleep,” said P.J. Waters, a communications consultant with Lockton Cos. L.L.C. based in San Diego. “Appreciating our audience is definitely the first step.” ####  ##### “Most companies are still using a one-size-fits-all approach,” said Ms. Bongiani of what she says is one of the biggest pitfalls in presenting benefits information to employees. ####  ##### The term “targeted communications” is not a new one in the realm of human resources, but it is one that is becoming more commonplace as benefits get more complicated and the workforce more diverse. ####  ##### “Employers and human resources have always tried to emulate consumer marketers and haven't always been successful,” said Ms. Brooks of Buck Consultants. “Now they have a greater need to do that.” ####  ##### “We have to understand that our employees are in a highly customizable world now, and we need to look at how we can (accommodate) that,” said Jim Hoff, Chicago-based partner with the communication practice of Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### An obvious but often overlooked problem with human resource communications is the language barrier in many workplaces, experts say. An easy fix is to rely on translators, said Mr. Waters, whose firm is among those who provide translation as part of their service to employers. ####  ##### Next and most prominent are the various ages of employees, which experts say is tied to how certain demographics best receive information, experts say. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Robin Throckmorton, president of Cincinnati-based Strategic Human Resources Inc., a firm that provides human resources services to small and midsize companies, has examined different age groups of workers and has determined, using research and focus groups, how certain demographics like to obtain their information. ####  ##### The findings? The “radio babies,” another name for anyone born between 1930 and 1945, prefer face-to-face communication; baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, like to learn things in groups; generation X, workers born between 1965 and 1976, prefer email; and generation Y, born between 1977 and 1990, also like email but more and more prefer to receive reminders over mobile phone text messages. ####  ##### This shows that, to get the word out and explain benefits effectively, human resource professionals should use  a variety of ways to communicate (see related story). “You have to keep who you are trying to communicate with in mind when you want to get a message across,” Ms. Throckmorton said. “But you also don't want to alienate your employees.” #### "
"Spectranetics offers employees 24/7 medical access via Paladina Health clinics";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Colorado Springs-based medical device maker Spectranetics Corp. opened an on-site clinic and a near-site clinic last month to give its 325 local employees and their dependents round-the-clock physician access and to support its corporate wellness efforts. ####  ##### Operated by Paladina Health L.L.C., a division of Denver-based DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., both clinics provide a range of medical services including primary and preventive care, chronic condition support and basic urgent care, and help for patients to navigate specialty and hospital-based care, said Rob Fuchs, senior vice president of human resources. ####  ##### “When you think about what's happening in health care today, it's certainly confusing,” Mr. Fuchs said. “Physician engagement feels rushed.” ####  ##### With Paladina's patient-to-doctor ratio of 600 to 800 patients per doctor, compared with the average private practitioner load of 2,300 to 3,000 patients, “the model is proactive about health,” he said. Patients also can access their clinic doctor via telephone or the Internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ####  ##### To encourage employees and their dependents to use the clinic, Spectranetics is waiving copays and deductibles. Spectranetics also uses the clinics to provide biometric screenings. ####  ##### The company's health plan administrator, Aetna Inc., also is working with Paladina to collect clinic encounter data and combine it with other claims data to ensure plan members are receiving appropriate and recommended care, Mr. Fuchs said. ####  ##### “We're a self-insured company.

"Stream of pricey cancer drugs to hit employer costs";"Benefits Management";"Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — Expensive specialty drugs, one-third of which are for cancer, give patients greater hope, but insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and employers need to find innovative ways to deal with the escalating costs. ####  ##### “If you look at the drug pipeline, it is more robust than any time in my 35 years of health care,” said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer of St. Louis-based Express Scripts Holding Co. ####  ##### More than 7,000 drugs are in development, and most are specialty medications, he said. And while all won't make it to market, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is approving a record numbers of drugs. ####  ##### While this means “tremendous hope for many unmet medical needs,” Dr. Miller said if payers “don't have solutions on how to manage specialty patients going forward, we're going to get crushed.” ####  ##### According to health care analytics firm IMS Health Inc., prescription drug spending reached $373.9 billion in 2014, up 13.1% from 2013 for the fastest growth rate since 2001. Specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C, cancer and multiple sclerosis drove much of that growth and accounted for one-third of total prescription drug spending, Danbury, Connecticut-based IMS Health said in a report last year. ####  ##### Specialty drugs are “obviously the topic that PBMs and payers are focused on, and we don't think it's going away,” said George Hill, New York-based equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank A.G. ####  ##### Buzz surrounding drug price sticker shock has focused largely on hepatitis C drugs such as Sovaldi, introduced in 2013 with a cost of about $84,000 per course of treatment; and successor Harvoni, which debuted in 2014 at an even higher $94,500 per course. ####  ##### But the biggest issue for employers and other payers is a pipeline of cancer drugs hitting the market, several experts said during the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute's Feb. 29-March 2 conference in Palm Springs, California. ####  ##### “Enormous numbers of drugs are coming out (for) cancer and they are coming out at price points we have never seen before,” Dr. Miller said. “We talk about the average chemotherapy now costing over $100,000 a year, 14 million patients with cancer — you can do the math. We're talking about an enormous spend for cancer.” ####  ##### But experts say it's hard to contain costs when it comes to cancer. ####  ##### “Most oncology drugs are covered under the medical benefit, where there is less oversight,” Mr. Hill said. “It's hard to get very aggressive in cost containment in oncology without looking terrible.” ####  ##### “Cancer was an area in benefit design that, not so many years ago, no one would touch with a 10-foot pole. You were afraid to say no,” said Sharon Frazee, vice president of research and education at Plano, Texas-based PBMI. ####  ##### Still, she said, employers and other payers are “less afraid, more willing to say, ""Let's make reasoned choices; let's work together to do this,' and to explain to people why this drug is preferred over that drug,” she said, adding there's always an appeals process for patients with a medical necessity. ####  ##### Employers and other payers are using cost-sharing tiers and formulary exclusions to control specialty drug costs, experts said. ####  ##### Express Scripts is poised to tackle cancer drug prices using indication-based pricing, which means it will pay more for a drug when it's used for more effective treatment. For example, the PBM will reimburse the drugmaker at a higher rate when Tarceva is used to fight lung cancer versus pancreatic cancer, because the drug is more effective in treating lung cancer, Dr. Miller said. ####  ##### “It's basically disincentiving the overuse of drugs that have very little impact on survival,” Ms. Frazee said. ####  ##### Yet the conversation about high drug prices may help ultimately lower them, Mr. Hill said. ####  ##### “Even the Republicans are talking about drug pricing and drug price control,” he said. “If you continue to gouge the system, you will draw the ire of regulators on both sides.” #### "
"IRS signals grad student health plans need overhaul";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Health Insurers";" ##### The IRS has given colleges and universities more time to scrap long-established health insurance plans offered to student teaching assistants and devise new approaches, but the plans' end looks to be in sight. ####  ##### In Notice 2016-73, the IRS affirmed earlier guidance that a widespread approach colleges and universities use to provide health coverage to students — typically graduate teaching assistants — flunks provisions of the health care reform law. ####  ##### In what the IRS calls “employer payment” plans, schools buy and pay most or all of the premium  for individual policies purchased from commercial insurers. ####  ##### “These arrangements, by their very definition, include dollar limits on the amount of reimbursements or payments, and therefore violate the Affordable Care Act prohibition on annual dollar limits,” the IRS said in its February notice. ####  ##### “The IRS views these students as employees, and therefore you cannot subsidize the cost of individual policies for them,” said Steven Bloom, director of federal relations at the American Council on Education in Washington. ####  ##### The IRS is saying, “No employer can reimburse an employee for all or some of the premium for individual health insurance,” said Rich Stover, a principal at Xerox HR Services in Secaucus, New Jersey. ####  ##### Still, the IRS said it recognizes “schools may need additional time to adopt a suitable alternative or make other arrangements to come into compliance,” and said its rules would not apply for student health plan years starting prior to Jan. 1, 2017. ####  ##### Since health plans typically start with the beginning of college and university academic years in the fall, many schools will have about 18 months to devise new approaches. ####  ##### “This is something colleges and universities will have to address, but at least they will have time,” said J.D. Piro, a senior vice president at Aon Hewitt in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### Benefit experts say colleges and universities will consider several approaches: extending their group health plans to working students, such as teaching assistants, and giving students cash, which they could use to purchase health insurance coverage. ####  ##### “I think many colleges/universities will work to extend eligibility for the employer-sponsored group health plan. This is probably going to end up being the easiest approach because the group health administration structure is already there,” said Jen Faifer, a principal at Mercer L.L.C. in Chicago. ####  ##### The “approach will vary by school depending on needs and student issues,” Xerox's Mr. Stover said. ####  ##### Some schools hope Congress may intervene to block the rules. ####  ##### “The major research universities across the country have mobilized their congressional delegations to address the IRS ruling so that beginning in 2017, we may be able to continue to offer the same insurance coverage that we have always offered,” said a spokeswoman for University of Missouri in Columbia. ####  ##### “We have not given up hope,” said the Mr. Bloom of the American Council on Education. “We are exploring avenues on Capitol Hill. I don't believe this is what the White House thought that this is what the ACA intended to do.” ####  ##### “Colleges and universities are likely to develop some alternative scenarios, but wait until after the election to decide whether to implement them,” said Amy Bergner, managing director of people and organization at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P in Washington. ####  ##### But others doubt Congress will intervene. ####  ##### “It is unlikely that Congress would pass and President Obama would sign legislation impacting the reach of the ACA,” said Andy Anderson, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius L.L.P. in Chicago. ####  ##### In fact, colleges and universities recognize that congressional intervention or the IRS changing its position are far from certain. ####  ##### “Depending on what the relevant agencies advise us, we may have to find a new solution to the problem. While we cannot predict what the agencies will do, we can predict our own institutional behavior,” the University of Missouri spokeswoman said. #### "
"Towers Watson risk transfer program aims to offload retiree health care risks";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### A program that applies aspects of the pension plan risk-reduction concept to employers' retiree health care exposures could provide financial relief to some employers, experts say. ####  ##### But the significant upfront investment needed might be a deterrent, some say. The program, unveiled last week by Towers Watson & Co., would enable employers to eliminate unfunded retiree health care plan liabilities for Medicare-eligible retirees by shifting those liabilities to insurers through the purchase of group annuities. ####  ##### “Retiree health care plan liabilities are a big, big issue for some employers,” said Michael Newman, a partner with the law firm Barger & Wolen L.L.P. in Los Angeles.  “A lot of employers want to defuse those liabilities, but many will wait and see” for results before deciding, Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Under the program, employers would first have to adopt a defined contribution approach for health care coverage offered to Medicare-eligible retirees.  Under that approach, employers agree to make a fixed contribution towards the premiums of health care plans available through Towers Watson's private exchange, with retirees picking up the difference between the credit provided by their employers and the cost of the plan they select. ####  ##### In the risk transfer program, the employer would purchase, paying the full premium upfront, a group annuity from an insurer. The insurer then would provide retirees with a monthly tax-free check, which a retiree would put towards the premium of the plan he or she selects in the Towers Watson Exchange, known as OneExchange, through which dozens of insurers offer coverage. ####  ##### Through the approach, which Towers Watson calls Longitude Solution, an employer would fully shift its retiree health care liabilities, including unknown factors of retiree longevity, to an insurer. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Retiree health care “benefits do not engage or attract new talent, yet they create balance sheet volatility and income statement expense, and divert management time,” Towers Watson said in a written analysis describing the program, claiming those factors would be eliminated through its risk transfer approach. ####  ##### “This seems to be answering an employer need:  to make retiree health care costs more predictable,” Mr. Newman said. ####  ##### Towers Watson now is discussing the approach with clients “and there is considerable employer interest,” said Mitchell Cole, Stamford, Conn.-based managing director of Towers Watson Retiree Insurance Solutions. Towers Watson declined to identify the names of these employers. ####  ##### “It is a risk management mechanism.  It will be undoubtedly used more and more. Some employers will flock to it because it limits their risks,” said Brian Klepper, chief executive officer of the National Business Coalition on Health in Washington. ####  ##### “It is an interesting option for companies to consider especially those that want to eliminate retiree health care obligations from their financial balance sheets,” said Michael Thompson, a principal with Pricewaterhouse-Coopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### Still, experts say, employers have to consider other issues. For example, unlike pension benefits, employers typically have not funded retiree health care benefits. That would mean employers would have to come up with the cash upfront to pay for the group annuity from the insurer they selected. ####  ##### “Employers would have to write a pretty big check. Many companies would rather pay this cost annually than write such a big check right away,” said John Grosso, head of Aon Hewitt's retiree health care task force in Norwalk, Conn. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### The approach is a tradeoff, said Bruce Richards, a partner and chief actuary for health care at Mercer L.L.C. in Richmond, Va. ####  ##### On the one hand, employers could improve their balance sheets, which Mr. Richards said, is a good way for employers to improve their credit ratings. ####  ##### “This will help in keeping your income and balance sheets clean,” Mr. Richards said. ####  ##### On the other hand, purchasing the annuity means an employer will have less money for investments from which it could have earned income, Mr. Richards said. ####  ##### Such risk transfers have been common in the pension arena. In 2012, for example, more than a dozen major employers, including Equifax Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., NCR Corp. and the New York Times Co., offered employees who left but who were not yet receiving benefits, the opportunity to convert their future monthly annuity into a cash lump sum benefit, eliminating an unpredictable future cost and overhead expenses, such as payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### Also, General Motors Co. and Verizon Inc. bought group annuities from Prudential Insurance Co. of America, shifting to Prudential billions of dollars in pension benefits promised to current retirees. #### "

Revenue growth and income growth obviously are among them, but also diversity growth,” said Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Services Inc. ####  ##### “They added a lot of business in the Coventry acquisition, which gives them a lot of new access to growth in some markets where they weren't as strongly represented, both geographically and productwise,” he said. ####  ##### Analysts said Aetna's investment in its private health insurance exchange, Aetna Marketplace, which it launched for small employer groups last year and plans to expand this year, and its participation in several national and regional third-party exchange platforms have positioned it for organic growth in its employer-sponsored segment. ####  ##### “While insurers face real and well-documented headwinds related to (health care reform law) implementation, Aetna's core business continues to grow and evolve,” said Jennifer Lynch, a research analyst at New York-based BMO Capital Markets. “We like the company's dedication to full-risk health insurance and believe, through its proprietary exchange and participation in competing ones, Aetna will harness commercial revenue and earnings growth.” #### "
"How to carefully evaluate third-party administrator pricing";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### TPA pricing ranges from a single administrative services fee to a menu of services with separate prices, making it difficult to make side-by-side comparisons. ####  ##### “It's like going to the grocery store and looking at the fruit stall: apples, oranges, peaches, pears,” said Fred Hunt, active past president of the Society of Professional Benefit Administrators, a Chevy Chase, Md.-based national TPA association. ####  ##### Donald Mollihan, a partner at Phoenix-based Arizona Benefits Consultants L.L.C., has seen TPA prices for claims administration as low as $14 and as high as $25 per employee per month. ####  ##### Depending on its size, an employer group could be charged $30 to $50 per month per employee for all administrative, network and care management services, said Carol Berry, Woodland Hills, Calif.-based chief operating officer of the Health Care Administrators Association, whose members include TPAs. ####  ##### Adam Russo, co-founder and CEO of The Phia Group L.L.C., a Braintree, Mass.-based cost-containment and consulting firm, said price should be the last thing employers consider. ####  ##### One TPA may have a lower administrative fee, but if it relies heavily on computer software to pay or deny claims with little human intervention, a company may end up paying more on claims than it should, he said. ####  ##### “I would rather be with an administrator who's a little bit pricier for admin fees, but I know they have checks and balances in place,” Mr. Russo said. ####  ##### He also thinks employers focus too much on provider network discounts. ####  ##### “Thirty percent off a number — and you don't even know what it is — may or may not be better than 10% off another number,” he said. ####  ##### Mr. Mollihan asks TPAs for a breakout of costs and compares options using a spreadsheet. “You have to look at what's included in their fee structure,” he said. #### "
"Periodic requests for third-party administrator proposals can benefit employers";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Last May, the City of Manhattan, Kan., began soliciting proposals for a third-party administrator to provide services this year. ####  ##### With the exception of 2007, the incumbent for the city's group health plan had served the city from its Wichita, Kan., office since 1998 under various names and owners, most recently as Harrington Health Services Inc. ####  ##### Tampa, Fla.-based HealthPlan Services purchased Harrington Health in March 2011. With the latest ownership change and subsequent staffing cuts, the city no longer thought it was receiving the same level of service and decided to seek new bids, said Cathy Harmes, director of human resources. ####  ##### “It grieved me greatly to have to do it,” she said, but it had been five years since the city had considered a new TPA request for proposals. ####  ##### Harrington submitted a proposal, but it did not make the final cut. ####  ##### “We greatly enjoyed our relationship with them. We were definitely sorry when they decided to terminate their relationship with us,” said Larry Schmidt, vice president of claims, in Harrington Health's Westerville, Ohio, headquarters. ####  ##### With several years of self-funding experience, Manhattan officials knew they wanted to preserve certain elements of their 800-member group health plan. ####  ##### With its new TPA, Overland Park, Kan.,-based CoreSource, a unit of Trustmark Mutual Holding Co., the city retained its grandfathered health plan status and saved roughly $70,000 in fixed costs over 2012. The city also negotiated a new stop-loss agreement that will save $700,000 this year. ####  ##### Harrington's proposal, by contrast, projected a 25% increase in fees for 2014. ####  ##### CoreSource provided continued access to Cigna Corp.'s preferred provider organization network, minimizing employee and dependent disruption while keeping the city's wellness plan. It also continued the city's prescription program and manages direct contracts with local hospitals, physicians, surgeons and other providers — a critical element that yields “better discounts than we could have gotten through Cigna,” Ms. Harmes said. ####  ##### “Do your analysis,” she advised employers looking to change TPAs. Pay close attention to provider discounts and make sure the service agreement language is acceptable before signing the contract, she said. #### "
"Pharmacy benefit manager merger seen driving competition";"Benefits Management";"Prescription Drug Benefits, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### ROCKVILLE, Md.—The $4.4 billion purchase by SXC Health Solutions Corp. of Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. is likely to increase competition among the industry's largest pharmacy benefit managers and could drive prescription discounts for major employers, expert say. ####  ##### The deal announced last week also is a sign that more PBM mergers and acquisitions are on the horizon as companies cope with drug pricing pressures. ####  ##### “We're just at the beginning of acquisitions in this space,” said Brenda Motheral, executive director of the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute in Plano, Texas. ####  ##### SXC and Catalyst said the boards of directors of each company unanimously approved the merger in which Catalyst shareholders will receive $28 in cash and a 0.66 share of SXC stock for each Catalyst share under the transaction, the firms said in a joint statement. ####  ##### The pending acquisition would create an estimated $13 billion company that would be headquartered in Illinois and maintain offices in Maryland, according to last week's statement. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2012, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. ####  ##### SXC reported $4.98 billion in 2011 revenue, while Catalyst reported $5.33 billion in revenue, the PBMs said in their annual reports. ####  ##### Employers are hopeful the merger will result in a major PBM market player that can negotiate prescription pricing deals, said Edward Kaplan, New York-based senior vp and national health practice leader at The Segal Co., an independent benefit, compensation and human resources firm. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “You get to a point where you're big enough where the big manufacturers have to take you seriously, and that should help them negotiate rebate savings,” Mr. Kaplan said. ####  ##### The institute's Ms. Motheral agreed that the deal could mean more prescription discounts. ####  ##### “For larger employers, this is probably pretty positive because it gives another option of a player who can compete effectively,” she said. ####  ##### SXC and Catalyst face competition from PBMs that are several times their size. Medco Health Solutions Inc. of Franklin Lakes, N.J., ranked No. 1 in the Business Insurance 2011 ranking of the 10 largest PBMs, with $66 billion in unbundled PBM revenues for 2010. ####  ##### Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS Caremark Corp. ranked No. 2 in the 2011 ranking, reporting $47.8 billion in unbundled PBM revenues in 2010. St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. was No. 3 with nearly $45 billion in unbundled PBM revenues. ####  ##### Citing Express Scripts' deal earlier this month to buy Medco for $29.1 billion, Ms. Motheral said consolidation in the PBM market is being driven largely by decreasing margins in the mail-order pharmacy business. ####  ##### During a conference call with analysts last week, SXC CEO Mark Thierer said SXC and Catalyst—which have specialized in mid-market clients—plan to compete directly against larger PBMs. ####  ##### “The combination brings together two highly complementary businesses, which collectively will have an increased scale and scope to better control drug costs and deliver customized solutions to payers, including employers, health plans and government clients,” said Mr. Thierer, who will remain CEO of the combined company whose stock will trade under the SXC symbol. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### While SXC and Catalyst separately are much smaller than the top PBMs, their combined strength could help them double in size during the next five years, said Brian Tanquilut, a Nashville-based health care services equity research analyst with Jefferies & Co. Inc. ####  ##### “This allows them to play offense and really try to go head-to-head with the larger PBMs to gain as much market share as possible,” Mr. Tanquilut said. ####  ##### Brooks O'Neil, Minneapolis-based senior research analyst with Dougherty & Co. L.L.C., said SXC is known for having a sophisticated information technology structure. That system, along with increased negotiation power, could make SXC-Catalyst a strong contender to the top PBMs, Mr. O'Neil said. ####  ##### “You need to be able to help your clients manage their pharmacy costs in the ways that are most comfortable for them and you need to be able to deliver exceptional quality of care to members,” Mr. O'Neil said. ####  ##### SXC and Catalyst may look to gain customers from Express Scripts and Medco as that merger shakes out, Mr. Tanquilut said. ####  ##### “There are lots of clients that are evaluating their relationship with Express Scripts right now, so there's a lot of opportunity for these guys to pick up...market share,” Mr. Tanquilut said. ####  ##### As the Express Scripts and SXC mergers move forward, the institute's Ms. Motheral said other PBMs likely will consider similar deals in order to stay competitive. ####  ##### “I suspect we'll see one (deal) every quarter for the next 18 months or so,” she said. #### "
"Q&A: James Klein, American Benefits Council";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management";" ##### Before its current term ends in June, the U.S. Supreme Court will hand down a ruling that will affect millions of U.S. residents: the legality of a portion of 2012 IRS rules that authorize federal health insurance premium subsidies to eligible lower-income individuals receiving coverage through the federal insurance exchange. James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington, which represents employers on a wide range of benefit issues, discussed the potential ramifications of the high court's upcoming ruling with Business Insurance Editor-at-Large Jerry Geisel. Edited excerpts follow. ####  ##### Q: If the court were to strike down the IRS rules, millions of people receiving subsidies would lose them. Would there be an impact on employers as well? ####  ##### A: The impact would be mixed. On the one hand, some employers who do not offer coverage or offer unaffordable coverage would avoid most or all (Affordable Care Act) penalties, since the penalties only apply when an employee goes into an exchange, is eligible for a subsidy and uses the subsidy to purchase coverage. Since the employees would not be eligible for a subsidy in certain exchanges, no penalty on the employer would accrue. ####  ##### On the other hand, for employers who may be looking long term to transition out of employer sponsorship, the viability of exchanges, or lack thereof, is a very important factor in that decision. ####  ##### Q: If the justices strike down the rules, is it likely the decision would be effective immediately? ####  ##### A: There were some clues during oral arguments that they would delay the effective date, recognizing the chaos that would ensue. ####  ##### If that decision is made by the court, they will find a way to defer the effective date, at least to next year. ####  ##### Q: If the rules were struck down, how would Congress respond? ####  ##### A: Republicans and Democrats have reasons to find a patch to enable the more than 7.5 million people who would lose subsidies to enable them to continue coverage. ####  ##### Ironically, a calamitous decision like that could lay the groundwork for a deal between Republicans and Democrats on making various changes to the ACA, including the continuation of some subsidies. ####  ##### Q: Alternatively, would you predict a rush by states to set up their own exchanges to ensure their eligible residents can continue to receive premium subsidies? ####  ##### A: Some of them would want to do that. It would be more difficult, though, to do that in some states, like Texas and Missouri, which have passed laws that explicitly prohibit their governors to work with the federal government to set up exchanges. I think, though, that some states and the Obama administration would try to be as flexible as possible, having states contract with the federal government to operate the exchange and deeming that to be a state-established exchange. We would see a variety of different responses from the different states. ####  ##### Q: If the court upholds the rule, could that decision lead to congressional agreements in other areas? ####  ##### A: The result would not be chaotic if the court upholds the subsidies. Neither, though, would we see the status quo. I think the Obama administration would react and say, “Look, twice there have been moves to invalidate the law, and they have failed.” ####  ##### Republicans will say, “We are very disappointed with this  outcome. We need to use every procedural tool at our disposal to repeal or make changes to the law.” Either result will result in some significant legislative activity. ####  ##### Q: And what is your prediction as to how the court will rule? ####  ##### A: I predict a 5-4 ruling upholding the subsidies, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing the decision. #### "
"Private health exchanges help introduce defined contribution approach";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### The rapid development of private health insurance exchanges over the past two years have helped implant the defined contribution approach in how employers offer coverage to their employees. ####  ##### The new approach is an alternative to the model used for decades where employers paid a certain percentage of group health care plan premiums, typically 60% to 80% but were largely unshielded from big cost increases in years when group health care premiums soared. ####  ##### With the advent of private health insurance exchanges, which Accenture P.L.C. projects will have 40 million people enrolled as of 2018, many employers have paired offering employees the ability to choose plans provided through exchanges with  another approach: paying a specific amount toward employees' health care premiums with workers paying the rest. ####  ##### “There is no question that private exchanges are a viable way to introduce a defined contribution approach” to health insurance coverage, said Randy Abbott, a senior consultant at Towers Watson & Co. in Boston. ####  ##### In addition, the employer premium often will be adjusted depending on the employee's choice of single or family coverage, while some employers tie their contribution to employee income. ####  ##### “In the private exchange environment, each employee is allocated a set amount of money to spend on the benefit plans that suit their individual and family needs,” said Steve Heckert, vice president of human resources in Clearwater, Florida, for GFI Software, which offers employees a choice of six plans through the Bright Choices exchange. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### That last feature has a special relevance to a health care reform law provision that imposes a penalty on employers if the premium employees have to pay for single coverage exceeds 9.5% of their wages. ####  ##### “The employer wants to make sure that employees won't bump against the 9.5% threshold,” said Sherri Bockhorst, a principal and national practice leader at Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s health exchange solutions division in St. Louis. ####  ##### Through the defined contribution approach, employers can budget spending on health care programs and be reasonably certain that budget will not be exceeded. ####  ##### “It comes down to meeting certain budget targets for their health care benefits programs,” said Eric Grossman, a senior partner and exchange business leader with Mercer L.L.C. in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### “Employers want their costs to be more predictable,” said Jim Winkler, Aon Hewitt's chief innovation officer for health and benefits in Norwalk, Connecticut. ####  ##### Such an approach also gives employers some flexibility, Mr. Grossman said. For example, employers may vary their premium contribution by employees' income and behavior, such as whether or not they smoke. ####  ##### The employer's approach also can provide a greater incentive for employees to choose a less costly health plan. For example, some employers design their programs so employees who do choose a less costly plan can apply the difference to pay for uncovered expenses, such as deductibles. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### There are some signs that the defined contribution approach, coupled with exchanges, are helping to hold down cost increases.   For example, an Aon Hewitt analysis found that health premiums for the three original employers in its exchange rose by an average of 5.1% in 2014 compared with  2013. ####  ##### That 5.1% increase is somewhat less than average cost increases of 6% to 7% that Aon Hewitt and others earlier had projected for the large employer market. ####  ##### Still, as plan costs rises, employers are likely to increase how much they pay toward employees' coverage, consultants say. ####  ##### Retiree health coverage, though, is another matter. ####  ##### Among employers that still offer such coverage, many have permanently set how much they will contribute toward retirees' health coverage. ####  ##### “Many employers have put in a cap” on retiree health coverage, said Aon Hewitt's Mr. Winkler. ####  ##### “The cap is a way of controlling the liabilities,” said Michael Thompson, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### When the cap is hit, private health insurance exchanges give retirees more options to which to apply the company's contribution, Mr. Winkler said. #### "
"Different variables affect limits on employees' 401(k) pretax contributions";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### How much in pretax contributions employees can make to their 401(k) plans is based on federal law and the design of the plan. ####  ##### Under federal law, the maximum pretax contribution employees generally can make to their 401(k) plan in 2014 is $17,500. ####  ##### In addition, the total contribution by the employee and employer is capped at $52,000 this year. ####  ##### Depending on certain variables, however, employees may be able to contribute more or less than $17,500. ####  ##### Under a Tax Code provision Congress made permanent in 2006, employees age 50 and older can make each year additional so-called catch-up contributions. The maximum catch-up contribution is $5,500 this year. ####  ##### However, highly compensated employees — those earning at least $115,000 this year — may be limited to less than the $17,500 maximum if their employer's 401(k) plan does not pass statutory nondiscrimination tests.  Under those tests, the average contributions of highly compensated employees cannot exceed the rate of rank-and-file employees by statutorily set amounts. ####  ##### Still, an employer can avoid the nondiscrimination testing if it adopts what is known as safe harbor 401(k) plan design. ####  ##### To qualify, for example, for one widely utilized safe harbor, an employer must match 100% of employees' deferrals up to the first 3% of pay and 50% of deferrals on the next 2% of pay. This option is the more popular, benefit consultants say. ####  ##### To qualify for another safe harbor, an employer must automatically contribute to employees' 401(k) accounts an amount equal to 3% of pay. #### "
"Employers boost 401(k) programs as pension plans get phased out";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### Employers are tweaking and sweetening their 401(k) plans as increasingly the programs become the sole retirement savings vehicle offered by many companies. ####  ##### Higher company matches and the introduction of automatic enrollment features have been implemented as employers seek to boost retirement savings plans while they phase out their defined benefit pension plans. ####  ##### While 401(k) plans once were viewed as arrangements to supplement corporate pension plans that provided a specific monthly benefit, unpredictable costs due to fluctuating investments and interest rates prompted employers to move away from those plans to the greater cost certainty of 401(k) and other defined contribution plans. ####  ##### As recently as 1998, 90% of Fortune 100 companies offered defined benefit plans to new salaried employees, according to Towers Watson & Co. By last year, though, just 30% of Fortune 100 companies still offered them (see chart below). ####  ##### The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s insurance program, to which employers with defined benefit plans must pay insurance premiums, covered more than 100,000 such plans in 1985. Today, it's just 22,000 plans. ####  ##### At the same time, the number of 401(k) plans has skyrocketed leaping from just over 200,000 in 1995 to more than 500,000 in 2011, according to a Labor Department report citing the most recent year definitive statistics are available. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### In response, many employers have beefed up their 401(k) plans to compensate in varying degrees for the loss of retirement income employees would have received from their now-frozen or terminated defined benefit plans. ####  ##### “Employers want to do what they can so that employees are saving enough,” said Rob Austin, director of retirement research in the Charlotte, North Carolina, office of Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### A major way employers have done that is sweetening the formula used to determine how much they will match employees' 401(k) contributions. ####  ##### For example, the most popular employer match now — used in 19% of plans — is one in which employers match 100% of employees' salary deferrals, up to the first 6% of pay.  By contrast, in 2001, the most common match — used in 21% of plans — was one in which employers matched 50% of salary deferrals, up to the first 6% of pay, according to Aon Hewitt data. ####  ##### Total contributions that can be made in a year depend on the employer's plan design and the employee's pay (see story at right). ####  ##### Some employers, especially those that have frozen their defined benefit plans, have done even more. For example, when IBM Corp. froze its defined benefit plans in 2008, it added an automatic employer contribution feature. ####  ##### Under that enhancement, participants in the cash balance pension plan that IBM froze received a dollar-for-dollar 401(k) plan match on employee contributions, up to the first 6% of pay, and an automatic company contribution equal to 2% of pay. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “When companies freeze their defined benefit plans, some may feel two steps are necessary” for their remaining 401(k) plan, said Jack Abraham, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Chicago, referring to a sweetened company match and an automatic employer contribution. ####  ##### Another design change that has taken hold is automatic enrollment — now offered by nearly 60% of employers with 401(k) plans vs. less than 20% in 2005, according to Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### That approach paid off for Hendrick Automotive Group in Charlotte, North Carolina. Employee participation in the company's 401(k) plan surged to 80% when the company added an automatic enrollment feature in 2011, up from 60% before automatic enrollment was added, said Andrea Darrow, manager of retirement programs. ####  ##### “We want to take care of our employees and be sure they have a nest egg to fall back on,” Ms. Darrow said. ####  ##### In fact, “automatic enrollment has been wildly successful” for employers, said Sandra Pappa, a Pittsburgh-based principal in Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s retirement practice. ####  ##### According to Aon Hewitt research, the average participation rate of employees subject to automatic enrollment is 84.6%, compared with just 62.4% for employees who are not. ####  ##### But not all design changes have been positively received. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### For example, AOL Inc. reversed course earlier this year following a barrage of employee complaints about the internet provider's decision to match employees' 401(k) contributions at the end of the year instead of each pay period. ####  ##### “We heard you on this topic. And as we discussed the matter over several days, with management and employees, we have decided to change the policy back to a per-pay-period matching contribution,” AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong told employees in an email. ####  ##### The motivation to reduce the frequency of matching contributions is simple: Employers can reduce their costs. ####  ##### “If you have a lot of turnover, you can save money and reward those who stay with the company,” said Robyn Credico, national director of defined contribution consulting at Towers Watson & Co. in Arlington, Virginia. ####  ##### Just 8% of employers that match employee contributions do so only once a year, with 86% matching contributions during each pay period, according to Aon Hewitt. #### "

"Meredith DeMartino helps make Event Network family friendly";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### When Meredith DeMartino entered the University of Albany in New York in the early 1990s as a marketing and finance major, she imagined that one day she would end up working on Wall Street. ####  ##### Instead, she began a career in human resources at Micro Interactive Inc., a multimedia startup firm in New York City, soon after graduating in 1995. ####  ##### “I was employee No. 15,” she said. “And they just started to grow, and I started to get involved with helping them with the growth from the talent acquisition, or recruiting, aspect. And then as we got larger, there was a need to really take on that HR role. I loved it so much, I ended up leaving that organization so I could go to a larger organization where I could truly learn the corporate HR function.” ####  ##### What Ms. DeMartino likes best about being in human resources is the fact that it also allows her to put what she calls her “numbers side” to use, especially when she is working on benefits programs. ####  ##### An opportunity to become compensation and benefits manager at Carlsbad, Calif.-based Dot Hill Systems Corp. brought her to the West Coast in 2001, and she went back to school at night, earning her master's degree in business administration at California State University San Marcos in 2003. ####  ##### She became attracted to Event Network Inc. in San Diego when efforts to meet up for a business dinner with President Larry Gilbert, one of the company's founders, didn't pan out. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “He suggested we meet for breakfast instead because he said he made a point of having dinner with his family every night at 5:30,” she said. ####  ##### Ms. DeMartino continues to espouse Event Network's family-friendly culture through the design and implementation of the company's benefits programs, including its on-site garden plots, its “family kitchens” and its regular support of community volunteer work. ####  ##### Family members also are encouraged to participate in Event Network's many wellness challenges and in annual enrollment meetings, which are held via conference call because most of the niche retailer's 1,250 employees work remotely in stores away from the company's San Diego headquarters. ####  ##### Further perpetuating the familial tone of the firm is the way cubicles and offices are labeled. Instead of traditional employee name plates, colorful plaques list biographical information that provides a glimpse into each resident's unique personality. Ms. DeMartino's plaque, for example, shows that she hails from Dix Hills, N.Y., and she has a 20-pound black-and-white cat named Roxy. ####  ##### She and her husband, Chris, a graphic designer who operates his own business out of their home in nearby Carlsbad, also have two young sons: Ryan, 6, and Brady, 3. #### "
"Event Network wellness program reduces 'health age'";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### While many employers are struggling with the effects of an aging workforce, Event Network Inc. has discovered the fountain of youth. ####  ##### By supporting a healthier lifestyle, Event Network's corporate wellness programs are helping to make its workforce physiologically younger by effectively reducing the “health age” of employees compared with their chronological ages. ####  ##### Though the average age of an Event Network employee is 38, employees' “health age” averages 36.6. ####  ##### The Health Age calculator that Event Network uses was developed by WellSource Inc., a health risk assessment and wellness program vendor in Clackamas, Ore. The calculator is based on the 1974 “Health and Ways of Living Study” that examined the health practices of 6,928 people in Alameda County, Calif., for 15 years and determined which were tied to longevity. The study found that people who followed all or nearly all of 10 good health habits identified by researchers lived an average of 12.5 years longer than those not following such a healthy lifestyle. ####  ##### The 10 key good health habits are: ####  ##### • Physical activity: Thirty minutes most days of the week reduces risk for many diseases. ####  ##### • Not smoking: Smoking can reduce life expectancy by up to eight years. ####  ##### • Body weight: People with a body mass index below 25 live longer. ####  ##### • Reduced red meat in the diet. ####  ##### • Eating three or more whole grain foods a day, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks. ####  ##### • Eating five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily. ####  ##### • Eating about an ounce of nuts daily, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks. ####  ##### • Maintaining a happy, hopeful outlook. Unhappiness erodes mental and physical health. ####  ##### • Having the social support of friends, family and groups. ####  ##### • Getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night. ####  ##### The health age is calculated based on proprietary scoring algorithms developed by WellSource that compare the results of the original study against the number of good health practices employees follow, using their collective responses to strategic questions in an annual online health risk assessment. #### "
"Clinton proposal would expand Medicare";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### A proposal by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to lower the Medicare eligibility age could be a mixed bag for employers. ####  ##### Under the 1965 federal law that created Medicare, the program that covers more than 55 million U.S. residents is limited to retirees who are at least age 65, with narrow exceptions. ####  ##### Earlier this month during a Virginia campaign stop, Ms. Clinton proposed reducing the Medicare eligibility age to 50 or 55. ####  ##### While Ms. Clinton suggested that younger retirees would have to “buy in” to the program to some extent, they “would be buying into such a big program that the costs would be more evenly distributed.” ####  ##### The Clinton campaign has not provided more information about the proposal. ####  ##### “We may not see a lot of details. Right now, this is campaign rhetoric,” said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. ####  ##### “Who will be on the hook for the cost? The devil will be in the details,” said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington. ####  ##### Ms. Clinton is not the first to propose lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Her husband and then-President Bill Clinton did so nearly twenty years ago. ####  ##### “What about all those people who retire at age 55 and lose their employer-based health insurance and can't draw Medicare until they're 65?” he asked during a speech to the Service Employees International Union in 1997. ####  ##### A year later, the Clinton administration formalized the proposal that would have allowed employees 55 and older who lost their jobs and exhausted COBRA coverage to purchase Medicare coverage for $400 per month until they turned 65. But Congress never acted on the plan. ####  ##### Benefit experts see pros and cons from an employer perspective in Ms. Clinton's proposal, which could affect 13 million people, according to an analysis last week by Washington-based consultant Avalere Health L.L.C. ####  ##### On the negative side, expanding Medicare to younger retirees could lead to more provider cost-shifting to those covered by employer plans. ####  ##### “Won't they jack up rates even more for those not on Medicare?” Mr. Gelfand asked. ####  ##### On the positive side, employers could partially offset early retirees' costs by contributing to health reimbursement arrangements to partially offset Medicare premiums. ####  ##### Indeed, some employers today make HRA contributions that Medicare-eligible retirees can tap to pay premiums for Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and Part D, which provides coverage for prescription drugs, said Sharon Cohen, a principal at Xerox HR Services in Washington. ####  ##### Others say the proposal's appeal would rest on a key detail Ms. Clinton has yet to provide: how much, if anything, the government would pay. ####  ##### “We don't know yet what it means to buy in. That has important implications for the government and for individuals,” said Kathryn Wilber, senior counsel of health policy at the American Benefits Council in Washington. ####  ##### Whether Congress would take up a lower Medicare-eligibility age proposal isn't known. Legislators, though, almost certainly would hold back if the cost weakened Medicare's financial health, Mr. Wojcik said. ####  ##### “This could accelerate the time table on when Medicare is projected to become insolvent, especially if there is adverse selection,” Mr. Wojick said. ####  ##### Last year, Medicare trustees projected the program will become insolvent by 2030. #### "
"Wearables for wellness fit right in";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, UnitedHealth Group, Health Care Costs, Technology";" ##### Many employers are embedding wearable fitness-tracking devices in workplace wellness programs. ####  ##### From simple step counters to sophisticated sensors that capture activity levels, heart rate and sleep patterns, wearables have become a popular tool to promote healthy lifestyles. ####  ##### Jessica Grossmeier, vice president of research at the Health Enhancement Research Organization in Edina, Minnesota, said employers that integrate wearables into robust, year-round wellness programs are seeing strong employee participation. ####  ##### “They're saying, ""Oh my goodness, this really gave our (wellness) program lift,'” said Ms. Grossmeier, who also is CEO of Verity Analytics. ####  ##### HERO's 2015 Wearables in Wellness survey found that 46% of employers offer some type of fitness tracker as part of a wellness program. Of those, half or more said they offer the devices to increase users' physical activity (94%) and healthy habits (62%), boost employee engagement (77%), and add fun and excitement to wellness initiatives (58%). ####  ##### Wearable device manufacturers such as Fitbit Inc. and Garmin Ltd. are part of the employer wellness space, but other players also are entering the market. ####  ##### In March, insurance giant UnitedHealthcare Inc. and technology partner Qualcomm Inc. unveiled UnitedHealthcare Motion, a wellness program built around custom-designed fitness trackers. Employees enrolled in the insurer's high-deductible health plans can earn up to $1,460 annual financial incentives for meeting daily walking goals as tracked by the device. The data is sent to an app via a platform that complies with federal patient privacy and security requirements. A smartphone app that syncs with the fitness tracker will allow iPhone and Android users to monitor their walking results and financial incentives. ####  ##### A spokesman for UnitedHealthcare said the program is available to businesses with 10 to 500 employees and that the insurer plans to expand it to larger employers later this year. ####  ##### Wellness programs are all about providing personalized support for employees and their families in their well-being journeys, and “wearables feed into that,” said LuAnn Heinen, vice president of workforce well-being, productivity and human capital at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. “They make health fun and social.” ####  ##### Some employers provide wearables free of charge. Others subsidize them or invite employees to bring their own fitness device. ####  ##### Atlanta's Emory University and Emory Healthcare hospital and clinic system piloted a Fitbit tracker at five sites in 2014 during an eight-week Move More Challenge. Employees received a basic version of the device for free with the option to “buy up” to a more sophisticated model, said Michael Staufacker, director of health management at Emory University. ####  ##### The test, however, found a big hole: 14% of employees who got the freebie never bothered to sync it to the manufacturer's website or mobile app. In contrast, just 4% of employees who upgraded never used the device. ####  ##### With the full rollout last year, Emory offered eligible employees a $30 subsidy to buy the Fitbit of his or her choice, with the employee paying the rest of the cost. ####  ##### “Having a little skin in the game ... seems to have an influence,” Mr. Staufacker said. ####  ##### Most employers hire an outside party to collect and manage personal health information generated by the wearable devices, experts say. The information provided to employers does not identify employees. ####  ##### But employers also must be aware of what information the devices collect, who has access to it and how it may be used, said Joseph Lazzarotti, a principal in the Morristown, New Jersey, office of Jackson Lewis P.C. and co-lead of the law firm's privacy, e-communication and data security practice. Without proper program designs and safeguards, employers could inadvertently breach various data protection and nondiscrimination laws, he said. ####  ##### “These (wellness) programs sit at the crossroads of a lot of different laws,” and wearables add another layer of potential risk, he said. ####  ##### Employers may tie biometric data from wearables to incentives in wellness programs, but the programs must comply with new  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rules that limit the incentives employees and spouses receive and ensure data is kept confidential, Mr. Lazzarotti said. ####  ##### Employers “still have to go through the hoops” to ensure that wellness programs comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, he said. ####  ##### Employers should also ask device manufacturers whether they have appropriate protections in place to ensure that the data is secure, he added. Fitbit Inc., for instance, announced last September that its corporate wellness offering complies with privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. ####  ##### Employers and wearable providers have another ongoing challenge: how to sustain employee interest when the novelty of logging daily steps wears off. ####  ##### “People engage with a device, and then they kind of hit a wall because they're not learning anything new,” said Rhett Woods, chief creative officer in the San Francisco office of Rally Health Inc., a digital health firm whose insurer clients run wellness programs for employers. ####  ##### Last September, Target Corp. doled out free and discounted Fitbits to its 335,000 U.S. employees and issued fitness team challenges. It put up $1 million to donate to the winning team's favorite charity as an incentive. ####  ##### Team-based challenges “create a lot more stickiness” because everyone's in it together, said Mr. Woods. “If there's no defined activity around the wearable device, then it's up to everybody to figure out how it fits into their life.” ####  ##### While some employees may be more engaged in minding their health, experts say it's too soon to say whether wearables improve wellness program outcomes. ####  ##### Emory, for one, is looking to future challenges. Under consideration: a $30 Fitbit subsidy for spouses or partners this year. ####  ##### For 2017, it is weighing credits to participants' health savings accounts, health plan deductibles or coinsurance, Mr. Staufacker said. #### "
"Employers look to wellness coaches to create, maintain healthy workforce";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aon Hewitt, Lockton, Health Care Costs";" ##### Employers are changing their views about health and lifestyle coaching as part of a wellness program. ####  ##### “We are seeing more employers step back and saying dollar-for-dollar (return-on-investment) is short-sighted and tough to measure,” said Dr. Ron Leopold, Atlanta-based chief medical officer at Lockton Cos. L.L.C. Companies are looking for “any combination of reduction in medical costs, short-term disability, workers comp claims and improvement in engagement, loyalty, performance (and) employee satisfaction.” ####  ##### About 70% of employers offered a wellness program in 2015, and 46% offered health and lifestyle coaching, according to the Society for Human Resource Management research. Such coaching can be used to help manage chronic diseases, weight- and stress-reduction efforts and smoking-cessation programs. While many employers initially focused on how wellness efforts affected the bottom line, more are focusing on the programs' ability to produce and retain a healthy workforce, experts say. ####  ##### “The reasons are much broader than they used to be; for one employer, it was all about productivity,” said Stephanie Pronk, Minneapolis-based senior vice president and leader of the health transformation team at Aon Hewitt. “With return on investment, (companies) could never get enough people involved to see a real trend.” ####  ##### Today's focus is on “value,” according to experts. ####  ##### For example, Children's Mercy Hospitals & Clinics, a Kansas City, Missouri-based hospital system with 7,800 employees at seven campuses and 10 outreach centers, measures the success of its health-coaching program by gauging the reduction of nine areas of risk, including weight, stress, blood pressure, cholesterol and tobacco use, said Candice Gwin, employee wellness program manager at the health care system. ####  ##### Children's Mercy Hospitals' health coaching efforts in 2015 reduced risks in seven of the nine areas and 16% overall, she said, adding that the reductions have continued. ####  ##### “The monetary aspect is important, but when you take a step back, we know that we can take better care of those kids if we take better care of our employees,” Ms. Gwin said. “We want to do this (for our employees) because it's the right thing to do.” ####  ##### “I think companies still want it to be quantified, but they are looking more at the value of health coaching,” said Kristin Behler, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based manager of health education and wellness at Populytics/BeneFIT Corporate Wellness, which offers wellness services. “Companies that buy into corporate wellness want to be seen as caring for their employees.” ####  ##### Another trend is that companies have shifted their focus from risk identification — such as annual health screenings — to risk reduction, which is where health coaching comes in, said Fiona Gathright, Bethesda, Maryland-based president and CEO of Wellness Corporate Solutions L.L.C. ####  ##### “The focus is on participants' goals and desires for changes,” she said. “Empowering employees to change their behaviors and lower their health risk is where the focus is.” ####  ##### “Health coaching continues to grow, (and) traditional telephonic health coaching is only one mode; we are seeing the use of technology, chat coaching, video coaching and, of course, in-person coaching,” said Ms. Pronk. ####  ##### Programs for every employer budget ####  ##### Companies with more resources tend to adopt more robust programs, with smaller companies turning more often to remote, telephonic and Internet-based programs that cost less but can produce some of the same results, she said. ####  ##### “The cost depends on the type of counseling; it can be minimal or a couple hundred dollars a year for each participant,” Ms. Pronk said. ####  ##### According to a 2015 analysis by Mercer L.L.C., at least 83% of large companies offer disease management coaching; 71% offer telephonic or Internet-based counseling; and 36 % offer face-to-face counseling. ####  ##### Still, Kristin Parker, Mercer's Norwalk, Connecticut-based principal and East market total health management leader, believes face-to-face counseling is on the rise. ####  ##### “There's a resurgence of on-site face-to-face coaching,” Ms. Parker said. “The trend is for employers to have on-site clinics in place and broader well-being centers with coaching available.” ####  ##### David Anderson, St. Paul, Minnesota-based chief health officer and co-founder of The Staywell Co., which provides health coaching services, said employers can still gain traction with more affordable telephone programs. ####  ##### “The downside of (the face-to-face) approach is ... in terms of the relationship and the participant, it takes a bit longer for the person to open up when they are in front of you,” Mr. Anderson said. “Anonymity over the phone allows them to get to you quickly, and the phone (call) is task-oriented.” ####  ##### When health coaching programs fail, anecdotal evidence points to timing as the reason why, Ms. Parker said. ####  ##### “This is when the intervention is not brought to the employee at the right time,” she said. ####  ##### Companies often adhere to strict enrollment periods for health coaching that coincide with health insurance open enrollment. The strategy, Ms. Parker and others said, often fails because a person could be diagnosed with a disease in the middle of the year and need the intervention then. ####  ##### The solution is to offer health coaching programs all year and to “flag” individuals based on health claims, Ms. Parker said. ####  ##### Dr. Leopold said mining health claim data and contacting employees who need intervention — often through a third party and with the employee's consent — is a delicate issue, but also is a hurdle companies can avoid by offering coaching to all employees. ####  ##### “Offer generally and then (send) supplemental information” to targeted individuals, Dr. Leopold said. “The industry is getting more sophisticated.” #### "
"Special trusts help employers shed retiree health care liabilities";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Special trusts called voluntary employees' beneficiary associations, long used to fund long-term disability and other employee benefits, have become a way for financially troubled employers to shed their retiree health care liabilities. ####  ##### VEBAs also are being used by financially healthy organizations. For example, more than 50 colleges and universities have banded together to fund their retiree health care programs (see related story). ####  ##### And in a one-of-a-kind approach, The Coca-Cola Co. has proposed using a VEBA as part of a complex arrangement to fund retiree health care using its South Carolina-domiciled captive insurer. ####  ##### The U.S. Department of Labor approved the arrangement in 2010. And this month, the Internal Revenue Service, in a general revenue ruling, gave favorable tax treatment to the approach. ####  ##### Coca-Cola said in a statement it is now studying the ruling “so that we can now move ahead.” ####  ##### VEBAs, first authorized by a 1928 federal law, have been around for decades. But it has been only in recent years — because of the size of the newest trusts — that VEBAs have been in the spotlight. ####  ##### “Until fairly recently, you haven't heard much about VEBAs,” said Michael Thompson, a principal with PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in New York. ####  ##### But that has changed. ####  ##### “There have been some very large undertakings,” said Dave Ostendorf, a senior consultant with Towers Watson & Co. in Milwaukee. ####  ##### “VEBAs are becoming an attractive retiree health care funding vehicle,” said Tom Tomczyk, a principal in the Pittsburgh office of Buck Consultants L.L.C. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Much of the recent VEBA activity has involved financially troubled employers that were liable for massive retiree health care obligations for union-represented employees and retirees. ####  ##### The largest retiree health care VEBA transaction goes back to 2007, when the three Detroit automakers reached a VEBA deal with the United Auto Workers union in which Chrysler L.L.C., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. agreed to contribute about $50 billion to a VEBA controlled by the UAW. With that, the automakers no longer have to provide health coverage to UAW-represented retirees, their families or future retirees. ####  ##### Also in 2007, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. agreed to pump $1 billion into a VEBA, eliminating its obligation to provide retiree health care benefits as part of a deal struck with the United Steel Workers union. ####  ##### The two are among the largest to date among the more than 1,000 VEBAs that have been formed (see chart). ####  ##### What these and other VEBA retiree health care deals have in common are trade-offs for employers, employees and retirees. ####  ##### For employers, the VEBA approach means relinquishing huge sums of money. For example, the UAW's contract required GM to pump $30 billion into the VEBA — money that could have been used for other corporate purposes. “You are talking about a very substantial cash commitment,” said Towers Watson's Mr. Ostendorf. ####  ##### On the other hand, employers' VEBA contributions, which include assumptions about interest income over time, may be far less than the benefits' value. In GM's case, its $30 billion VEBA contribution was $20 billion less than the $50 billion value of the benefits. ####  ##### Employers that use such approaches are free from the cost and administrative hassle in offering retiree health coverage to what can be huge numbers of retirees and their dependents. The auto industry VEBA, which provides coverage to 766,000 Chrysler, Ford and GM retirees and dependents, has 90 staffers, a UAW spokeswoman said. In 2012, the most recent information available, about $4.1 billion was paid for participants' health services, she said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### How long the money employers contribute to VEBAs will last is an unknown because of the lack of certainty on two key variables: investment returns and health care inflation rates. ####  ##### On the other hand, the VEBA approach assures retirees “that some benefits will be provided where otherwise retirees might have ended up with none,” said Buck Consultants' Mr. Tomczyk. ####  ##### From the retirees' perspective, “It is better to have something funded than not funded,” Mr. Ostendorf said. ####  ##### “The money is secure and dedicated to retirees' benefits. That has helped to bolster the security of the benefits,” Mr. Thompson said. ####  ##### More retiree health care VEBAs may be formed down the road. ####  ##### Mr. Ostendorf said he believes interest could come from the public sector, which has amassed enormous, and largely unfunded, retiree health care obligations. In 2010 — the last year for which complete information is available — states had $627 billion in unfunded retiree health care obligations, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Center on the States, a nonprofit organization in Washington. ####  ##### However, Congress' failure last year to extend a VEBA-related provision that was part of a 2009 law removed a tax break for special retiree health care VEBAs: those authorized by federal bankruptcy courts. ####  ##### Under that provision, VEBA participants were eligible for a federal tax credit equal to 72.5% of the premiums they paid for coverage. That tax credit, though, expired at the end of 2013, and little momentum has developed in Congress to restore it. #### "
"Maine health care captive insurer offers primary coverage to employer group";"Benefits Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Health Care Benefits";" ##### The nation's first group health insurance captive, formed as a result of special enabling legislation in Maine, is flourishing while controlling health care costs for its 50 employer members through value-based purchasing and an emphasis on wellness and disease prevention. ####  ##### While numerous group captives have been formed in various U.S. domiciles to provide stop-loss coverage to self-insured employers, the Maine Wellness Association Captive is the first of its kind formed to provide primary health care coverage to employer groups. ####  ##### Unlike a multiple employer welfare arrangement, which is governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Maine Wellness Association Captive is state-regulated. As such, it provides coverage for all state-mandated benefits, but also meets minimum essential benefit requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### “Although we're structured as a captive, we are following all the same guidelines as an insurer,” said Art Batson III, chief financial officers and owner of Falmouth, Maine-based John Lucas Tree Expert Co., one of the initial captive members, and chairman of its board of directors. “We're the only association captive in the country that is doing health. It's like a trust. It's just a different legal instrument. But to join the captive, you have to have Maine operations.” ####  ##### The health care captive was made possible as a result of a 2011 amendment to Maine's captive law that state lawmakers passed at the urging of employers, said Eric Cioppa, the state's superintendent of insurance. ####  ##### “The groups approached the legislature to change the statute,” Mr. Cioppa recalled. “We didn't have a lot of competition in the small-group market.” ####  ##### Because many of the health care captive's founding members had succeeded in lowering their workers compensation costs via self-insurance, they wanted to replicate that success in health care, Mr. Cioppa said. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We have one of the biggest self-insured workers compensation markets in the country,” with nearly half of Maine employers self-insuring their occupational exposures via multiemployer trusts, he said. ####  ##### Rather than forming a trust, the employers chose the captive route because it was not governed by ERISA and required lower startup costs, said those involved in the captive's formation. ####  ##### Since its Jan. 1, 2012, inception, the captive has grown to include 50 employer members, which collectively provide health coverage to 4,500 employees and their dependents, said Joe Edwards, a former Maine insurance regulator who was instrumental in getting the captive formed and now serves as its president. ####  ##### Captive executives say they are keeping cost increases at or below market levels. There are no initial capital requirements to join; employers pay a $100 annual membership fee to belong to the wellness association. Then, depending on their size, employers pay premiums for the captive's health insurance program, “MaineSense,” based on their group's claims experience or a community rate based on employee demographics. ####  ##### Employers determine their own plan's benefits and employee premium contributions. The captive picks up claim costs up to $500,000 per individual, with specific stop-loss coverage purchased from Pembroke, Bermuda-based PartnerRe Ltd. covering the rest, Mr. Edwards said. ####  ##### The captive has succeeded in limiting members' rate increases through value-based purchasing via direct contracts with health care providers and by emphasizing wellness and disease prevention, Mr. Edwards said. ####  ##### For example, the captive contracts with an imaging center normally closed on Saturdays to provide mammograms and colonoscopies to plan members at a fraction of what they would cost during the week, he said. ####  ##### “We also are bringing health care to the worksite,” Mr. Edwards said. “We had two guys who hadn't been to the doctor in 30 years. So we brought the doctor to them” by providing biometric screenings and worksite medical care. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### “We call it Triple Aim,” Mr. Edwards said. “The No. 1 priority is better health for employees. No. 2 is a better health care system. We think if we do those two things, there will be better costs,” the third prong of the plan. ####  ##### So far, the captive is achieving that goal, said Joel Allumbaugh, president of the Hallowell, Maine-based National Worksite Benefit Group, who has been a consultant to the captive since the startup. ####  ##### “It has performed equal to, if not a little bit better than, the market,” he said. Also, “with employer committees active in developing policy and changes to improve the program to suit the wants and needs of its members, it's also delivering a unique and beneficial experience” to captive members and their employees, he said. #### "
"Health care providers enter the insurance arena";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Aon Benfield, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers, Willis Towers Watson";" ##### The lines are blurring between traditional health insurers and providers as more health systems develop their own insurance plans. ####  ##### But, wary of this relatively immature health care delivery model and potential administrative headaches, most employers have been reluctant to choose the option. ####  ##### Health systems are moving into the insurance business from solely providing care through fully owned insurance plans or joint ventures with insurers to help promote high-value care, reduce costs, drive patients to their services and differentiate their revenue streams, observers say. ####  ##### Though the concept isn't new — the 1990s saw an uptick in the creation of provider-sponsored health plans, though many failed — it has seen renewed growth since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### Exchanges spur interest ####  ##### According to an April report by New York-based McKinsey & Co., 106 providers were offering at least one health plan in 2014, up from 94 in 2010, and about 15.3 million people were enrolled in a provider-sponsored health plan in 2014, versus 12.4 million 2010. Most of the growth occurred in government plans such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage and the individual insurance market, where there's opportunity because of the public health exchanges. The small-group market also saw slight growth, McKinsey said. ####  ##### Enrollment in the provider-sponsored health plans in the large group and administrative-services-only markets declined, however, McKinsey said. ####  ##### Most recently, Hartford, Connecticut-based health insurer Aetna Inc. in May announced a joint health plan with Texas Health Resources, a 24-hospital system based in Arlington, Texas. And in late April, a Wisconsin subsidiary of Anthem Inc. joined forces with Milwaukee-based health system Aurora Health Care to create a 50-50 joint venture, Wisconsin Collaborative Insurance Co. ####  ##### “The entire design of this is based on a mutual commitment to build a more sustainable health care system by, in essence, optimizing care delivery,” said Larry Schreiber, New York-based CEO of Wisconsin Collaborative Insurance. “We are acutely aligned on all the important metrics that we need to be holding ourselves accountable to” involving cost structure and clinical pathways, he said. ####  ##### Today's post-health care law environment, with its emphasis on driving value in health care, is ripe for health systems to take on more financial risk by insuring their own patients, observers say. ####  ##### But larger employer groups are a challenging market for provider-sponsored plans. ####  ##### Large employers have been approached, but “we see very few takers,” said Mike Taylor, Boston-based senior vice president with Aon Hewitt. ####  ##### There have been enrollment gains among small employers, as McKinsey noted, but they typically don't need a big national network. ####  ##### It's risky for employers, Mr. Taylor said, because most of the provider-sponsored plans aren't as mature as traditional health insurers. Additionally, it can be an administrative headache for an employer who has a workforce in several states, because provider-sponsored plans typically operate in the state or location where the health system is present, he said. ####  ##### “There's a little bit of a barrier to entry in that they're new, they don't cover enough geography, and I think that's what's sort of holding back employers from going to (them),” he said. ####  ##### Many local health systems don't have the “administrative infrastructure that's required to support an employer directly,” like the ability to coordinate with the employer's pharmacy benefit manager or deal with employees' health savings accounts, said Scott Rabin, Los Angeles-based national practice leader of health exchange solutions with Xerox HR Services. ####  ##### Providers “love this idea” of going direct, Mr. Rabin said, but some are “forgetting that there's a whole bunch of stuff that the health plan is doing for those large employers that are not necessarily about provision of care, but are absolutely essential to running a benefit plan.” ####  ##### Still, a few large, innovative employers are “piloting” deals with provider health plans, because “it could be better quality, better experience and lower cost, which is kind of the gold standard,” said Cameron Congdon, Boston-based North American health and benefits leader, client delivery and sales with Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. ####  ##### “Providers who have their own health plan have some unique and special advantages that most health plans don't have, because they have a local brand, because they know these people, they take care of them, they know where they live, they know their preferences, they know all the social determinants of health ... and as a result, they have some competitive advantages, where they can lower the cost and improve the a quality and make something much more affordable,” said Bill Copeland, Philadelphia-based leader of Deloitte L.L.P.'s U.S. life sciences and health care practice. ####  ##### For the model to be effective, employers evaluating provider-sponsored plans should ensure that the narrow network is “stratified” based on quality and outcomes and not just cutting out the most expensive providers to save costs, Mr. Rabin said. ####  ##### Wisconsin Collaborative Insurance is one of the few provider-sponsored plans focused only on middle-market and large employer groups. In the long term, the company could expand into individual and government plans. ####  ##### “What we're coming to market with is everything that you want from a local provider-sponsored health plan with everything you need from a national carrier,” Mr. Schreiber of Wisconsin Collaborative said. “It puts us in a space that differentiates us not just relative to local provider-owned health plans, but to our national carrier competition.” ####  ##### The joint venture eliminates the geography barrier for multisite employers by combining a local health system in Wisconsin with a national network. ####  ##### Provider-sponsored health plans could play a larger role in employer health plans in the future, experts say. ####  ##### “As these provider-sponsored health plans get bigger and more mature, I think there is likelihood to be more interest, because in general, they can ... price more competitively than some of the big carriers,” Aon Hewitt's Mr. Taylor said. “They can control what they charge for their services.” #### "

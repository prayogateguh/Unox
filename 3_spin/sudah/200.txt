"'Huge potential' for funding employee benefits risks through captives ";"Benefits Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Costs";" ##### BOCA RATON, Fla. — Only a sliver of the world's roughly 7,000 captive insurers fund their parents' employee benefit risks, but that number is likely to grow significantly as more employers become aware of the advantages. ####  ##### “There is a huge potential for growth,” said Lorraine Stack, a senior vice president with Marsh Captive Solutions in Dublin. ####  ##### Ms. Stack and other panelists who spoke Monday at a session at the 25th annual World Captive Forum in Boca Raton, Florida, detailed the most compelling advantage of the approach: cost savings. ####  ##### For certain lines of coverage, such as group-term life insurance and long-term disability, the cost savings — compared with buying the coverages in the traditional market — range from 15% to 25%, panelists said. ####  ##### “The captive earns the underwriting profit and investment income earned” on premiums paid to the captive, said Kathleen Waslov, a senior vice president with Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. in Boston. ####  ##### Another advantage to the approach — compared with buying coverage in the commercial market — is that the captive sponsor has greater control over the design of the benefits offered to employees, Ms. Waslov said. ####  ##### Still, shifting employee benefit programs to a corporate captive is not an approach that employers can implement overnight. ####  ##### The funding of certain benefit risks, including disability benefits, life insurance and health insurance, requires approval from the U.S. Department of Labor. ####  ##### If the captive sponsor can qualify for a regulatory review approach known as ExPro, the entire review and approval process can be completed in well under three months, captive experts say. To qualify for ExPro, though, an applicant has to cite two substantially similar individual exemptions approved in the past 10 years, or one similar exemption and one approved through ExPro within the past five years. ####  ##### Without ExPro, the review process can be two or three times longer. ####  ##### “You need to seek Labor Department approval. And that can be a fairly lengthy process,” said Debbie Liebeskind, a senior Willis Towers Watson actuarial consultant in Parsippany, New Jersey. ####  ##### In addition, Labor Department requirements — enhancing participants' benefits and using a commercial insurer to issue policies — that have to be met to win regulatory approval of captive benefits funding proposals are costs that need to be considered by employers thinking about using the approach, panelists noted. ####  ##### Another factor employers need to consider before moving ahead is the ability of corporate risk and employee benefits departments to work together. ####  ##### Shifting funding of corporate benefit programs to captives “takes a lot longer if the parties don't have strong relationships,” Ms. Liebeskind said. ####  ##### But even in situations when an employer decides, after review, not to shift funding of benefit plans through their captives, cost savings still are possible. ####  ##### Ms. Waslov cited a situation where an employer's long-term disability insurer lowered its rates after the employer told the insurer of its plan to fund the coverages through its captive. ####  ##### Employer consideration of the captive benefits funding approach enabled the company to gain more leverage with the insurer, Ms. Waslov said. #### "
"Boeing deal with professional union freezes pension fund at end of 2018 ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Boeing Co. engineers and technical workers represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace on Wednesday ratified a six-year contract agreement that freezes defined benefit accruals for members effective Dec. 31, 2018, while providing for special 401(k) contributions. ####  ##### The new contract agreement was ratified by a 71.1% vote of members of the union’s professional engineers unit and 73.2% vote of members of the technical unit of SPEEA, Local 2001 of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. The vast majority of the 14,100 professional engineer members of 6,000 technical worker members of the union work in the Puget Sound, Washington, area with the remaining members in California, Oregon, Utah and Florida, said Bill Dugovich, SPEEA communications director. The new contract takes effect retroactive to Feb. 11 through Oct. 6, 2022. ####  ##### SPEEA members accounted for 13% of Chicago-based Boeing’s total workforce of 161,400 as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s 10-K filing. ####  ##### The Boeing Co. Employee Retirement Plan was closed in 2012 to professional engineers represented by the union hired after March 1, 2013, and technical worker members hired after March 21, 2013, following separate agreements with professional engineers and technical workers based in Puget Sound, Wash., and other locations. ####  ##### The new contract provides for Boeing to make special contributions to the 401(k) plan for professional and technical union members moving from the defined benefit plan. Boeing will contribute 9% of a participants eligible pay in 2019, 8% in 2020 and 7% in 2021. Afterward, the company will contribute 3% to 5% based on age. ####  ##### For members hired after the March 2013 dates, Boeing will contribute 6% to 8% in each of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 3% to 5% afterward. ####  ##### Boeing and SPEEA on Jan. 13 reached a tentative agreement to replace the contract, which was to expire Oct. 6, 2016. ####  ##### Boeing had $56.5 billion in defined benefit assets as of Dec. 31 and $44.7 billion in defined contribution assets as of Sept. 30. ####  ##### A Boeing spokesman, said the new contract “is very much in line with our approach of reducing risk in the long term and shifting to defined contribution plans for our employees.” ####  ##### Barry B.

"Employers focus on physical, mental issues' effect on performance";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Disability";" ##### SAN FRANCISCO — Top U.S. employers are focusing on finding the value on investment of wellness and mental health programs, instead of focusing solely on affecting the bottom line of the company. ####  ##### Employers speaking Monday during a panel discussion at the Integrated Benefits Institute's Annual Forum in San Francisco said they are finding more success with wellness programs by connecting worker health to top-line business measures instead of focusing solely on health costs and other financial metrics. ####  ##### “We're trying to move away from health being a return on investment on a program,” Dr. Ben Hoffman, chief medical officer of global health services at Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co., said during the panel discussion. “We're looking at health as a value. And when you start thinking of health as a value, you start focusing less on quantifying things because frankly it's very difficult ... to quantify the impact of a lot of these programs.” ####  ##### “We want to make sure that we're tying everything back to the business because, ultimately, the only reason we're all there is to build tires,” said Dr. Brent Pawlecki, chief medical officer of Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. ####  ##### At American Express Co., for example, health care, pharmacy, disability, workers comp costs, as well as data from health risk assessments and biometric screenings, are integrated in a database, tracked and analyzed to “not only manage our costs” but to show which areas of the business performance are affected by workers' health issues, said Dr. Wayne Burton, global corporate medical director of New York-based American Express. ####  ##### “The point is to link the health of our employees in the U.S., but also outside the United States, to the productivity and the business needs,” Dr. Burton said. ####  ##### After initiating the database in 2011, American Express found that the mental health of the workers in its call centers was a driver “not of costs related to health care or pharmacy benefits, but a driver of disability … and also a driver of productivity,” Dr. Burton said. ####  ##### At its call centers, which are staffed predominantly by young women, the major mental health concerns included depression, anxiety disorders and stress, which weighed on the productivity and quality of the workers' customer service, Mr. Burton said. ####  ##### By linking workers' health risk assessments to customer service surveys, the firm found that customer service suffered as a result of the mental health issues among workers at the call centers. ####  ##### In response, American Express hired mental health counselors for its onsite clinics in the United States, expanded its employee assistance program and hired a psychologist to help direct its mental health initiatives, Dr. Burton said. ####  ##### “Healthier employers are able to provide better customer service,” he said. As workers' mental health improved, so did customer service quality at American Express. #### "
"Chevron 401(k) participants sue company over fund performance, high fees ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, Energy, General liability";" ##### Participants in Chevron Corp.'s 401(k) plan have sued the company and plan executives, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty for, among other things, paying “unreasonable investment management fees,” providing a money market fund instead of a stable value fund and offering underperforming mutual funds. ####  ##### The alleged breaches are in a lawsuit seeking class-action status, filed Feb. 17 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco against the company and members of the investment committee of the $19 billion Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan, San Ramon, Calif. ####  ##### “Chevron selected high-priced share classes of mutual funds, instead of identical lower-cost share classes of those same mutual funds, which were readily available to the plan,” said the complaint, filed by Jerome J. Schlichter, founding and managing partner of Schlichter, Bogard & Denton L.L.P. ####  ##### “Chevron also failed to adequately investigate and to offer non-mutual fund alternatives, such as collective trusts and separately managed accounts,” the complaint said. “Each mutual fund in the plan charged fees far in excess of the rates Chevron could have obtained for the plan by using these comparable products.” ####  ##### The complaint alleges the Chevron plan has offered a Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund as its sole capital preservation option since February 2010. Chevron “imprudently and disloyally … failed to provide a stable value fund as the plan investment option” in violation of the plan's investment policy statement to “provide a high degree of safety and capital preservation,” the complaint said. ####  ##### The complaint noted that Chevron replaced some mutual funds, switched some mutual funds to cheaper share classes and moved some investments to separate accounts or collective investment trusts from mutual funds during the past six years. The complaint argued that 401(k) plan executives should have acted sooner than they did. ####  ##### The participants argue the plan has paid “excessive” record-keeping fees to Vanguard Group in part because the record-keeping contract hasn't been subject to an RFP in six years. “A competitive bidding process … would have produced a reasonable record-keeping fee for the plan,” the complaint said. “Chevron failed to prudently monitor and control Vanguard's record-keeping compensation to ensure that only reasonable fees were paid for record keeping and administrative services.” ####  ##### Representatives from Chevron could not be immediately reached for comment. ####  ##### Robert Steyer writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"More insurers embracing telehealth";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama resisted paying for most telehealth services for years after their introduction. ####  ##### The insurer, which holds a near-monopoly of the state's commercial market, had cost concerns about the still-evolving technology that electronically connects patients with doctors and other clinicians. ####  ##### There wasn't even a clear definition of what qualified as a telehealth visit. Should doctors submit a telehealth claim for every patient phone call? Should real-time video visits be the primary catalysts for payment? Should telehealth be used mostly for primary care treatments such as ear infections and colds? Should it include more specialized care like psychiatry? ####  ##### “What is the definition of telemedicine?” asked Doug McIntyre, vice president of network operations at BCBS of Alabama. “People struggled to really tell us what that is.” ####  ##### But BCBS of Alabama, which operates in a mostly rural state where many people have trouble accessing care, recently shifted gears, in large part because of rapid advances in enabling telehealth technologies. ####  ##### As of last Dec. 1, the insurer began paying providers for five telemedicine services, including behavioral health and stroke. Amid rising demand, the insurer determined that the technology used to treat patients in those categories was “indistinguishable from a face-to-face visit,” Mr. McIntyre said. Earlier last year, BCBS of Alabama also struck a deal with Teladoc Inc. to add telehealth for urgent care to its group benefit plans. ####  ##### More private insurers are paying for telehealth services, a trend experts say will boost relatively low levels of utilization. More than half of states now have laws with rules addressing telehealth coverage. ####  ##### Nearly all payers now believe telehealth will help rural members access providers and may attract companies that want to offer modern conveniences to employees of the Netflix generation, who expect on-demand services. Insurers are also hoping telehealth will live up to its hype by keeping people out of more expensive health care settings. ####  ##### “They've begun to see the financial value in making these offerings available,” said Nate Lacktman, a health care lawyer at Foley & Lardner L.L.P. who specializes in telehealth matters. ####  ##### Looking ahead, telehealth advocates and providers see seniors on Medicare as the next major arena for growth. Roughly 1 in 5 people older than 65 live outside of a metropolitan area, and seniors usually have worse access to primary care physicians and specialists if they live in rural areas. Many older adults in urban and suburban areas also face difficulties traveling to their doctors' offices for frequent appointments. ####  ##### “When you're looking at the chronic condition situations, or simple rural situations (for telehealth), they're (equally) or more relevant to the older population,” said Patricia Smith, former CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. ####  ##### But Medicare still has restrictive rules for telehealth payment. Insurance, provider and technology trade groups are stepping up their lobbying efforts to pass legislation that will force Medicare to provide greater financial support for the service. ####  ##### The origins of telemedicine stretch back to the space race in the 1960s. NASA wanted to see how a zero-gravity environment affected astronauts' vital signs. NASA's desire to monitor the health of its faraway astronauts nurtured a curiosity in “Earth-bound physicians trying to diagnose or treat a patient in a remote location,” reads a 1996 essay in the Bulletin of the Medical Library Association. ####  ##### Today, telehealth includes everything from telephone consultations and live video feeds via Skype to digital CT scans and remote monitoring of intensive care units. Behavioral health, dermatology, radiology, infectious disease and stroke are commonly covered service lines, and primary care services are becoming a major focus, since they usually involve quicker diagnoses. ####  ##### But telehealth didn't have much of a track record. Teladoc, which has a member base of more than 12 million people, admitted as much when it went public in 2015: “The telehealth market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, consumer acceptance and market adoption,” the company stated. ####  ##### The big fear among payers is that telehealth will merely become an add-on to existing services — a reimbursed phone call or Skype chat that comes before or after the office visit. Medicare, in particular, has been “afraid it's going to blow the doors off spending,” said Jon Linkous, CEO of the American Telemedicine Association, a related trade group. ####  ##### However, the progression of higher-quality video equipment, smartphones and faster Internet connections is beginning to allay skeptics' cost concerns. Clearer, sharper telehealth interactions presumably will prevent patients from making duplicative in-person visits. ####  ##### As more people come to value telehealth, it's likely insurance purchasers will assume telehealth visits are covered by their plans. States are moving quickly to establish standards. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have private telehealth coverage laws, with eight of those states enacting new laws in 2015 alone. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates 32 states will have laws in effect by 2017. ####  ##### The statutes vary wildly, Mr. Lacktman said, but they broadly mandate commercial insurers to pay for telehealth services. Some stipulate coverage only for certain media, such as real-time video. Others require specific criteria only if payers choose to offer telehealth. Insurers in 23 states with stricter telehealth parity laws have to cover telehealth services at rates equivalent to in-person visits. ####  ##### Medicare, on the other hand, restricts telehealth payment to extremely narrow circumstances, reserving it as an outlet only for seniors who live in rural communities. For example, patients must live outside a metropolitan area, and they must be physically located at specific clinical sites when receiving telehealth. ####  ##### Medicaid's coverage is more in line with private payers since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gives wide latitude to the states. Coverage of live video telehealth services is almost universal. ####  ##### But the extent of coverage varies. California's Medicaid program, for instance, permits telehealth services to be provided to anyone in any setting, while Idaho Medicaid will pay only for telehealth if the patient is in a rural area with a shortage of providers. A majority of Medicaid programs do not have geographical restrictions, according to the Center for Connected Health Policy. ####  ##### Many large national carriers, including Aetna Inc., Anthem Inc. and UnitedHealthcare Inc., cover virtual physician visits in urban and suburban areas, as well as for their rural beneficiaries. In fact, most major commercial insurers and self-insured employers will include some kind of telehealth benefit. ####  ##### It's a centerpiece offering for some insurance startups like Oscar. Copays and deductibles usually apply, but total out-of-pocket costs usually don't exceed $50 for a basic visit. ####  ##### “With today's modern family and professional life and the practicalities of getting to the doctor, we need to offer the access and convenience of a virtual visit,” said Michael Radeschi, director of product management at Highmark Inc., a Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate based in Pittsburgh. ####  ##### He cautioned that the technology can't replace all the nuances of in-person clinical care, despite rhetoric from technology optimists who say medicine eventually will be able to be delivered through an iPad. “If we found ourselves at 40% to 50% of professional services that were telehealth, we'd be a little nervous,” Mr. Radeschi said. ####  ##### Most insurers use third-party companies to manage telehealth functions. Teladoc, Doctor on Demand Inc. and American Well Corp. are among the nascent field's leaders. Anthem created its own telehealth joint venture with American Well called LiveHealth Online. ####  ##### Despite a growing willingness to pay for telehealth, it still hasn't penetrated primary care in any significant way. Only 15% of 1,500 family physicians used telehealth in their practices, according to a survey last fall from the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies, the American Academy of Family Physicians and Anthem. ####  ##### More than half of the doctors surveyed said a lack of payment was the top barrier to using telehealth in their practices. Many physicians had no idea what Medicare, Medicaid or private insurers paid for telehealth services. “Insurers could do a better job of informing physicians of what their current reimbursement is,” said Miranda Moore, a health economist at the Robert Graham Center. ####  ##### Demand from health care consumers also remains meager, although it is growing. Demand was tepid after Highmark entered virtual medicine with Teladoc, so it expanded its service by adding Doctor on Demand and American Well to its networks. Those two vendors emphasize video visits, whereas Teladoc is more Web- and telephone-based. Not much has changed yet. ####  ##### “It creates a lot more buzz than it does use,” Mr. Radeschi said. Only 4% to 5% of Highmark's national commercial members have used telehealth services, and the usage rate in the insurer's Affordable Care Act exchange plans is below 2%. ####  ##### John Jesser, president of Anthem's LiveHealth Online, said his telehealth firm manages “thousands” of visits a year, but he declined to share specific figures. ####  ##### Anthem is pushing LiveHealth Online more — 15 million Anthem members across group, individual and Medicare Advantage plans now have access to it. But most people don't know it's part of their plan. ####  ##### “This is like the early days of Amazon when you were still able to buy books,” Mr. Jesser said. ####  ##### The limited uptake in the commercial market is still way ahead of Medicare, which almost always sets the bar for private insurance determinations. The American Telemedicine Association's Linkous called Medicare the “Luddite” of telehealth because of its strict limits on how, when and where it can be provided. ####  ##### “If you're a prisoner, a Medicaid recipient or an employee, you can get a telemedicine service,” Mr. Linkous said. “But if you're a Medicare recipient, you can't really, so it's a little crazy.” ####  ##### Medicare paid only $17.6 million in telemedicine services in 2015, practically a rounding error in the $634 billion program. The Congressional Budget Office has been highly skeptical of claims that telehealth coverage will reduce Medicare spending, and the budget scorekeeper recently said it doesn't have enough data to weigh in. ####  ##### Congress is taking up the issue. A bipartisan group of legislators introduced a bill this month, the CONNECT for Health Act, that would loosen some of Medicare's rules. Telehealth and remote patient monitoring would become standard for Medicare's alternative payment models and Medicare Advantage. ####  ##### The CMS has acted on a few fronts. For example, Medicare will waive some telehealth requirements for Next Generation accountable care organizations. Mr. Linkous expects there will be full Medicare coverage for telemedicine within the next decade because baby boomers and employees who have already used the services are “going to start demanding it.” ####  ##### Mr. McIntyre of BCBS of Alabama recently used Teladoc for what he called a persistent, annoying cough. An antibiotic didn't help, so the provider recommended during the five-minute call that he try an oral steroid. It worked for Mr. McIntyre, which saved him time and money. But he wonders how many people have that kind of seamless experience. ####  ##### “My fear is what percentage of those people has a Teladoc appointment and then is going back to the doctor anyway?” Mr. McIntyre said. It's that fear, however faint, that still lingers among many insurers as they expand payment for telehealth services. ####  ##### The flip side, advocates argue, is that telehealth will inevitably help patients, even if there is the occasional in-person follow-up. The modality allows physician groups to treat patients outside of traditional hours, and eliminates the costs associated with wasteful travel and wait times. ####  ##### Further, people living in remote regions can receive necessary care they otherwise might not have gotten. ####  ##### “Do we really want to ration care by inconvenience, or do we want to find ways to deliver valuable care as conveniently and inexpensively as possible?” Dr. David Asch, a professor of medicine and medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in an editorial last November for the Annals of Internal Medicine. ####  ##### And that's the rationale that has been winning over payers. “We're underserved in almost every county of the state in most specialties,” Mr. McIntyre said. “If this provides that opportunity for someone to get care they need, then it's a good thing.” ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Aon Hewitt private health insurance exchanges attract more employers";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Aon Hewitt";" ##### The number of employers participating in two Aon Hewitt private health insurance exchanges is continuing to increase. ####  ##### This year, 55 employers with more than 1 million employees and dependents are participating in the Aon Active Health Exchange, Aon Hewitt said Tuesday. That compares with 33 employers with 850,000 employees and dependents who offered coverage through the exchange in 2015. ####  ##### In addition, 75 employers with 400,000 covered lives are participating in an Aon Hewitt exchange for Medicare-eligible retirees this year, up from 50 employers and 350,000 covered lives in 2015. ####  ##### “Our exchange solutions are delivering on their promise of greater choice and competition through a retail marketplace that allows consumers to better match their true health needs and coverage, while helping the organization meet business objectives,” said Mike Christie, senior vice president and head of exchange market strategy at Aon Hewitt in Chicago. ####  ##### The exchange model typically deploys a defined contribution approach in which employers provide a fixed contribution and employees pay more or less for their share of the total premium depending on the level of coverage they choose. Through that approach, an employer can cap what it will pay for health plan coverage for its employees. ####  ##### At the same time, exchanges typically offer employees more health plan choices than their employers previously provided. #### "
"Employers try to cut pension costs by reducing plan size";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Financial Results, Health Care Costs";" ##### Escalating Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. insurance premiums are leading more employers to take steps to reduce the size of their pension plans, according to a new survey. ####  ##### When asked if they intended to change their pension plans due to legislation Congress passed last year sharply raising PBGC premiums over a three-year period, 32% of respondents said they are considering offering participants the option to convert their monthly annuity benefit to a cash lump sum, according to the survey released Tuesday by Boston-based investment consultant NEPC L.L.C. ####  ##### After taking a lump sum, affected individuals no longer are in the pension plan, reducing the so-called flat rate PBGC premium — the total amount based on number of plan participants — paid by employers. ####  ##### In addition, 17% of respondents said they are considering transferring pension benefit obligations to insurers through the purchase of group annuities. ####  ##### That approach also reduces the flat rate PBGC premium and, by reducing plan liabilities, also cuts backs an employer's exposure to the PBGC's variable rate premium, which is based on the amount of plan underfunding. ####  ##### On the other hand, 32% of respondents said that due to higher PBGC premiums, they are considering boosting contributions to their pension plans, reducing or even eliminating the PBGC variable premium they would have paid. ####  ##### Thirty-four percent of respondents, though, said they are not considering plan changes as a result of the higher PBGC premiums. ####  ##### The hike in PBGC premiums “has gotten the attention of plan sponsors,” said Brad Smith, a partner in NEPC's Atlanta office. ####  ##### Under the 2015 law, the current base $64 per participant premium will rise over a three-year period until it hits $80 in 2019, while the variable rate premium — now $30 per $1,000 of plan underfunding — will increase to $41 in 2019. ####  ##### Those rate hikes are supposed to generate an additional $4 billion in premium income for the PBGC through the end of 2025. ####  ##### But if the premium rate leads to more employers reducing the size of their pension plans, that increase in premium income could be much less than projected, Mr. Smith said ####  ##### The NEPC survey, conducted in mid-February is based on the responses of 41 employers, whose pension plans range in size from about $50 million in assets to $7.5 billion in assets, with a median size of about $400 million in plan assets. ####  ##### Responses add up to more than 100% because some respondents who said they were considering making changes selected more than one approach. #### "
"Group annuity sales for pension buyouts on the rise";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### U.S. group annuity risk transfer sales totaled $14.4 billion in 2015, up 54% from 2014, a LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute sales survey showed. ####  ##### Single-premium pension plan buyouts totaled $13.6 billion in 2015, up 61% from 2014, and accounted for 94% of total group annuity risk transfer sales in 2015. Buy-ins totaled $7.2 million in 2015, down 95% from 2014. ####  ##### In the fourth quarter alone, group annuity risk transfer transactions totaled $5.8 billion, down roughly 19% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Buyouts totaled $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up 70% from the third quarter. ####  ##### “In prior years, significant market growth was a result of one or two jumbo deals, like the deal between Prudential and General Motors in 2012,” said Michael Ericson, research analyst for LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute, in a news release. “This year we saw broad growth across the industry and many of the sales came from smaller plans. Companies reported selling more than 300 separate contracts under $100 million.” ####  ##### Among the buyouts announced in 2015 were Kimberly-Clark Corp., Dallas, which reduced its total liabilities by $2.5 billion with group annuity purchases from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Prudential; and Philips Electronics North America Corp., New York, which purchased group annuity contracts from Prudential, American United Life Insurance Co. and Banner Life Insurance Co. to cut pension obligations by about $1.1 billion. ####  ##### “With PBGC premium increases, market volatility and continued low interest rates, employers are becoming more interested in transferring their pension risk to an insurer … The institute expects this trend to accelerate in the next few years,” Mr. Ericson added. ####  ##### Meaghan Kilroy writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Senate Democrats urge revisiting multiemployer pension law";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee want Congress to take another look at a 2014 federal law that allows financially troubled multiemployer pension plans to cut participants' benefits after receiving regulatory permission, but the panel's Republican chairman is defending the law. ####  ##### Under that law, multiemployer plans, to prevent insolvency, can slash benefits. ####  ##### The driving forces behind the passage of the 2014 law were widespread predictions that the failure of massively underfunded plans would lead, in turn, to the collapse of the PBGC's insurance program. ####  ##### But in a letter released Tuesday, 12 Finance Committee Democrats said the multiemployer pension system “still is in crisis” and that new congressional action is necessary. ####  ##### Citing the PBGC's 2015 annual report, the Democrats' letter, sent to Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, noted that the PBGC's multiemployer pension insurance program has a $52.3 billion deficit and, even with the changes mandated  by the 2014 law, is projected to go broke in about a decade. ####  ##### “The only way to truly address this crisis is to do so on a bipartisan basis,” the letter said. “We need to make sure that we preserve pension benefits that people earned and are counting on to maintain their standard of living in retirement, while ensuring the solvency of the PBGC.” ####  ##### But Sen. Hatch, in a statement released Tuesday at the start of a Finance Committee hearing on the multiemployer pension problem, described the 2014 law as the best available legislative approach. ####  ##### Critics of the law “have to recognize that when dealing with the problem, there were only three choices: bad, worse and worst of all. In 2014, a bipartisan majority in Congress and the president went with bad.  No one is happy with that choice, I suspect, but it was the best option available to us at the time,” Sen. Hatch said. ####  ##### And to those who back a taxpayer-funded bailout of the PBGC's multiemployer insurance program, Sen. Hatch said the likelihood of Congress taking such action is low. ####  ##### “The idea of a PBGC bailout was proposed by unions, employers and multiemployer plans in 2010.  Back then, the House, Senate and White House were all controlled by Democrats, and the proposal got absolutely no traction. I have a hard time seeing how such a proposal could move forward in the current environment,” Sen. Hatch said. ####  ##### . #### "

The PBGC incurred a nearly $322 million loss when it took over the plan, which had more than 8,500 participants. #### "
"Student loan payback schemes attract millennial workers";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Voluntary Benefits";" ##### The small group of employers paying their employees' student loans continues to expand as mounting national student debt keeps workers from saving for retirement or reaching major life milestones, like buying a home. ####  ##### Fidelity Investments, the latest in a string of firms to announce an employee student loan payback program, this week said that 5,000 employees have signed up for the Boston-based financial services firm's student loan assistance program launched in January. ####  ##### New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.C. announced its student loan repayment benefit in September, and Boston-based Natixis Global Asset Management S.A. did so in December. ####  ##### The three financial services companies are a few of the only 3% of employers paying off their workers' student debt, according to the Society of Human Resource Management's most recent employee benefits survey. ####  ##### But some say the number may be set to grow. ####  ##### For one, Tim DeMello, founder and CEO of Boston-based startup Gradifi Inc., said the growth in the interest surrounding student loan repayment benefits is “sort of phenomenal.” ####  ##### “There is huge interest in this,” he said, adding that Gradifi, which helps employers make contributions toward workers' student loan debt, fields between 20 and 25 calls from interested employers each week. ####  ##### The company, which administers PwC's program, has about 100 employers signed up to launch a student loan repayment benefit this year, Mr. DeMello said. ####  ##### The employers Gradifi works with are a mix of sizes and industries, but usually employ a lot of millennial workers, Mr. DeMello said. “The human resources teams know that the workforce by 2020 will be 50% millennials, and they know (student loan debt) will be the No. 1 thing on their minds,” he said. These employers typically contribute about $100 a month toward eligible employees' student debt, he said. ####  ##### According to the Pew Research Center, millennials actually surpassed Generation X in 2015 to become the largest cohort in the U.S. workforce. ####  ##### “The employer gets the benefit of attracting and retaining the employee. So for instance, PwC — when they go out on college campuses they recruit 6,000 people. They are able to offer a program that is different than anybody else,” Mr. DeMello said. ####  ##### Outstanding debt for federal student loans currently stands at $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office. And about 70% of 2014 college graduates had student loan debt, with an average of $28,950 per borrower, according to the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success. ####  ##### Workers who are strapped with debt often have a difficult time saving for retirement in the company 401(k), sources have said. Others may delay major life milestones like buying a house or having a child, Jennifer Hanson, head of associate experience and benefits at Fidelity, said in a statement Tuesday. ####  ##### “As a financial services firm, this was really concerning to us, and we felt that providing a benefit like student loan repayment assistance helps us to address a very real financial concern that is impacting our employees directly,” she said. ####  ##### Fidelity's Step Ahead Student Loan assistance program provides employees who have been with the company for more than six months $2,000 per year toward their student loans. Eligible participants can receive up to $10,000, according to the company's statement. ####  ##### The benefit is paid monthly, and employees are not required to pay it back if they leave the company, Fidelity said. ####  ##### The firm partners with Santa Monica, California-based Tuition.io to deliver the benefit. ####  ##### “Never before has such a large percentage of the millennial workforce been burdened with levels of debt from their education that have a direct impact on their ability to pay their bills, save for retirement, and stay in the jobs they love,” Tuition.io CEO and founder Brendon McQueen said in an email. “Employers are recognizing that if they want to attract and retain the right talent, they need to start addressing a critical need that faces many of their employees.” ####  ##### Tuition.io works with fewer than 100 employers of different sizes, and employer contributions usually vary from $50 to $200 per month, Mr. McQueen said in the email. ####  ##### The growth at the company “has been incredible,” he said. ####  ##### “There is an inflection point wherein education costs have risen and incomes haven't kept up, which has created the perfect time to introduce a student loan contribution benefit,” he said. #### "
"Florida doctors push back on Aetna-Humana deal";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Insurers";" ##### Following Florida's February approval of the megamerger between Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc., three Florida physician groups on Monday called on the Florida attorney general to reject the merger. ####  ##### In a letter to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the American Medical Association, the Florida Medical Association and the Florida Osteopathic Medical Association said the reduced competition resulting from the merger would negatively affect health care access, quality and affordability in Florida, according to a statement released by the Chicago-based American Medical Association. ####  ##### The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in Tallahassee on Feb. 15 issued a consent order approving Aetna's proposed $37 billion acquisition of Humana on the condition that Aetna expand operations in underserved counties. The Office of Insurance Regulation had previously conducted a survey and found that there was no “strong evidence of an overall significant reduction in the competitive landscape of the private Florida health insurance markets resulting from this proposed merger,” according to the consent order. ####  ##### But the physicians groups say the office relied on “flawed arguments that regulation can substitute for competition,” according to the AMA statement. ####  ##### An AMA analysis released in September found that the proposed Aetna-Humana merger would conflict with federal antitrust guidelines in highly populated metropolitan areas across Florida. According to the AMA, 19 of Florida's metropolitan areas had two health insurers with at least a 50% share of the commercial health insurance market. ####  ##### “Competition, not consolidation, is the right prescription for Florida's health insurance markets,” AMA President-elect Dr. Andrew W. Gurman said in a statement announcing the letter. “Less competition in Florida's already consolidated health insurance markets will lead to price increases, not to greater efficiency or lower health care costs. Given the negative long-term consequences of the proposed merger, any remedy short of rejection would not adequately protect 2.4 million people in Florida,” he said, referring to the number of people covered by the four licensed Humana companies in the state. #### "
"Claims manager Crawford swings to loss ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Crawford & Co., Financial Results, Claims Management";" ##### Crawford & Co. on Thursday reported a net loss of $52 million during the fourth quarter of 2015 on expenses related to its GAB Robins Holdings U.K. Ltd. acquisition. ####  ##### That compares with the $3.7 million profit the Atlanta-based claims management provider reported in fourth quarter of 2014, Crawford said in a statement. ####  ##### The firm posted revenue of $300.5 million during the fourth quarter, a 1.7% decrease from the prior-year period. ####  ##### The company's workers compensation and liability TPA unit, Broadspire Services Inc., was a “bright spot” in the overall results as increased casualty claim referrals, market share gains and new products drove revenue and earnings growth, Crawford interim CEO Harsha V. Agadi said in the statement. ####  ##### Broadspire posted revenue before reimbursements of $75.4 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.1% from the same period in 2014. ####  ##### In a statement, Crawford said it incurred $17.3 million in restructuring costs during the quarter related to the implementation of Crawford's Global Businesses Center in Manila, Philippines, the GAB Robins acquisition, and restructuring of the firm's Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa/Asia Pacific business segments. ####  ##### Crawford also reported goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million during the quarter associated with the restructuring. ####  ##### “While our overall results are not yet where they need to be, I am very excited by the opportunities in front of us and am optimistic on the direction of our company as we work to improve our profitability and uncover opportunities to grow revenues,” Mr. Agadi said. “Our cost reduction plans are expected to enable our businesses to achieve their target operating margins in the current claim environment while providing significant leverage as volumes grow.” ####  ##### For full-year 2015, Crawford swung to a net loss of $45.6 million from a profit of $31.1 million in 2014. Revenue, however, increased 2.0% to $1.24 billion year over year. #### "
"Anthem suit over drug costs may start trend";"Benefits Management";"Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, General liability";" ##### Anthem Inc.'s lawsuit over pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.'s pricing practices sparks questions about transparency in the PBM industry and what the future may hold for stand-alone PBMs. ####  ##### Indianapolis-based Anthem last week filed a nearly $15 billion lawsuit against St. Louis-based Express Scripts alleging the nation's largest PBM breached its contract with the health insurer by charging higher-than-competitive prices for its services. ####  ##### According to the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Anthem also alleges Express Scripts breached its contract by not performing services in a “prudent and expert manner” and through system defects, inadequate training of workers and a lack of expertise. ####  ##### The suit is the culmination of a monthslong dispute in which Anthem claims it tried unsuccessfully to negotiate lower pricing. ####  ##### Anthem alleges that Express Scripts' pricing exceeds competitive benchmark pricing by more than $3 billion annually, or $13 billion for the rest of Anthem's 10-year contract with Express Scripts, plus $1.8 billion for the time it would take Anthem to ####  ##### transition PBM services once the contract ends in 2019, according to the lawsuit. The overpricing “has resulted in massive damages to Anthem and an obscene profit windfall to (Express Scripts),” Anthem alleges. ####  ##### Express Scripts, on the other hand, has “consistently acted in good faith and in accordance with the terms of its agreement with Anthem,” a spokesman said in an email. “We believe that Anthem's lawsuit is without merit.” ####  ##### PBMs help health insurers process claims, manage retail pharmacy networks and negotiate rebates with drugmakers. Many experts consider PBMs essential for health insurers to score the best prices for drugs. ####  ##### Analysts disagree on the outcome of the dispute. ####  ##### Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. senior research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said in a research note that he believes Anthem and Express Scripts will reach an agreement, as “Anthem's alternative PBM vendor choices are limited.” ####  ##### Meanwhile, Ana Gupte, New York-based managing director and senior research analyst at Leerink Partners L.L.C., said in a report that while “partial pricing relief” for Anthem is likely through the end of the contract, she expects the health insurer to look for another PBM partner beyond 2019. ####  ##### That partner could be OptumRx Inc., a unit of UnitedHealth Group Inc., she said. ####  ##### But losing Anthem could be costly for Express Scripts, said Randy Vogenberg, Greenville, South Carolina-based partner at Access Market Intelligence. ####  ##### “It's a lot of money, and Anthem's a big client for Express Scripts,” he said. ####  ##### According to Fitch Ratings Inc., Anthem accounted for 16.3% of Express Scripts' 2015 sales, or $16.6 billion. The suit also could prompt other Express Scripts clients to question if they're getting the best deal on PBM prices, sources said. ####  ##### “What's going to happen is you could see more of this kind of (legal) activity, where in the past they would just work it out because everybody was making money,” Mr. Vogenberg said. ####  ##### Now, rising health costs, thanks in part to costly specialty drugs, make it necessary to find savings anyway possible, he said. ####  ##### The fact that profits are getting squeezed also means there's a bigger spotlight on the lack of transparency in the PBM industry, Mr. Vogenberg said. ####  ##### The suit may be “the tipping point that will force transparency, certainly, but will also cause change in the way health plans and PBMs and probably (drug) manufacturers do business,” he said of a business that can be “convoluted.” ####  ##### “The lawsuit challenges a fundamental aspect of PBM-insurer relationships: the value of a PBM's negotiating power with pharmaceutical manufacturers,” Fitch said in its report. ####  ##### The increased scale that Anthem will derive from its proposed merger with rival health insurer Cigna Corp. could reduce PBMs' negotiating power relative to the scale of a combined Anthem and Cigna, Fitch said. If Anthem switches to another PBM, that could indicate a stand-alone PBM like Express Scripts isn't “best positioned to pass through cost savings to clients.” ####  ##### Other experts, however, see a future for stand-alone PBMs. ####  ##### “Most people in the industry will tell you that PBMs have staying power. Their clout and leverage will always make them a viable play for employers, regional health plans and even large multistate insurers,” Josh Golden, Atlanta-based practice leader of employer consulting at Pharmaceutical Strategies Group L.L.C., said in an email. ####  ##### Employers and other plan sponsors can learn lessons from the Anthem-Express Scripts dispute, said Craig Oberg, St. Paul, Minnesota-based managing consultant at PBM consultant The Burchfield Group Inc. ####  ##### “This should be an encouragement to all purchasers of PBM services that they should be cautious about long-term agreements and even renewing existing agreements without testing the market,” Mr. Oberg said. #### "

"Opposing sides in Supreme Court ACA contraception case suggest compromise ";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, General liability";" ##### The U.S. Supreme Court may be one step closer to reaching a compromise decision in a case brought by religious not-for-profits that object to helping their employees get contraception coverage as required by the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### The government and the petitioners agreed in briefs Tuesday that a new method could allow not-for-profits' employees to get contraception coverage without involving their employers. But the two sides still don't agree on all the particulars. ####  ##### The briefs were submitted in response to an unusual request from the justices last month to come up with ideas on the matter. ####  ##### The not-for-profits object to an Obama administration workaround that requires them to notify their insurers or the government if they don't want to comply with the contraceptive coverage mandate so other arrangements can be made for their employees. The not-for-profits say requiring them to provide such notification makes them complicit in helping employees get birth control, which violates their religious beliefs. ####  ##### The court's request for suggestions followed oral arguments last month in which the justices seemed divided on the case. If the justices were to split 4-4, the decisions of the lower courts would stand. Eight of nine federal appeals courts have sided with the government. ####  ##### Some experts have suggested that a compromise might be the only way to get a fifth vote at the Supreme Court. ####  ##### Debating alternatives ####  ##### The not-for-profits embraced the idea of an alternative to the workaround. ####  ##### “Yes, there are ways to do this without us,” said Mark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the petitioners in the matter. “If the government does this without us that would solve the religious liberty problem.” ####  ##### The groups suggested that the government could require insurance companies contracting with the religious not-for-profits to offer separate plans to the groups' employees that do include contraception coverage. Those plans could be individual or group and be sponsored by the government, they say. The insurers could contact the groups' employees directly to offer the coverage, keeping the not-for-profits, as organizations, out of it. ####  ##### The groups insist they were never trying to keep birth control out of their employees' hands. Rather, they just didn't want to be involved in helping their employees get such coverage. ####  ##### The groups' message to the government, Rienzi said, is, “You can do whatever you want, but you need to leave me out of it.” ####  ##### In its brief, the government also acknowledged — though less enthusiastically — that alternatives to the current workaround are possible. The government argued that the court should still rule in its favor, not requiring any changes to the current workaround, which it called a “minimally intrusive process that provides clarity.” ####  ##### Still, the government said, the process could change. Instead of requiring notification, the government could tell insurers to automatically offer contraception coverage whenever an employer chooses a plan that does not include such coverage for religious reasons. ####  ##### The court suggested the same strategy in its order last month for alternatives. ####  ##### Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia law professor, said in an e-mail the briefs show “grudging tendentious acceptance from both sides that the court's proposal could work for insured plans.” Mr. Laycock filed a brief in the case siding with the government on behalf of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. ####  ##### The two sides, however, disagree on whether alternative workarounds could be applied to self-insured organizations. ####  ##### The not-for-profits say individuals employed by such organizations that object to the mandate could get contraception coverage by enrolling in separate plans either directly through other insurers or the public insurance exchanges. The government could inform the not-for-profits' employees of the availability of such coverage, contacting them using information from IRS filings, for example. ####  ##### Or the government could require providers to tell the not-for-profit employees about their coverage options, the groups say. ####  ##### The government, meanwhile, says such an alternative would not work for self-insured plans. ####  ##### “This means the court will not be able to announce a solution that both sides will accept,” Mr. Laycock said. “It will actually have to decide the case.” ####  ##### Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois at Urbana, said the court seems to genuinely be searching for a compromise. ####  ##### “I think they're really trying to thread the needle down the middle and find a way for the religious objectors to be left off the hook without deeply upsetting the structure the government has come up with to accommodate those very same people,” Ms. Fretwell Wilson said. ####  ##### The sides are supposed to reply next week to the briefs filed Tuesday. A decision in the case may come as late as June. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Edison utility wins dismissal of lawsuit over 401(k) plan";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, Risk Management, Energy, General liability";" ##### (Reuters) — A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by Edison International employees in California who accused the utility of favoring higher-cost mutual funds over lower-cost ones in its retirement plan, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling backing the workers. ####  ##### The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said that while the Supreme Court in May 2015 ruled that federal law imposes an ongoing duty to monitor investments on fiduciaries like Edison, the workers failed to raise that argument in lower courts. ####  ##### The Supreme Court decision, which revived the Edison case and sent it back to the 9th Circuit, will likely make it easier for 401(k) plan participants to sue their employers for choosing investments that impose excessive fees, especially when those decisions were made years before lawsuits are filed. ####  ##### But the 9th Circuit on Wednesday said that before reaching the Supreme Court, Edison employees argued merely that changes to their plan triggered a duty to monitor, and not that the obligation was ongoing, so they could not make that claim now. ####  ##### The case concerned exactly when the role of a retirement plan administrator in monitoring a plan's performance can trigger liability under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. ####  ##### The plaintiffs and Edison agreed there was a duty to monitor, but disagreed over what that entailed. ####  ##### Employees filed suit against Edison subsidiary Southern California Edison Co., which said in a statement that Wednesday's ruling reflected the company's efforts to act in the best interests of 401(k) plan participants. ####  ##### Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### The employees argued the company breached its fiduciary duty by, among other things, offering higher-cost mutual funds to plan participants despite the fact that identical lower-cost funds were available. ####  ##### The main legal issue was whether some of the lawsuit's claims were barred by a six-year statute of limitations under ERISA. The Supreme Court said liability is triggered by the fiduciary's ongoing role monitoring the plan's performance, so the six-year clock routinely resets. ####  ##### In 2010, a federal judge in California said the claims against Edison were barred. The 9th Circuit agreed in a 2013 decision that the high court last year overturned. #### "
"Illinois pension funds to get $25 million from Goldman Sachs settlement ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, General liability";" ##### Illinois' pension funds will receive $25 million from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as part of a $5.06 billion national settlement over allegedly misrepresented mortgage-backed securities. ####  ##### Of the $25 million, roughly $23.8 million will go to the $42.3 billion Illinois Teachers' Retirement System, Springfield; $737,500 to the $14.6 billion Illinois State Board of Investment, Chicago, which oversees the State Employees' Retirement System, General Assembly Retirement System and Judges' Retirement System; and $472,500 to the $15.9 billion Illinois State Universities Retirement System, Champaign; Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan announced in a news release Monday. ####  ##### Illinois will also receive $16 million in consumer relief. ####  ##### Goldman Sachs announced the national settlement agreement Monday, resolving claims relating to its securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. ####  ##### As proposed in January, Goldman Sachs will pay a $2.39 billion civil penalty, make $875 million in cash payments and provide $1.8 billion in consumer relief. ####  ##### “We are pleased to put these legacy matters behind us.

"Cost of common health care procedures vary widely by locale";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### The cost of more than 200 health care procedures, such as knee replacements and pregnancy ultrasound tests, varies enormously by geography, according to a new study ####  ##### The study, published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found huge price differences from state to state, as well as among cities in the same state. ####  ##### For example, in Sacramento, California, the average cost of knee replacement surgery in 2015 was $57,504. By contrast, in Riverside, California, the average cost for the same procedure was $30,261, a more than $27,000 difference. ####  ##### Big cost differences also were found for much less costly procedures. For example, pregnancy ultrasounds tests were the highest in San Francisco, averaging $661 in 2015. The lowest average cost for the procedure was in Orlando, Florida: $180, or $481 less than in San Francisco. ####  ##### While some of the cost variations may be the result of differences in rent or wages, “the remaining variation is most likely due to differences in underlying market dynamics, such as varying market power, a lack of transparency, or the availability of alternative treatments,” according to the study. ####  ##### But the study authors said more research is necessary to identify forces that drive prices. ####  ##### The study was conducted by researchers at the Health Care Cost Institute in Washington and Stephen Parente, an associate dean and professor of finance at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. #### "
"Express Scripts CEO open to drug pricing talks with Anthem — within reason";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Express Scripts, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### The CEO of Express Scripts Holding Co. on Monday said he is “confident” in the company's lawsuit against insurer Anthem Inc., but remains “open to conversations” with Anthem to solve the dispute over drug pricing. ####  ##### “We want to make clear that we are confident that we have negotiated in good faith, are fulfilling our contractual obligations, (and) are providing excellent service to both Anthem and its members,” Express Scripts Chairman and CEO George Paz said during a conference call Monday with investment analysts. ####  ##### Last month, Indianapolis-based Anthem filed a nearly $15 billion lawsuit against St. Louis-based Express Scripts alleging the pharmacy benefit manager's pricing exceeds competitive benchmark pricing by more than $3 billion annually. But last week, Express Scripts fired back with a lawsuit of its own claiming that Anthem in fact “has failed to negotiate in good faith,” the lawsuit reads. ####  ##### Mr. Paz told investment analysts that Express Scripts' “legal case is strong” and the company intends to continue working with Anthem long-term, but the lawsuit will likely be “a long, drawn-out situation.” ####  ##### “We believe we are Anthem's best PBM option, delivering great care, keeping drug costs in check and helping to grow their business. We are currently collaborating with them to implement solutions, and we are proud of the results we are helping Anthem to achieve,” Mr. Paz said. ####  ##### “We have nothing but intention to continue to do a great job for them, to position ourselves well to be a choice that they want to make at some period of time in the future when we get this behind us,” Express Scripts President and Director Timothy Wentworth said during the conference call. ####  ##### “The reality is, at any point we're always open to conversations,” Mr. Paz said. “If (Anthem) want(s) to come in and have a conversation that's reasonable in nature — nothing to do with $3 billion, that's pretty ludicrous, you've heard me say that before — we're open to that.” #### "
"Health insurer execs reap massive rewards in deal-heavy 2015";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### UnitedHealth Group Inc. CEO Stephen Hemsley earned $14.5 million in 2015, according to a filing Friday, but he wasn't the top-earning health insurance executive. ####  ##### The highest-paid CEO in 2015 was Michael Neidorff of Centene Corp., a national Medicaid insurer. He earned $20.8 million. That does not include the millions of dollars worth of unvested or unsold Centene stock that Mr. Neidorff owns. ####  ##### Mr. Neidorff and the heads of several other publicly traded health insurers recorded larger cash bonuses and richer stock awards in 2015, a time that was defined by massive mega-mergers but also tumult in the Affordable Care Act's new insurance exchanges. ####  ##### The pay packages for CEOs of seven of the eight largest insurers went up from 2014 to 2015, according to a review of the companies' annual proxy statements. Together, the CEOs of the eight major insurance companies made approximately $112 million in salaries, stock awards and options, bonuses and other compensation. The higher pay reflected the companies' rising stock prices that were fueled partially by a rush of mergers and acquisitions. ####  ##### Centene completed its $6 billion deal for Health Net in March after a protracted review from California regulators. The acquisition opened up Centene to bigger plays in Medicare Advantage and the ACA exchanges, and it fortified the company's position as one of the largest, most powerful Medicaid insurers in the country. The company cited Mr. Neidorff's role in the Health Net deal, along with Centene's increased profitability, as the major reasons for his $3.6 million cash bonus. ####  ##### After Mr. Neidorff, Cigna Corp. CEO David Cordani was the next highest in compensation, followed closely by Aetna Inc. CEO Mark Bertolini. Mr. Cordani made a little more than $17.3 million, and Mr. Bertolini made just less than that total. Mr. Cordani agreed to sell Cigna to Anthem Inc. last summer in a deal valued at more than $54 billion, making it the largest in the history of health insurance. Mr. Bertolini orchestrated Aetna's $37 billion purchase of Medicare-dominant Humana Inc. right before the Anthem-Cigna deal. ####  ##### Mr. Cordani could make $82 million if he leaves Anthem within two years of the merger closing, although he made it clear last year that he wants to be Joseph Swedish's successor at Anthem. However, Anthem has not guaranteed Mr. Cordani the corner office when Mr. Swedish retires. Mr. Swedish made $13.6 million in 2015, and his pay didn't suffer even though he was in charge during the nation's largest health care data breach, which was brought to light in February 2015 and has resulted in several legal cases. ####  ##### Mr. Hemsley, the longtime CEO of UnitedHealth, was the only one of the eight top insurance executives who recorded lower pay in 2015, albeit his compensation was down just slightly. UnitedHealth's proxy filing shows that Mr. Hemsley asked the board's compensation committee to revise his bonus and total pay downward, “even though the board believes his performance has been outstanding.” ####  ##### Mr. Hemsley still holds an immensely valuable portion of UnitedHealth. He has more than 3.2 million outstanding shares of UnitedHealth's stock, which was worth about $430 million as of April 22. ####  ##### UnitedHealth was pummeled by the ACA's exchanges, announcing last week that it expected to lose more than $1 billion in 2015 and 2016 and therefore would pull out of most of the 34 states in which it sells ACA plans. But Mr. Hemsley and the company still closed several acquisitions of its own, including a $13 billion takeover of Catamaran Corp., which significantly grew UnitedHealth's Optum Inc. pharmacy division. ####  ##### Molina Healthcare CEO Dr. J.

"Coalition seeks prescription to cure rising drug prices ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### A coalition of health care providers, employers, health insurers and consumer groups on Monday proposed several policy changes aimed at tackling the rising cost of prescription drugs. ####  ##### The proposed reforms to the “broken prescription drug market” focus on increasing transparency, encouraging competition in the marketplace, and driving greater value for patients and payers, the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing said in a statement. ####  ##### The Washington-based coalition is a project of the nonprofit National Coalition on Health Care Action Fund. ####  ##### The proposals come as U.S. spending on health care hit $3.0 trillion in 2014, driven in part by exorbitant prescription drug costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Prescription drug spending grew 12.2% in 2014 to $297.7 billion due to costly specialty drugs, like those used to treat hepatitis C, and brand-name drug price increases, according to CMS. ####  ##### The coalition proposed requiring drugmakers to disclose a drug's unit price, the cost of a full course of treatment and a projection of federal spending on the drug. The coalition also suggested requiring drugmakers to release the true cost of research and development for a drug, as well as annually report increases in the drug's price. ####  ##### In recent months, drugmakers' pricing practices have gone under the microscope, touched off by last year's news that drugmaker Turing Pharmaceuticals raised a decades-old generic drug's price overnight to $750 a pill from $13.50. Since then, a national debate has surged over whether the expensive prices set by pharmaceutical companies are arbitrary or necessary for innovation. ####  ##### One way to bring down drug prices is to increase competition in the market, the campaign said. The coalition called for speeding up generic drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, noting that the FDA has a backlog of nearly 4,000 generic drug applications while securing approval can take three years. ####  ##### Incentives should also be used to drive competition for expensive drugs that have no alternatives, the coalition said. ####  ##### The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing also urged that exclusivity protections should only be used for new and innovative drugs. ####  ##### Finally, the coalition said policymakers should increase funding for research on drug pricing and value, expand value-based pricing in public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and require drugmakers to provide comparisons of costs and outcomes with other similar drugs so doctors and patients can choose their treatments wisely. ####  ##### “The drug companies must recognize that they are part of this larger health system and that their pricing decisions affect individuals, families, governments and purchasers. The specific policy proposals put forward by the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing are important first steps towards lowering prescription drug prices in the United States,” Bernard J. Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente, said in the coalition's statement. ####  ##### “Everyone in the industry needs to work toward solutions that help people get the medicine they need at a price that is affordable and sustainable,” Jim DuCharme, president and CEO of Prime Therapeutics, said in the statement. “As the only pharmacy benefit manager that's a member of (the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing), Prime is working with coalition members to drive more competition, transparency, and value as those strategies can close the big gaps in today's health care system that are fueling out-of-control drug prices.” #### "
"Ruling on cost-sharing subsidies could rattle insurers in midst of rate-setting";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, UnitedHealth Group, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Another bombshell could soon drop on the Affordable Care Act insurance exchange market, and it might come at a highly vulnerable moment for the health care reform law. ####  ##### Rosemary Collyer, U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia, is expected to soon issue her ruling in U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, a case in which House Republicans claim the Obama administration is illegally funding the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies without a congressional appropriation. ####  ##### If, as some legal observers believe is possible or even likely, the George W. Bush-nominated Judge Collyer decides against the administration, it would further rattle insurers who are facing multiple difficulties in the exchange business. UnitedHealth Group Inc. announced last week that it was pulling out of most exchanges because of its financial losses. Such a ruling would be a shock, even though it surely would be appealed, and the case could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### Legal briefs in the case were filed in January, and observers say the ruling is already overdue. ####  ##### “I suspect it would be a pretty big perceived risk, and (insurers') stocks would be negatively affected,” said Jeffrey Loo, a health care equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. ####  ##### If Judge Collyer — who previously startled experts by finding that the plaintiffs had standing to sue over a political dispute — rules that the funding of the subsidies is illegal, it would inject major uncertainty into the market just as insurers and their actuaries are calculating 2017 premiums for the individual and small-group markets. Insurers have to file their rates for plans sold on the federal insurance exchange by May 11. Most state rate-filing deadlines also are in May, including deadlines for big states such as California, Florida, New York and Texas, although some state deadlines fall in April or June. ####  ##### “It would create more volatility, and it would thin out the chances of (the exchange business) being a profitable program for insurers,” said David Axene, president of Axene Health Partners, a consulting and actuary firm. ####  ##### “I worry that (Collyer) will release her decision right as the plans are filing their 2017 rates and further upset an already worried market,” said Tim Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee University who supports the ACA. ####  ##### Judge Collyer increased speculation that she will find the subsidy funding illegal when she recently overruled the administration's assertion of federal oversight of MetLife Inc., blasting regulators for using a process she called “fatally flawed.” ####  ##### The MetLife ruling “indicates a lack of deference to the administration,” Mr. Jost said. ####  ##### Under the ACA, the federal government is projected to spend $175 billion over 10 years to reduce deductibles, co-pays and coinsurance costs for people with incomes under 250% of the poverty level who enroll in silver plans. The law states that health plans must reduce cost-sharing for those enrollees, and that HHS must pay plans for the value of the cost reductions. ####  ##### Nearly 60% of exchange plan members receive cost-sharing reductions through silver plans. Without the subsidies, the exchange plans' high deductibles and cost sharing would make health care unaffordable for many low-income people, and some likely would drop coverage. ####  ##### A January report by the Urban Institute projected that if the government is required to halt its payments to insurers for the cost-sharing reductions, insurers would boost their premiums for silver plans by an average of $1,040 and exchange enrollment would decrease by 1 million people. Depending on the timing, insurers “may leave the marketplaces in response to the continued litigation and associated policy changes, the lack of predictability such changes create, and the costs such changes impose on insurers,” the authors wrote. ####  ##### Mr. Axene said if the House v. Burwell ruling causes premiums to go up, some healthier people would drop coverage, while sicker people would find ways to keep their coverage, creating a more expensive enrolled population. ####  ##### A ruling that would block the federal subsidy payments would come on top of a number of other tough challenges insurers and the exchanges face in 2017, Mr. Axene said. Those include sicker-than-expected enrollees, rising prescription drug costs, the termination of the federal-reinsurance and risk-corridor programs that buffer plans against high-cost enrollees, and insurance industry concerns that the CMS' risk-adjustment program is hurting them more than it's helping. Mr. Axene predicted that combination of factors could cause insurers to seek premium increases of 15% or more. ####  ##### “Everyone is frantically running around trying to produce rates,” Mr. Axene said. “I'm not sure (the House v. Burwell case) is what people are really worried about. But it's another thing eroding the effectiveness of the program.” ####  ##### Harris Meyer writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Costco changes stance on pension; Teamsters recommend new contract";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits";" ##### (Reuters) — Teamsters unions representing 16,000 workers of Costco Wholesale Corp. on Tuesday recommended their members approve a new contract offer from the retailer that they said would secure larger pension contributions throughout an employee's career. ####  ##### The new offer came after the union members, which represent about 8% of the retailer's global workforce, rejected an earlier proposal that would not have extended coverage in the defined benefit pension plan to non-participating employees. ####  ##### The new agreement allows those employees — about 4,000 on the East Coast on a 401(k) plan — to join the other roughly 12,000 in California in their defined benefit plan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said on Tuesday. ####  ##### The breakthrough comes as a tight U.S. labor market prompts retailers to improve pay and benefits. Reuters reported on Monday that Target Corp. was lifting its minimum hourly pay by $1 to $10, its second hike in a year and following a similar bump by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ####  ##### Without disclosing details, the Teamsters said that language and economic changes allowed it to reverse position and recommend the offer. Ratification would conclude a 12-year push to make the pension change, the head negotiator said. ####  ##### The new plan “means more money being contributed especially throughout an employee's career,” Rome Aloise told Reuters. “The way the Costco plan works is the longer you are there the more you get, which is what they believe in: That you get rewarded for your longevity.” ####  ##### Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ####  ##### Costco has a reputation as a good employer with relatively high wages, standing out in a retail industry that faces criticism from labor activists for not paying workers enough to make ends meet. ####  ##### But Costco had characterized the initial, rejected proposal as its “last, best and final offer,” the union said last month. ####  ##### When asked why Costco changed its mind even though the new agreement could increase costs, Mr. Aloise said he believed the company came to understand how important the pension was to the workers. “Costco is a rare company,” he said. ####  ##### West Coast union members will likely vote on the contract in early May and East Coast members in June, Mr. Aloise said. ####  ##### In its latest annual report, Costco said it had 205,000 employees globally, all nonunion with the exception of those represented by the Teamsters. It said it considered its employee relations to be very good. #### "
"Treasury denies Central States' bid to cut pension benefits";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### In a major victory for multiemployer pension plan participants, the U.S. Treasury on Friday denied an application by the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund to slash benefits for hundreds of thousands of plan members. ####  ##### The move could spare 272,600 participants of the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund from proposed benefit reductions. ####  ##### “Today I notified the Central States Pension plan that its application to reduce pension benefits to hundreds of thousands of retirees was denied because the application that was submitted did not meet the requirements of federal law, the Kline-Miller statute, that governs Treasury's evaluation and analysis of all such private multiemployer pension plans,” Kenneth Feinberg, special master for the Treasury Department's implementation of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, said during a conference call with media on Friday. ####  ##### “We at Treasury have worked closely with the PGBC and the Department of Labor over the past many months to review the application in its entirety. It is unanimous that the application fails to meet the statutory prerequisites,” he said. ####  ##### In a statement Friday, the Central States Pension Fund said it is disappointed with Treasury's decision and will “carefully consider the most appropriate next steps.” Among them, the plan could reapply and propose larger cuts. ####  ##### “Although the decision by our trustees to file this application under provisions of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 was gut-wrenching, we are disappointed with Treasury's decision, as we believe the rescue plan provided the only realistic solution to avoiding insolvency,” the pension fund said. ####  ##### “While today's decision by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to deny Central States Pension Fund's rescue plan will temporarily spare many from cuts to their hard-earned benefits in the short-term, it also sentences participants to an insecure retirement where massive benefit cuts are inevitable,” Randy G. DeFrehn, Executive Director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, said in a statement Friday. ####  ##### The national Teamsters union applauded the decision. ####  ##### “On behalf of our union and the more than 400,000 retirees and participants in Central States Pension Fund, I would like to thank Mr. Feinberg and the Department of Treasury for denying these massive cuts that would destroy so many lives. We worked with thousands of retirees to educate Treasury and Congress on the devastating impact of the proposed cuts,” Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa said in a statement. “This decision means that there won't be any cuts to retirees' pensions this July or the foreseeable future. We will find a solution to this problem that will allow members and retirees to continue to retire with dignity.” ####  ##### The Central States' application was denied for three reasons, Mr. Feinberg said: It failed to show that the proposed benefit cuts would prevent the plan from becoming insolvent. It also failed to demonstrate that the reduction would be “equitably distributed among the retiree population,” Mr. Feinberg said. ####  ##### Finally, the notice sent to the pension plan participants announcing the proposed cuts was not “readily understandable,” but was instead “technical” and “overly complex,” Mr. Feinberg said. ####  ##### The Treasury on Friday sent letters to the Central States Pension Fund and members of the U.S. House of Representatives, announcing the decision. ####  ##### Mr. Feinberg also cautioned that the Treasury's decision pertains only to the Central States' application, and “is not to say that other private multiemployer plans that might be submitted to Treasury pursuant to this law will meet a similar result.” ####  ##### Five additional applications by other pension funds seeking to reduce benefits under the Kline-Miller law have been submitted, according to the Treasury's website. ####  ##### In September, the Central States Pension Fund filed the proposal with the Treasury Department to cut the benefits received by 272,600 of the plan's more than 400,000 participants. ####  ##### If approved, the cuts would have been allowed under a 2014 federal law meant to prevent the collapse of financially troubled plans and a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. insurance program that guarantees a portion of participants' promised but unfunded benefits. ####  ##### At the end of 2014, the Central States pension plan had $35 billion in liabilities and just $17.8 billion in assets. ####  ##### The Treasury Department had until May 7 to act on the Central States plan to cut benefits. #### "

"Kroger, UPS sue over Central States reduction plan ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Regulation, Retirement Benefits, General liability";" ##### A pending plan to cut benefits to members as part of a rescue plan for the Teamsters Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Rosemont, Illinois, is facing challenges even before the U.S. Treasury Department acts on the fund's application. ####  ##### Current and former plan participants of Kroger Co., Cincinnati, last week sued the $17.8 billion Teamsters Central States over the rescue plan. And United Parcel Service Inc., a former participating employer, challenged the legality of the rescue plan, which would enable the fund to reduce benefits, including those of current retirees. ####  ##### The Treasury Department is expected to rule early this month on the rescue plan. ####  ##### Current and former Kroger participants sued Central States April 25 because the participants want to leave the plan and start a new one before the Treasury Department acts on the pension fund's benefit reduction proposal. ####  ##### UPS, Atlanta, argued in an April 28 earnings presentation that the benefit reduction application by the Teamsters Central States is not legal. ####  ##### The Kroger case plaintiffs, current and retired warehouse workers for Kroger Co., filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Chicago, arguing that Central States trustees' refusing to consider an additional plan is a breach of fiduciary duty because it harms participants. ####  ##### The Teamsters union negotiated a proposal to remove Kroger participants from Central States and create a new plan for Kroger employees, with the company agreeing to absorb the increased withdrawal liability, according to the federal court complaint. ####  ##### Because Central States trustees “flatly refused to consider” after deliberating for just five days, the plaintiffs are asking the court to order reconsideration of the proposal, to appoint an independent fiduciary to judge the idea and to negotiate an arrangement with Kroger. ####  ##### If that doesn't happen before the existing proposal expires June 15, “the Kroger participants will be trapped in a plan that is about to cut their benefits and still faces likely insolvency,” the court complaint said. ####  ##### Thomas Nyhan, executive director and general counsel at the Central States pension fund, said in an e-mailed statement that the claims by Kroger and the Teamsters union “are without merit. As fiduciaries, Central States' trustees have a duty to safeguard the retirement benefits of all of our 407,000 participants — not a select few from a particular employer. Central States is prepared to defend against this complaint, and we are confident that Central States will prevail by demonstrating that the trustees' actions are consistent with their fiduciary duties.” ####  ##### UPS, which in 2007 withdrew from the Central States pension fund as part of a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, might be required to pay $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion in benefit payments if the pending benefit reduction application is approved by the Treasury Department. ####  ##### A “backstop agreement” in the 2007 bargaining agreement stated that in the event “at some point in the future if Central States ever lawfully cut benefits to that group, UPS would provide a supplemental retiree benefit” only to its participants, UPS spokesman Steve Gaut said in a telephone interview. ####  ##### The Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 requires the Treasury Department to approve an application if a pension fund's potential claims would cost the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. $1 billion or more. The Central States pension fund applied for the rescue plan in September with the Treasury Department. The pension fund is projected to become insolvent in 2025. ####  ##### The Treasury Department's decision is expected on or before May 7. ####  ##### Mr. Gaut said UPS also believes the benefit reductions laid out in the application are not legal. The MPRA imposed a tiered benefit reduction process specifically for the Central States plan. UPS argues that the benefit reduction application disproportionally affects participants in the third tier, which comprises the UPS participants. ####  ##### “The ordering rule that's laid out in the (act) would indicate that there should be a progressive reduction of benefits starting at Tier I, then moving to Tier II then moving to Tier III,” Mr. Gaut said. ####  ##### According to UPS, the average benefit reduction for Tier III participants is 53%, compared to 34% for Tier I participants and 29% for Tier II participants. ####  ##### According to a January paper from the Congressional Research Service, Tier I includes benefits for participants that worked for employers that withdrew from the Central States fund without making the payments required to fully exit the plan and Tier III consists of the benefits for the UPS participants. Tier II consists of participants not in either other group. There are 100,377 Tier I participants, 322,560 Tier II participants, and 48,249 Tier III participants. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford and Rob Kozlowski write for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"It's back to the drawing board for multiemployer pension reform";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The result of the first test of a new multiemployer pension reform law has left trustees of the Central States Teamsters pension fund reeling, other troubled multiemployer pension fund officials uncertain about their options, and some politicians feeling the pressure to step in. ####  ##### The U.S. Treasury Department on May 6 denied the benefit suspension application of the $17.8 billion Teamsters Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Rosemont, Illinois, citing three unmet criteria of the Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, which created the suspension process and put Treasury in charge. ####  ##### “If there's one good thing that has come out of this, it is that Congress now knows they have to go back and roll up their sleeves. It really is going to define this country,” said Teamsters International Vice President John Murphy in an interview. ####  ##### Treasury Special Master Kenneth Feinberg, in a press call, said, “We found there were fatal flaws in this submission.” ####  ##### Treasury officials found that the Teamsters' suspension plan did not distribute benefit cuts equitably and did not provide participants with easily understood notices — but above all, it would not avoid insolvency. ####  ##### The top reason for that, Mr. Feinberg said in a letter to the pension fund's board of trustees, were the actuarial assumptions used to support the pension fund's claim. The plan's 7.5% rate of investment return and entry age assumptions were too optimistic for a plan that at the time of its September 2015 application was 53% funded, with $35 billion in liabilities and likely insolvency by 2026, Mr. Feinberg said in the letter. For a plan in that shape, he wrote, using a common return assumption of 7.5% over a 50-year time horizon didn't fly because it failed to give enough weight to near-term expected rates of return that would have led to “materially different results,” or to negative cash flow problems likely to reduce asset levels even further, among other reasons. ####  ##### The demographic assumptions, Treasury officials said, should likewise have been refined to reflect the plan's cash flow and current data. ####  ##### That could have a chilling effect on other distressed plans considering MPRA. ####  ##### Scrutinizing assumptions ####  ##### Treasury's denial of the Central States application “does make clear that they are going to scrutinize the assumptions. That might change the ability for plans to make the case,” said Jean-Pierre Aubry, associate director of state and local research with the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, which identified 100 plans that could be eligible to apply for MPRA reductions, based on 2013 plan data. ####  ##### Central States Executive Director Thomas Nyhan defended the plan's calculations, which he said were “middle of the road and reasonable,” noting the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called them too optimistic, and a major employer, United Parcel Service Inc., Atlanta, called them too pessimistic. ####  ##### “Treasury is demanding a measure of actuarial precision that is not available,” Mr. Nyhan said in a press call following the application's denial, which he called “heart- and gut-wrenching.” ####  ##### As Central States trustees regroup to decide whether to appeal the decision or prepare a new application, the only certainty for plan participants at this point is the money for benefits will run out by 2026 at the latest, he said. ####  ##### “We hope the people who urged rejection will come forward now and seek solutions,” said Mr. Nyhan, who puts members of Congress at the top of that list. “Now is the moment for them to step to the plate and provide the funds. The time for rhetoric has passed; the moment for action is now.” ####  ##### Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew echoed that call in a letter announcing the decision to leaders of the Senate Finance and Health Education Labor and Pension committees. Since Central States filed the first MPRA application, “many stakeholders, including members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, have recognized the harshness of the cuts needed,” Mr. Lew said, but the law does not allow Treasury to consider alternatives. ####  ##### With the ball now back in Congress' court, “finding a balanced solution will require painful choices,” said Mr. Lew. ####  ##### “There's a lesson for Congress here,” agreed Mr. Murphy of the Teamsters. “I know there is a recognition by a lot of members of Congress that the multiemployer pension system is in very serious trouble and there has to be some kind of solution that does not include reducing the income of senior citizens. If we can keep this issue on the front burner ... I think we can come up with some creative solutions. ####  ##### “For this problem to be solved, we have to come up with a new source of funding for financially stressed pension funds,” said Mr. Murphy, who predicted some ideas will come forth in the next few months. ####  ##### Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a critic of the MPRA, said in a statement supporting the decision by the Treasury that “there are no easy answers here, and Congress needs to work harder on a bipartisan basis to develop other solutions.” ####  ##### MPRA's co-author, House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minn., who is retiring this year, has pledged to continue working on legislation to strengthen the multiemployer system. Randy DeFrehn, executive director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, Washington, whose multiemployer pension reform ideas led to passage of the MPRA, supports the application process as a way to avoid deeper cuts in the long run for plans without options. ####  ##### Not betting on Congress ####  ##### Mr. DeFrehn is not betting on Congress right away. “Congress has had many opportunities to provide assistance (but) they have chosen not to do so and it is unlikely they will,” he said in an email. He is more optimistic about legislation now before Mr. Kline's committee that would revisit withdrawal liability and allow for composite plans with both defined benefit and defined contribution features, which he said has broad bipartisan support. ####  ##### “Chairman Kline has said that passing this is his top legislative priority. So barring any unforeseen legislative event, this may be one of the few pieces of legislation that can be passed this year,” Mr. DeFrehn said. “We hope that some way can be found to support the multiemployer defined benefit system and those who, through no fault of their own, now face a much less secure retirement than they had been promised.” ####  ##### Sweeping solutions are not expected in an election year, particularly one that could change the balance of power in Congress. MPRA critics, including the Pension Rights Center in Washington and AARP, realize their victory in the Central States decision is short-lived, as many troubled multiemployer plans head toward insolvency, along with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s multiemployer insurance program itself. ####  ##### Four other plans — the $92 million Iron Workers Local 17 Pension Fund, Cleveland; the $123 million Teamsters Local 469 Pension Plan, Hazlet, New Jersey; the $86 million Iron Workers Local Union 16, Towson, Maryland; and the $27.8 million Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, Hempstead, New York — also have filed for benefit suspensions. The Pension Rights Center identified 52 multiemployer plans that have notified the U.S. Department of Labor of their “critical and declining” status, which allows them to consider applying for MPRA relief. ####  ##### “It's not a rosy picture at all,” said Mr. Aubry with the Center for Retirement Research, who noted the funding deficits in multiemployer plans are collectively smaller than for public-sector plans, which are short by an estimated $1 trillion, and in the private sector. ####  ##### If the MPRA is not an option and Congress doesn't find the political will and significant sources of money to rescue ailing multiemployer plans or the PBGC, it will be up to pension fund trustees to figure out which painful steps to take, he said. “That's the conversation that has to be had now. It's a difficult conversation to have.” ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Justice Department will appeal decision in Affordable Care Act case ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Political Risk, General liability, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### The Department of Justice will appeal a judge's ruling that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally funding part of the Affordable Care Act, a department spokesman confirmed Friday. ####  ##### The announcement was expected. It follows a federal judge's decision Thursday to side with House Republicans in their lawsuit against the administration. ####  ##### House Republicans alleged in that lawsuit that the administration illegally spent money that Congress never appropriated for the ACA's cost-sharing provisions. Those provisions include reduced deductibles, copayments and coinsurance many Americans receive, depending on income, for plans purchased through the ACA's insurance exchanges. ####  ##### About 56% of Americans who receive coverage through ACA's insurance exchanges — about 5.6 million people — got cost-sharing reductions as of June 2015, according to the CMS. ####  ##### U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who made the decision, stayed her ruling pending an appeal, so her decision won't go into effect as long as the matter is on appeal. ####  ##### That means the decision won't likely affect insurance rate-setting or participation for 2017, though it does create some uncertainty in the long run for insurers. Shares for four of the nation's major insurers and a number of large hospital chains all dropped Thursday. ####  ##### If the ruling were to be upheld by the appeals court and/or the U.S. Supreme Court, it might lead insurers to raise their premiums to compensate for the lost money. That, in turn, would likely trigger an increase in tax credits the government now allows Americans to help them afford their premiums. ####  ##### Another possibility if Congress refused to appropriate the money is that insurers would seek relief in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Yet another possible outcome is that Congress would start appropriating the money each year. That, however, could complicate insurers' annual rate-setting process because they often have to set rates before the appropriations process concludes, said Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. ####  ##### Legal experts agree that the appeals court will likely closely examine the issue of whether House Republicans even have standing to sue the administration. Judge Collyer surprised many last year when she ruled that House Republicans did have standing to sue. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Tennessee Valley Authority OKs partial freeze of cash balance plan ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The board of the Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement System, Knoxville, approved a compromise proposal from the TVA staff and its board of directors that would partially freeze its cash balance pension fund and move some current employees to the 401(k) plan effective Oct. 1, a TVA spokesman said. ####  ##### The TVA board of directors had issued the compromise proposal April 18 in response to a retirement system board counterproposal March 3 that altered an original December proposal to freeze the plan and move all participants to the 401(k) plan. The TVARS board’s March 3 counterproposal moves only participants with less than 10 years of service to the existing 401(k) plan. TVA would contribute 6% of an employee’s salary and then match 100% of employee contributions up to 6% of salary. ####  ##### The April 18 compromise proposal approved by the retirement system board Monday adopts those tenets of the counterproposal and also includes minor changes that do not alter basic components of the counterproposal. The board will now draw up the language of amendments to retirement system’s rules, which are scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1, and submit them to the TVA board of directors. ####  ##### The changes will take effect unless the board of directors vetoes them within 30 days of the receipt of the amendments. ####  ##### The cash balance pension plan was established for employees hired on or after Jan. 1, 1996, and closed to new hires on July 1, 2014. The original staff proposal in December froze the plan and moved all participants to the 401(k) plan. ####  ##### Those with 10 years or more of service would receive 3% of pay credits on future earnings to their cash balance accounts; they currently receive 6%. The participants would then receive a 3% automatic contribution to their 401(k) accounts in addition to the current employer match of 75% of employee contributions up to 6% of pay. Thus, the potential TVA contribution to their 401(k) accounts would rise to 7.5% from 4.5%. ####  ##### TVA will contribute the greater of $300 million per year or the minimum required contribution over the next 20 years to the cash balance plan or until it’s fully funded. ####  ##### As of Sept. 30, pension fund assets totaled $6.8 billion, and projected benefit obligations totaled $12.8 billion, for a funding ratio of 53.1%, according to TVA’s most recent 10-K filing. The 401(k) plan has $1.9 billion in assets. ####  ##### Rob Kozlowski writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "

"Hospital agrees to funnel millions into pension plan to settle litigation";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Another hospital has agreed to settle for $107 million in what's become a growing list of cases over whether faith-based health systems have to follow federal rules meant to protect employee pensions. ####  ##### Carol Kemp-DeLisser, the pension participant who filed the class-action case, alleged that St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, owned by Trinity Health Corp., wrongly classified its pension plan as a ""church plan."" Church plans are not subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which protects employees by requiring that pension plans be insured and sufficiently funded. Kemp-DeLisser alleged that St. Francis failed to adhere to ERISAs minimum finding standards. ####  ##### St. Francis, however, argued that because it is associated with and controlled by the Catholic Church, its pension plan is a church plan, exempt from ERISA. ####  ##### As part of the settlement, the Hartford, Conn., hospital has agreed to pour another $17 million into its employee pension following settlement approval. It will then contribute another $10 million a year for nine years. St. Francis denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement and maintains that its pension plan is a church plan exempt from ERISA. ####  ##### St. Francis said in a statement that it, “remains committed to ensuring our retirees and their beneficiaries receive their benefits under all of our retirement plans.” It noted that its plan remains a church plan. ####  ##### “As intended, the plan has paid benefits in full to our retirees and will continue to do so into the future,” the hospital said in the statement. “The lawsuit was resolved by committing to fund the plan in a manner consistent with what St. Francis has done in the past and intends to do in the future.” ####  ##### St. Francis also noted in court documents that part of the rationale for exempting church-affiliated plans from ERISA was to separate church and state. ####  ##### The case is one of many similar across the country. As of March, about a dozen such cases had been filed and more are expected. ####  ##### Ascension Health settled after a district court judge sided with the health system, finding that “a plan need not be established by a church in order to qualify as a church plan.” ####  ##### And at least two federal appeals courts have weighed in on the issue. In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit ruled that Advocate Health Care's pension plan is not a church plan simply because the health system is religiously affiliated. In December, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against St. Peter's Healthcare System in New Jersey. ####  ##### District courts have been somewhat divided on the issue. For example, a district court judge recently partially granted a motion to dismiss a case filed against Trinity Health, saying an organization “controlled by or associated with a church or a convention of churches” is permitted to establish a church plan. ####  ##### Some experts have speculated that the issue may eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### Lisa Schencker writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Disputes at top put Anthem-Cigna merger in doubt";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Cigna, Mergers & Acquisitions, E&O";" ##### Bickering between Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. executives signals that the health insurers' planned merger is looking less likely. ####  ##### Private letters between the insurers' executives obtained by the Wall Street Journal show several disagreements in their pending $54 billion merger. ####  ##### “The lack of progress and the issues that we see come to surface do put less of a probability in place as far as getting the deal done,” Vishnu Lekraj, senior equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said Tuesday. ####  ##### The discord “obviously makes it more difficult,” said Stephen Zaharuk, New York-based senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc. “When you combine two cultures, you need a lot of cooperation.” ####  ##### According to the Journal report, leaders of both insurers have been bickering about missing deadlines to submit data to antitrust regulators, violating their merger agreement, and falling behind the merger of rivals Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. in the regulatory approval process. ####  ##### Cigna is wary of Anthem's March lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., which Cigna Chairman Isaiah Harris Jr. said in an April 9 letter could hurt the merger's chances of winning regulatory approval, the newspaper reported. ####  ##### Other issues ####  ##### Other signs also point to a growing disconnect between the insurers. ####  ##### Cigna earlier this month said in a regulatory filing that the merger may not close in the second half of 2016. But Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish said at the UBS Global Healthcare Conference on Tuesday that the insurer expects to hear a decision from antitrust regulators in July, Reuters reported. ####  ##### Cigna and Anthem representatives declined to comment on the letters. A Cigna spokesman also declined comment on the merger timeline, while an Anthem spokeswoman reiterated that the deal is expected to close in the second half of this year. ####  ##### “Since the deal was initially struck, there have been issues of culture clash, especially among management teams as far as who is going to run what part of the business and who is going to be in charge, and which firm is going to take over for the most part moving forward,” Mr. Lekraj said. ####  ##### Anthem proposed acquiring Cigna in June 2015, but it took several rounds before a deal was struck in late July. One sticking point was who would lead the company. Cigna found it “risky” for Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish to become chairman, president and CEO, Cigna said in a letter to Anthem's board of directors during June 2015 negotiations. ####  ##### The July agreement said Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, while Mr. Swedish would become chairman and CEO. ####  ##### The Anthem-Express Scripts dispute is another roadblock. ####  ##### “You really don't want to be tied up into large-scale, high-profile litigation when you are trying to get a major merger acquisition through the door of regulators,” Mr. Lekraj said. ####  ##### With the lawsuit, uncertain timeline and Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne S. DeVeydt's unexpected resignation earlier this month, “all of these things together paint a picture that there are troubles and concerns, and the very tough road that we expected has become tougher,” Mr. Zaharuk said. ####  ##### At this point, analysts said, the Aetna-Humana deal is more likely to obtain regulatory approval and that merger looks to be going much more smoothly. ####  ##### An Aetna spokesman said Tuesday that the insurer has obtained 15 of the necessary 20 state approvals. The U.S. Justice Department also must approve the combination. ####  ##### “It seems like they are ahead of the game,” Mr. Zaharuk said of the Aetna-Humana deal. ####  ##### Ana Gupte, New York-based managing director and senior research analyst at Leerink Partners L.L.C., said in a research note Friday that the Anthem-Cigna merger also is at risk due to “meaningful opposition from Fortune 500 employer customers.” ####  ##### Ms. Gupte reduced the odds of the Anthem-Cigna deal closing from 70% to “under 50%,” but still was positive that the Aetna-Humana deal would close. ####  ##### “If the managers' teams can put their egos aside, I believe the deal would pass the Justice Department review,” Mr. Lekraj said of the Anthem-Cigna merger. #### "
"Family of four health insurance tops $25,000 a year in costs ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits, Health Care Costs";" ##### The cost of family coverage offered through employers' health plans is expected to rise only modestly this year, but that still will push the average cost past $25,000, Milliman Inc. said Tuesday. ####  ##### The total cost of coverage for a family of four under an employer-sponsored preferred provider organization plan — including premiums and employees' out-of-pocket expenses — rose 4.7% to an average of $25,886, Seattle-based Milliman said it in its annual “Milliman Medical Index” report. ####  ##### While that is the smallest percentage gain in the history of the analysis that began in 2001, the $1,155 increase is the 11th consecutive year that the annual increase has exceeded $1,100, according to the consulting and actuarial firm. ####  ##### Surpassing $25,000 a year for family coverage is “a significant and somewhat unsettling milestone,” Chris Girod, a San Diego based Milliman principal and consulting actuary, said in a statement. ####  ##### The report attributed much of this year's increase in overall health plan costs to a 9.1% jump in prescription drug costs. At an average of $4,270 per family, prescription drugs account for about 17% of the total cost of coverage. In contrast, all other health care services increased just 3.8%, Milliman said. ####  ##### Employers paid just over 57%, or $14,793, of health plan costs this year, according to the analysis. Employees paid an average of $6,717 in premium contributions and $4,316 in out-of-pocket expenses, such as for health care services that fall under their plans' deductibles. #### "
"Supreme Court kicks Verizon pension derisking back to lower court";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Regulation, Retirement Benefits, General liability";" ##### The U.S. Supreme Court Monday asked a federal appeals court to review the panel's earlier decision upholding the right of communications firm Verizon Communications Inc. to “derisk” the pension plan offered to management employees. ####  ##### Under that arrangement, New York-based Verizon in 2012 transferred about $7.5 billion in benefit obligations to Prudential Insurance Co. of America by purchasing a group annuity. The agreement covered about 41,000 management participants who retired and began receiving benefits before Jan. 1, 2010. ####  ##### Soon after that action, a group of Verizon retirees challenged that the transaction — one of the first in the pension derisking realm. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Dallas, alleged that that Verizon violated a provision in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by not disclosing in its summary plan description that it retained the right to remove participants from its pension plan by transferring benefit obligations to an insurer. ####  ##### The suit argued that ERISA regulations require a summary plan description to include a statement detailing the circumstances that could result in participants losing benefits they would reasonably expect the plan to provide. ####  ##### That suit was later dismissed by a federal judge who said the plaintiffs incorrectly interpreted that regulation as requiring that summary plan descriptions include when benefits will not be provided by a pension plan. ####  ##### In 2015, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling. ####  ##### But in a one-sentence decision, the Supreme Court vacated the appeals court ruling, saying that the court now must review its ruling in light of the high court's decision earlier this month — Spokeo Inc. v. Robins — in which the justices said an injury must be concrete for a plaintiff to sue. ####  ##### A Verizon spokesman said the company doubts the remand will impact the case. ####  ##### “We don't believe the Supreme Court's remand of the case back to the 5th Circuit on the narrow Constitutional standing issue will change the outcome of our case,” the spokesman said in an email statement. ####  ##### But a group representing Verizon pension plan participants welcomed the Supreme Court order. ####  ##### “The order by the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the lower court decision and send it back to be completely re-evaluated is a huge vindication of our argument,” Jack Cohen, chairman of the Cold Spring Harbor, New York-based Association of BellTel Retirees Inc., said in a statement. ####  ##### “The court has sent a powerful message that Verizon retirees — and, by extension, millions of others whose pensions have been de-risked — cannot simply be dismissed. When our assets were sold off without our consent we sought relief through the judicial system and today the highest court in the land said that we must continue to be heard,” Mr. Cohen added. ####  ##### Several dozen companies in recent years have taken actions similar to Verizon's by shifting pension plan liabilities to insurers through the purchase of group annuities. ####  ##### For employers, the appeal of such an approach is that they no longer are exposed to higher than expected contributions to their pension plans, if, for example, investment returns are less than expected and/or interest rates decline, boosting the value of plan liabilities. ####  ##### In addition, through derisking, employers, by reducing the size of their pension plans, also reduce premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. The so-called flat rate PBGC premium is based on the number of participants a company has in its pension plan, while plan sponsors are liable for an additional so-called variable rate premium if their plans are underfunded. #### "
"Lawmakers override Illinois governor's veto on Chicago police, fire pensions ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Regulation, Retirement Benefits, Political Risk";" ##### Chicago's police and fire pension fund contributions will be reduced in the near term after the Illinois General Assembly overrode Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto of the measure. ####  ##### The House and Senate voted Monday to override Mr. Rauner's Friday veto of the bill, which reduces Chicago's required pension payments to the $2.4 billion Chicago Policemen's Annuity & Benefit Fund and the $1 billion Chicago Firemen's Annuity & Benefit Fund over five years, starting in 2016, and extends the deadline for the fire and police pension funds to reach 90% funding to 2055 from the current 2040 deadline. The General Assembly originally passed the bill in May 2015. ####  ##### The measure is expected to reduce Chicago police and fire pension contributions by $220 million in 2016 and $843 million total over the next five years. ####  ##### “In his veto letter to legislators on May 27, Mr. Rauner wrote that the bill continues the “irresponsible practice” of deferring pension funding decisions and sticks taxpayers with higher future pension contributions. ####  ##### “By deferring responsible funding decisions until 2021 and then extending the timeline for reaching responsible funding levels from 2040 to 2055, Chicago is borrowing against its taxpayers to the tune of $18.6 billion,” Mr. Rauner wrote to legislators on May 27. “This practice has to stop. If we continue, we've learned nothing from our past mistakes.” ####  ##### Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rauner, maintained Monday that the bill is another example of politicians “kicking the can down the road” and instead, local and state governments should “focus on reforms that will grow our economy, create jobs and enable us live up to the promises we've made to police and firefighters.” ####  ##### Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel praised legislators on Monday for overriding Mr. Rauner's veto. “On Memorial Day I particularly want to thank the Democrats and Republicans in the General Assembly for putting politics aside and doing the right thing for Chicago taxpayers, and for our first responders,” Mr. Emanuel said in a statement. “We in the city agreed to step up and finally do our part to and responsibly fund these pensions. … While for the first time in history our police and fire pensions will be funded appropriately, I will not rest until and municipal and laborers' pensions are fully secured as well.” #### "

"Participants sue over church-plan status for hospital pension fund ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits, General liability";" ##### Holy Cross Hospital and Sinai Health Systems, Chicago, are being sued by participants of a terminated defined benefit plan who are challenging its church-plan status. ####  ##### The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago alleges that Holy Cross Hospital transferred plan sponsorship and liabilities to an order of nuns, Sisters of Saint Casimir, the day before completing a merger with Sinai Health System in 2012. At the time, the plan had $31 million in liabilities after Holy Cross stopped making contributions in 2007, according to the lawsuit. ####  ##### When SSC terminated the plan two years later, participants were informed that lump-sum benefits would be calculated using a termination discount rate of 13.5%, instead of the 4% rate applied under ERISA, causing some participants to receive less than half the original benefits promised, according to the lawsuit, which claims that Holy Cross’ conduct “was even more egregious” because the pension plan complied with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for 19 years. In 1993, it won approval from the IRS to qualify as a church plan retroactively as of March 1974. That made it exempt from ERISA funding and reporting rules, and benefit guarantees from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### The lawsuit notes that in March, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago denied a bid by Advocate Health Care Network Pension Plan, Downers Grove, Illinois, to be considered a church pension plan on the grounds that it was not established by a church or association of churches. ####  ##### Plaintiffs are asking for joint and several liability for Holy Cross and Sinai Health Systems, payment of the unfunded liabilities plus interest, civil penalties per day per plaintiff, court costs and the appointment of an independent fiduciary. ####  ##### Rachel Dvorken, executive vice president and general counsel for Sinai Health System, declined to comment on the new lawsuit. ####  ##### Karen Handorf, a partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll representing the plaintiffs in Butler et al. vs. Holy Cross Hospital et al., said some former employees have been forced to find additional work and live on reduced incomes. “Holy Cross is an example of why the wrongful claim to church-plan status has serious consequences for retirees who have been denied the benefits that they earned through their years of employment,” Ms. Handorf said in an e-mail. ####  ##### Hazel Bradford writes for Pensions & Investments, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Will health insurers win reimbursement of public exchange losses? ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### A stream of health insurer lawsuits over the government's failure to make promised risk corridor payments under the health care reform law faces an outcome that is far from certain. ####  ##### At least five health insurers and co-operatives have sued the government for failing to make payments through the program meant to offset insurers' losses in their public exchange business. ####  ##### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina sued last week in the Washington-based U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging it is owed $129 million through the risk corridor program established under the Affordable Care Act for its losses in 2014. ####  ##### Fellow Blues affiliate, Pittsburgh-based Highmark Inc. and several subsidiaries, sued in the same court in May, demanding $222.9 million for 2014 public exchange business. ####  ##### Portland, Oregon-based insurer Moda Health Plans Inc. along with failed co-ops Iowa-based CoOportunity Health and Oregon-based insurer Health Republic Insurance Co. of Oregon have filed similar suits. ####  ##### The issue began last year when the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it would pay only 12.6% of the money insurers requested for 2014 losses, with the rest paid in 2015 and 2016 if necessary. CMS has not yet announced the payments it will make for 2015 losses. The program sunsets after this year. ####  ##### Some insurers demand that CMS make those 2014 payments now, but it's unclear whether the lawsuits will succeed. ####  ##### Opposing views ####  ##### Nicholas Bagley, professor of law at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said the insurers have a strong claim. ####  ##### “It's likely that they will prevail in these lawsuits, and they will end up recovering what they are owed,” Mr. Bagley said. ####  ##### But this is an unusual situation, he said. Congress typically appropriates funds to cover obligations under ACA, but refused to do so for the risk corridor program. That, he said, puts the administration, which would like to pay up, in a strange position. ####  ##### “It's not clear how the administration will approach these lawsuits,” he said. ####  ##### Cynthia Borrelli, a principal at New Jersey-based law firm Bressler, Amery & Ross P.C., said in an email that she does “not believe the constitutional arguments have credibility” because funding is “always subject to appropriation” by Congress. ####  ##### Mr. Begley said an argument could be made that the insurers should have waited to sue until the risk corridor program concludes to “find out if it's in the red,” which would be 2017 when CMS calculates 2016 loss payments. ####  ##### Insurers have lost money through public exchange plans primarily because they priced the plans too low in 2014 and 2015, experts say. For example, Highmark said in April that it lost $590 million on its public exchange business in 2015. ####  ##### But while some insurers had factored future risk corridor payments into their exchange plan pricing, that's not a major reason some have lost so much on the exchanges, sources said. They priced poorly with the limited data they had available, source said. ####  ##### Plus some large health insurers were skeptical of the risk corridor program early on, said Chris Sloan, Washington-based senior manager at consultant Avalere Health. Still, co-ops relied heavily on the payments as they had no other lines of business to help offset losses, he said. ####  ##### If the lawsuits fail and insurers don't receive the risk corridor payments they are owed, it could affect their bottom line and “make it harder for them to continue to participate” in the exchange market, Mr. Bagley said. ####  ##### Despite the insurer lawsuits, I don't think these risk corridor payments will affect insurer participation going forward,” said Larry Levitt, Menlo Park, California-based senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ####  ##### Suing for the risk corridor payments is “more about trying to rebuild their surpluses,” Mr. Levitt said. ####  ##### Some said they expect more insurers to sue over the payments. ####  ##### “There's money on the table, Mr. Bagley said. “Why wouldn't you file suit?” #### "
"Health insurance mega-deals aren't winning over large employers ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation, Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Mergers & Acquisitions, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Federal and state insurance regulators are determining the fate of the pending health insurance mergers, and many large employers won't be disappointed if officials torpedo the deals. ####  ##### Several surveys of Fortune 500 companies and other big employers reveal nervousness that the reduced competition among health insurers will mean higher health care costs for them. ####  ##### “Anytime you have a limited market and limited number of key players and they come together, that's not a great thing for a purchaser,” said Larry Boress, CEO of the Midwest Business Group on Health. His coalition surveyed employer members this past December, and 95% of respondents viewed the loss of competition as negative. ####  ##### The tone is especially problematic for Anthem's $53 billion acquisition of Cigna Corp., which recently has faced behind-the-scenes disputes. Both insurers deal a lot with large, self-insured employers — companies that decide to pay for the medical costs of their employees but outsource the provider networking, claims processing and care management functions to insurers. Many of these contracts between self-insured employers and insurance companies are called administrative services only, or ASO. ####  ##### Aetna Inc.'s $37 billion takeover of Humana Inc. has less to do with employer coverage and more to do with Medicare Advantage. ####  ##### Mr. Boress said employers are “quite concerned” the health plan mergers will lead to higher ASO contract fees and worse customer service. Often times, employers will want their own benefits service center for their workers, but merged plans could easily close those sites to avoid duplication and cut costs. ####  ##### Employers that participate in the Pacific Business Group on Health found problems with the rationale that health plans will pass along savings to consumers and the employers, said Bill Kramer, the organization's executive director of national health policy who has had several discussions with top member executives. ####  ##### “I think larger employers are skeptical that will occur,” Mr. Kramer said. “We haven't seen any evidence that will be the case.” ####  ##### Two investment banks, Leerink Partners and J.P. Morgan Securities, also surveyed several high-ranking health benefits executives at self-insured employers and asked them specifically about the Anthem-Cigna deal. J.P. Morgan analyst Gary Taylor summed up the overarching theme: “The survey findings were less positive than we expected.” ####  ##### Thirty percent of J.P. Morgan employer respondents did not believe a combined Anthem-Cigna, Aetna, UnitedHealth Group and state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans offered sufficient competition for the self-insured business. That 30% also believed Anthem and Cigna “would be able to raise ASO fees in an anti-competitive fashion.” J.P. Morgan surveyed 24 benefits executives at large, self-insured companies. ####  ##### “Large employers' views on this question will be a very important source of information for the DOJ, and antitrust attorneys assure us that DOJ is contacting large corporate customers to ask this question,” Mr. Taylor wrote in a synopsis of the survey. ####  ##### Both banks downgraded their admittedly arbitrary probabilities of the U.S. Justice Department approving the Anthem-Cigna deal following the employer reaction. Leerink believes the transaction has a less than 50% chance of surviving, while J.P. Morgan is somewhat more optimistic at 60%. Anthem executives have reiterated confidence the deal will get approval this year. ####  ##### However, employers are also sounding the alarms on other health care pressures, said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health. He believes the traditional structure of paying for every service, treatment or drug without any tie to quality is the main element that needs reform. ####  ##### “The bigger problem is the delivery of services and the way we pay for it,” he said. Mr. Wojcik also noted employers in the National Business Group on Health believe “the rapid consolidation among health systems” is just as troublesome. ####  ##### Anthem and Cigna are both members of the National Business Group on Health. ####  ##### Anthem and Cigna are not members of the Midwest Business Group on Health, but Aetna and Humana are. None of the merging health insurers is part of the Pacific Business Group on Health. ####  ##### Experts testifying to Congress last year used the “sumo wrestler theory” to illustrate why allowing large insurers to grow in size to compete with expanding local and national health systems won't necessarily lead to better prices and lower premiums for employers and consumers. ####  ##### “Experience suggests that a showdown between the sumo wrestlers may well result in a handshake rather than an honest wrestling match,” St. Louis University law professor Thomas Greaney testified to the House last year. ####  ##### Indeed, each business coalition expressed concern that employers are caught in the middle of health care's wide-ranging merger and acquisition frenzy. ####  ##### “The concern about consolidation is that you want to make sure the value and quality of health care doesn't erode,” Mr. Kramer said. “This will be a challenge.” ####  ##### Bob Herman writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"New health reform bill shows why Republicans struggle with replacing ACA";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Health Care Costs, Health Insurers";" ##### Sweeping new legislation unveiled by two congressional Republicans to partly repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act highlights the formidable political and policy challenges the GOP faces in taking on a law that has significantly expanded coverage and made popular changes in insurance practices. ####  ##### The 117-page Health Empowerment Liberty Plan, or HELP, authored by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., offers libertarian-leaning proposals to help Americans buy health insurance or self-insure, guarantee they aren't discriminated against by insurers based on pre-existing medical conditions, equalize tax benefits for buying coverage, and create a more competitive health care delivery system. ####  ##### With most Republicans demanding total repeal of the ACA, what's unusual is that the bill would allow people in ACA exchange plans to keep their plans and premium subsidies or switch to a new system under which everyone is eligible to receive a $2,500-per-person refundable tax credit for buying coverage. ####  ##### “Someone who repeals (Obamacare) is left with nothing,” Rep. Sessions said at a recent news conference to discuss the bill. ####  ##### But the bill would abolish the ACA's requirements that nearly everyone must have insurance and that larger employers must offer coverage to their workers. And in a provision that's likely to prove controversial, it would limit the tax exclusion for employer health plans to $2,500 per employee, exposing companies and workers to taxes for insurance benefits above that threshold. That's interesting because Republicans in Congress have railed against the ACA's Cadillac tax on higher-value employer plans. ####  ##### “Someone who dislikes the Cadillac tax seems to be offering a proposal that functions very similar to the Cadillac tax,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a key figure in helping pass the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### But Joe Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, praised Rep. Sessions and Sen. Cassidy for addressing the health plan tax exclusion issue. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize the exclusion needs to be narrowed or eliminated to control national health care spending, he said, but everyone fears fierce blowback from large employers and labor unions, just as happened with the Cadillac tax. In December, with bipartisan support, Congress postponed the tax for two years, until 2020. ####  ##### “Sessions and Cassidy are pointing to where we ought to go,” Mr. Antos said. “What they're talking about is potentially the first step in a negotiation that might take place next year, (whether presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald) Trump or (presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary) Clinton wins the election.” ####  ##### The Sessions-Cassidy legislation comes as a House Republican task force convened by Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is set to release a health care reform proposal next month, which is expected to include full repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and restructuring of Medicare and Medicaid. ####  ##### It's not clear whether the task force members — or Mr. Trump — will consider including elements of the Sessions-Cassidy bill in their proposals. Unlike the Sessions-Cassidy bill, the House task force proposal won't be presented in legislative form, meaning that the Congressional Budget Office won't be able to score it for its budget impact or how many people would gain or lose insurance. ####  ##### A recent Modern Healthcare survey of 86 top health care industry leaders found that more than two-thirds opposed repealing and replacing the ACA. “I wish that the rhetoric about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act would just cease,” said Dr. Penny Wheeler, CEO of Allina Health System in Minneapolis. “It's wasted noise that our country doesn't need. Focusing attention on what actual aspects of the (law) need to be improved upon would be more of what I'd like people to focus on.” ####  ##### The HELP Act would offer every adult a refundable tax credit averaging $2,500, adjusted by age and geography but not based on income; every child would be eligible for a tax credit averaging $1,500. People could use the tax credit to buy coverage on their own or have their employer apply it to their health plan at work. Alternatively, they could deposit the money in a health savings account and pay directly for their medical expenses. ####  ##### People currently enrolled in ACA exchange plans could keep those plans and their premium subsidies. But those who aren't currently enrolled would only be eligible for the bill's new flat-dollar tax credits. These credits would provide less assistance to lower-income people and more to higher-income people, according to John Goodman, a libertarian health economist who helped Rep. Sessions and Sen. Cassidy develop the plan. ####  ##### Mr. Pollack said replacing the ACA's mean-tested premium subsidies with tax credits for everyone regardless of income would be a poor use of government funds. The ACA subsidy system “ensures that taxpayer help isn't wasted on people who don't need that help,” he said. “This is a major step in the wrong direction.” ####  ##### Sen. Cassidy said at a recent news conference that states could opt for a system with automatic enrollment that would cover everyone through the new tax credit rather than having people sign up for insurance. ####  ##### The bill would abolish federal minimum essential benefits, though it would allow states to regulate coverage. People could buy cheaper limited-benefit plans with an annual cap on benefits. Those who buy such plans would receive asset and wage protection if their medical bills exceeded certain thresholds. ####  ##### It also includes a number of measures to increase transparency and competition, including limits on out-of-network charges, requirements for providers and plans to disclose prices, and deregulation of physician-owned facilities, freestanding surgery centers, and retail clinics. ####  ##### While it wouldn't touch Medicare, the bill would establish a system of federal block grants to the states for each of four Medicaid populations, based on the number of beneficiaries. ####  ##### One observer found the HELP Act intriguingly unconventional but confusing. “It seems far more complicated than the ACA, which is far too complicated to begin with,” said Tim Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee University who is an expert on the reform law. “I credit them with courage for putting an actual proposal out there rather than platitudes. But if the idea is to come up with a simpler way, it's heading in exactly the wrong direction.” ####  ##### On top of that, he warned, the bill could severely disrupt the employer-based insurance system that covers most working-age Americans. Faced with sharp new limits on the deductibility of health benefits, employers could terminate their plans and tell their workers to take their new tax credits to the individual insurance market. ####  ##### “It might be the kind of offbeat thing Trump would like, but I can't imagine mainstream Republicans signing on to anything that looks like actual legislation,” Mr. Jost said. ####  ##### Mr. Antos also doubted the House Republican task force would adopt any of the more controversial elements of the Sessions-Cassidy bill. “I don't think the task force wants to cut off communications with other Republicans,” he said. “But I don't think they'll embrace it or say 'Hell no' either.” ####  ##### Harris Meyer writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"PBGC outlook brightens but not for multiemployer pensions";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits, Financial Results, Voluntary Benefits";" ##### The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. projects in reports issued Friday that the deficit in its single-employer insurance program eventually will disappear, but paints a very different and gloomy picture for its multiemployer insurance program, even with sweeping reform legislation Congress passed in 2014. ####  ##### In its fiscal year 2015 Projections Report, the PBGC projects that by 2025 its single-employer program, which is funded in part by premiums paid by employers with pension plans, will have a $2.6 billion surplus. ####  ##### That is a big change from last year's report, which projected a $4.9 billion deficit in 2024. ####  ##### That future surplus projection for the single-employer insurance program is in stark contrast to the program's current financial position: In 2015, the PBGC reported a $24.1 billion deficit for the insurance program, which guarantees participants' benefits up to certain limits in failed plans the agency takes over. ####  ##### In its report, the PBGC says its projection of an improving financial position for the single employer insurance program is based on several factors, including provisions in legislation Congress passed last year that boosts PBGC insurance premium rates over the next three years. The current $64 per plan participant rate will hit $80 by 2019. ####  ##### In all, the 2015 law will generate an additional $4 billion in premium income for the agency between 2016 and 2025. Last year, employers paid the PBGC about $3.8 billion in premiums. ####  ##### However, the report paints a different and dismal picture for the agency's multiemployer pension plan insurance program, even with the passage of 2014 legislation that allows financially distressed multiemployer plans to cut benefits already earned by participants. ####  ##### The PBGC projects in its report that the multiemployer insurance program deficit will hit $55.5 billion in 2025. At the end of 2025, the PBGC's multiemployer insurance plan is likely to run out of money in 57% of scenarios the agency ran, according to the report. ####  ##### The agency's multiemployer insurance fund is on a “trajectory to become insolvent within 10 years,” Secretary of Labor and PBGC Chair of the Board Thomas Perez wrote in a letter sent Friday to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. ####  ##### And the provision in the 2014 law allowing financially troubled plans to cut benefits to avoid insolvency and the shifting — up to certain limits — of plan liabilities to the PBGC, may not protect the PBGC from big losses. ####  ##### Last month, Treasury Department regulators rejected a proposal by the massively underfunded Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund to cut benefits to avoid failure. ####  ##### The Central States plan is so underfunded — it reported a $17.2 billion deficit in 2014 — that its collapse would completely drain the PBGC multiemployer insurance program, ending the “federal backstop” for benefits earned by multiemployer pension plan participants, Thomas Nyhan, the plan's executive director said earlier. ####  ##### “We must address the funding and other challenges of the multiemployer insurance program before it is too late,” Mr. Perez said. #### "
"Captive insurers' data, greater control help rein in benefits costs ";"Benefits Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Management, Risk Management, Marsh & McLennan, MetLife, Bermuda";" ##### SOUTHAMPTON, Bermuda — Spotting trends and centralizing monitoring and management of global health care costs are advantages that captive insurers can bring to multinational companies that use a captive to fund employee benefits, industry experts say. ####  ##### Managing risk on a global basis is challenging. Corporate benefit programs cover employees in different countries with varying tax environments, labor laws and social security systems. Benefit designs vary by country, said Marc Reinhardt, Parsippany, New Jersey-based head of sales and distribution at director of the Americas at Generali Employee Benefits Network, a unit of Italy-based Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. ####  ##### “Multinational companies that are looking for ways to manage the costs of employee health benefits are shifting their focus from financial savings through driving down rates or higher benefit limits to data analytics and service management and aggregation,” Mr. Reinhardt said Tuesday during the 2016 Bermuda Captive Conference in Southampton, Bermuda. ####  ##### “Data is an important component of managing health care benefits,” said Eric Butler, New York-based vice president of global health care at MetLife Inc. “An aging population, changes in technology, drugs or surgeon tools — these medical trends are the big changes in health care costs.” ####  ##### Serving 480,000 employees in 220 countries, the employee benefits captive at Deutsche Post DHL, a mail and package delivery company, is one of the largest in the world, said Bill Fitzpatrick, its London-based vice president of global insurance and risk management. ####  ##### “Instead of having DHL individual business units buying local contracts, we consolidate those and bring them into a central network. We are seeing significant cost savings of 18% to 20% in premiums over local market product offerings,” he said of the captive that provides health insurance for each of its businesses and other coverage  including marine cargo, aviation and workers compensation. ####  ##### “The average health care costs are increasing 8% to 10% per year,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “How long can these benefits plans be sustainable? By 2020, our spending will have doubled if we do nothing. To bend that trend line, we would have to cost shift to the employees or eliminate benefits, which is why we turned to the captive program” established in  1996 with benefits added in 2011. ####  ##### Multinational employee benefits were the fastest growing risk placed in captive insurers last year, insurance brokerage Marsh L.L.C. said in a May report. #### "

"Broadspire TPA unit bolsters Crawford & Co.'s third-quarter results";"Workers Comp";"Workers Comp Coverage, Crawford & Co., Financial Results";" ##### Revenues and profits fell in the third quarter for Crawford & Co., though the claims management provider's results were bolstered by its third-party administration unit, Broadspire Services Inc. ####  ##### For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Atlanta-based Crawford reported net income of $13.7 million, down 26% from $18.5 million during the third quarter of 2012. The company reported revenues of $313.5 million for the recent quarter, down 3% from revenues of $324.2 million during the same period last year. ####  ##### For the first nine months of 2013, Crawford reported net income of $40.3 million and revenues of $946.7 million. That's compared with net income of $35.4 million and revenues of $930.6 million during the same period of 2012. ####  ##### In a statement Monday, Crawford said it expected third-quarter results to show a decline as the company wrapped up “significant” projects related to flooding in Thailand in 2011. However, it noted that the company saw positive results from Broadspire, which provides workers compensation, liability claim and medical management services. ####  ##### “We are pleased with the progress being made in this important business segment, which is reporting positive operating earnings year-to-date and is more than $5 million ahead of last year at this time,” Crawford President and CEO Jeffrey T. Bowman said in a statement Monday. “We continue to be focused on driving ongoing operating improvements in Broadspire and remain optimistic that we will show sustained operating profitability as we close 2013.” #### "

"QBE North America Launches Diversity & Inclusion Speaker Series with Gay Former U.S. Marine ";"";"";" ##### In celebration of LGBT Pride Month, QBE North America last month sponsored its inaugural Diversity & Inclusion Speaker Series, featuring retired U.S. Marine Staff Sergeant Eric Alva. By coming out in 2007 as a gay former U.S. Marine, Mr. Alva played an integral role in the repeal of the 1993 “Don't ask, don't tell” policy that prohibited people who are openly gay from serving in the military, but protected solders from having to reveal their sexual orientation. ####  ##### Organized by QBE's PROUD Business Resource Group, a group consisting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, more than 150 people attended the standing-room-only event that included an audience of QBE employees, clients and community representatives. ####  ##### “I am a marine, veteran, Hispanic, disabled, gay man,” Mr. Alva said as he stood before the crowd, commanding its attention through his confidence in asserting that he belongs to four distinct groups within the spectrum of diversity. The impact of his statement set an endearing tone as he proceeded to share his story about DADT. ####  ##### Serving in the military had been a life-long dream for the former Marine, who began service at the age of 19. “I always looked up to my grandfather and my father, which I still do, and so, I always wanted to be in the military,” said Mr. Alva. “I wanted to serve my country.” ####  ##### Throughout his 13-year military career, Mr. Alva had been deployed to many locations around the world, including Somalia where he was involved in the logistics setup for Operation Restore Hope. But it was the last deployment of his career, Operation Iraqi Freedom, that would change his life forever. On March 21, 2003, the staff sergeant and 11 other troops had “stopped outside the city of Basra to re-group before entering the city to secure it from Iraq Forces,” he told the audience. Within three hours of occupying the area, Mr. Alva stepped on a land mine that exploded and seriously injured his right leg, which would become partially amputated, and also severed part of an index finger. “I thought I was going to die,” Alva said. “I started saying my goodbyes.” ####  ##### Mr. Alva spent seven months recovering from his injuries and preparing for his new life, which now included the category of “disabled,” yet he continued to conceal his sexual orientation: Gay. As the first American to be seriously injured during the war, this Purple Heart recipient received national attention, which included an interview with Oprah, an article in People magazine as well as a visit by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. ####  ##### The tragic incident had turned him into a celebrity who was also considered to be an eligible bachelor available for a bride. “Everybody put me up on this pedestal that he's the first American, he's our hero,” Mr. Alva explained. He was often approached by people who expressed “…you should marry my daughter or you should meet my daughter.” People wondered why he was always alone. ####  ##### Mr. Alva played the role of a straight man throughout his military career, knowing that DADT would end his military career with a dishonourable discharge if he had openly declared himself gay. Mr. Alva expressed to the crowd that he hated covering up his sexual orientation and “wondered what it would be like if people saw the truth.” However, one evening, he revealed to one of his colleagues that he was gay. The news quickly spread among his peer group, but it stopped there. They had all worked with him, they respected him, and they did not see where his sexual orientation had impacted his ability to do his job. No one ever reported the staff sergeant's secret. ####  ##### In 2004, after a seven-month stay in the hospital, Mr. Alva retired from the U.S. military and began to carve out a new life for himself by enrolling in college, majoring in social work. Mr. Alva said he began to learn more about, “my own diversity…disabled, Hispanic, a veteran and gay,” yet he continued to face the unsettling realization that while people were putting him on a pedestal, no one really knew the truth about who he was. ####  ##### In 2005, the state of Texas, where he resided, “passed a state constitutional ban against gay marriage. Other states were also proposing similar bans to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. “They had all these states where…I almost died for the people of this country, and I don't have the same opportunities or privileges or blessings, and that's so unfair,” said Mr. Alva. “I got to watching the news more…and I just finally…reached my boiling point.” ####  ##### Fed up with the limited rights for people who are LBGT, in 2006, the retired staff sergeant reached out to the Human Rights Campaign, a national group that advocates for LGBT rights, with the intent of simply volunteering but was met with the challenge to come out publicly. ####  ##### “You are like our golden ticket,” Mr. Alva said, recalling the HRC's response to his desire to volunteer. “You got injured in the war. You served your country, and there are people like you getting discharged every day…from the military just solely for being gay…come out publicly. Not just in your city, but to the world.” ####  ##### This was a huge responsibility, but with the encouragement and support of his parents, Mr. Alva moved forward with the HRC's plan. An initial step was Mr. Alva announcing his sexual orientation on the ABC News morning show Good Morning America. And a few months later, in 2007, he began working with members of the U.S. House of Representatives on the Military Readiness Enhancement Act to repeal DADT. ####  ##### Efforts to repeal the law included Mr. Alva testifying in 2008 before the House Armed Services Committee about his experiences, the contributions and skills of the members of military who are LGBT, and the thousands of men and women who had been discharged because of their sexual orientation. ####  ##### In December 2010, almost four years after publicly declaring that he was gay, the former staff sergeant stood next to President Obama as he signed into law the repeal of DADT. “You're standing next to the most powerful person in the world,” Mr. Alva said, “to watch him take the pen and put the ink to paper was historic.” ####  ##### The QBE Proud event was held in recognition of Gay Pride Month in June, which coincided with the tragic events in Orlando at a gay nightclub."" In remembrance of the victims and in acknowledgment of the LGBT community's fight towards acceptance and inclusion, QBE CEO Russ Johnston led the audience in a moment of silence. ####  ##### “The senseless attack on the LGBTQ community in Orlando sparked outrage in our company,” said Mr. Johnston. “The QBE Foundation made a $10,000 donation to Equality Florida Institute, Inc., and after the recent Orlando attack in the LGBTQ community, we are matching employee contributions to this charity which is supporting the victim's families.” ####  ##### Retired Staff Sergeant Eric Alva will be the closing keynote speaker at the Business Insurance “Absolute Inclusion” conference on Thursday, Sept. 29 in Chicago.

"View from Washington: Climate change questions";"Opinion";"";" ##### Will he or won’t he? That’s a question that applies to a lot of topics and will remain unanswered until President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. The subject I’m wondering about in particular is if Mr. Trump will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. ####  ##### The December 2015 accord was a milestone event that some doubted was possible. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations toward a potential solution to stave off the warming of the planet stalled for years due to bitter disputes over whether and how to mandate participation and who should pay for adaptation efforts in countries most vulnerable to climate change. But last year’s agreement on voluntary contributions aimed at holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels was a breakthrough in every sense of the word. ####  ##### This year’s talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, were rocked by the U.S. presidential election results, which introduced a layer of uncertainty and anxiety. ####  ##### But it also led other participating countries to express strong support and move forward on key procedural elements needed to fully implement the agreement. ####  ##### Before the election, Mr. Trump said he doesn’t believe that climate change is real, accused China of making up climate change to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive and vowed to dismantle the agreement. He has since softened his tone, saying he would keep an open mind. ####  ##### However, Mr. Trump’s selection of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the new head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not bode well for continued efforts by the federal government to address climate change impacts. Mr. Pruitt is a vocal opponent of current EPA efforts to restrain carbon emissions, even suing the agency over its Clean Power Plan — seen as a major contributor to the U.S. efforts to meet its Paris climate agreement reduction target. ####  ##### Any effort by the Trump administration to withdraw from the agreement would take time and could be met with resistance by other countries in the form of tariffs on U.S. goods — France has already threatened such action. And abandoning the Clean Power Plan is unlikely to reverse the trend away from fossil fuels toward cleaner forms of energy, with the boom in natural gas supplies making them more affordable than ever. ####  ##### But risk managers can’t afford to get bogged down in the political debate over climate change and the human contribution, as more than one person in the industry has told me recently. They must move fast to make sure their properties are protected from impending natural catastrophes, as well as the more gradual threat posed by rising sea levels, and that their supply chains remain intact. And they must get extremely creative as properties in certain parts of the world become uninsurable because of climate impacts. ####  ##### The question is will risk managers have an ally in Mr. Trump or will he hinder those efforts by abandoning the Clean Power Plan and withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement? We’ll know soon enough. #### "
"Legal developments in D&O";"Opinion";"D&O, E&O, General liability";" ##### When it comes to directors and officers liability insurance coverage litigation, a few key areas often pose challenges to insurers and to policyholders. ####  ##### Three significant issues that often arise in D&O disputes have recently been the subject of judicial developments: ####  ##### • Whether a settlement constitutes insurable “loss” under a D&O policy ####  ##### • Various cases interpreting the definition of “professional services” as used in D&O policies ####  ##### • Cases addressing the application of the “insured v. insured” exclusion in unusual circumstances ####  ##### Insurability of ‘loss’ ####  ##### D&O insurance policies provide coverage for “loss,” a defined term that typically includes settlements and judgments. As determined by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Level 3 Communications Inc. v. Federal Insurance Co. in 2001, “a ‘loss’ within the meaning of an insurance contract does not include the restoration of an ill-gotten gain.” This is the case for a number of reasons, including that an insured has not “lost” anything when he or she returns what he or she never should have had in the first place, as well as because of the moral hazard of allowing insurance coverage for such damages. Judge Richard Posner’s statement in Level 3 remains generally accepted as a principle by courts throughout the country. As such, by way of example, a settlement or judgment representing the return of ill-acquired lost profits would not constitute an insurable “loss” under insurance policies. ####  ##### In the past few years, however, a few courts have attempted to distinguish the circumstances presented in Level 3. These courts held that particular settlements did not constitute “restitution,” notwithstanding arguments by the insurer to the contrary. For example, in 2015 a Delaware trial court in Gallup Inc. v. Greenwich Insurance Co. held that it was insufficient for an insurer to point to the allegations in the underlying complaint as evidence that the settlement represented the return of ill-gotten gains, and required the insurer to provide evidence that the settlement was restitutionary. ####  ##### In 2016, another Delaware trial court held that a settlement payment did not constitute disgorgement in the absence of a “conclusive link” proving that the insured committed misconduct. In TIAA-CREF Individual & Institutional Services L.L.C. v. Illinois National Insurance Co., the court did note, however, that “a different outcome in which disgorgement payments are deemed insurable might result when parties settle under different circumstances.” Nevertheless, most courts use the allegations of a claimant’s complaint to determine whether a settlement or judgment is restitutionary in character. And, as noted, the TIAA-CREF and Gallup courts both allowed for the possibility that a settlement might constitute uninsurable restitution in other circumstances. As such, policyholders and insurers should closely examine the law of the relevant jurisdiction and the facts of a particular case in order to determine whether coverage could be available for a particular settlement. ####  ##### What are ‘professional services’? ####  ##### Whether a given activity constitutes a “professional service” is often important in D&O insurance for two separate reasons. ####  ##### First, many D&O policies contain a professional services exclusion that bars coverage for suits arising from an insured’s professional services. Second, some policies may be “blended” — meaning that they afford both traditional D&O insurance as well as traditional errors and omissions insurance, the latter of which usually affords specified coverage for errors and omissions in rendering an insured’s professional services. ####  ##### In 2015 in Goldberg v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., a Florida trial court ruled: “(T)he term ‘professional services’ unambiguously refers to services unique to a specific profession.” Two recent cases illustrate the distinction between services that are “unique” to a given profession and services that are not. ####  ##### In Goldberg v. National Union, a group of directors and officers of an insured bank were alleged to have engaged in managerial acts in furtherance of a Ponzi scheme by one of their customers. For instance, one of the officers was alleged to have “disregarded obvious warning flags, red flags, and overt warnings from some subordinates” about the Ponzi scheme. The directors and officers sought coverage under a D&O policy, asserting that the professional services exclusion did not bar coverage because they were engaged in “purely internal management and regulatory functions — not services for others.” The court disagreed, stating that any failure by the directors was “done in order to” facilitate the insured’s banking services for its customer. As such, these acts “arose out of” professional services performed by the insured. ####  ##### However, not every act by a professional will constitute a professional service. This is illustrated by the decision in a 2016 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Edwards v. Continental Casualty Co. There, an insured lawyer received a portion of a client’s personal injury settlement with the client’s employer pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement. ####  ##### The employer later sued to rescind the settlement agreement on the grounds that the client had feigned his injuries. The employer also sought the return of funds from the client’s lawyer, even though it alleged that the lawyer was unaware of the client’s conduct. In this case, the court held that the suit did not arise from an “act or omission” by the lawyer in rendering professional services. Rather, the lawyer was only named in the suit because he received the settlement funds at issue, not because he made some mistake in his conduct as a lawyer. ####  ##### Edwards was a 2-1 decision, demonstrating that where to draw the line between acts connected to professional services and those not connected can sometimes be debatable. As such, directors and officers should consider carrying both D&O and E&O insurance to limit potential gaps in coverage. ####  ##### ‘Insured v. insured’ exclusion ####  ##### Most D&O policies contain an “insured v. insured” exclusion, which bars coverage in connection with disputes brought by one insured against another. Among other purposes, such exclusions limit the potential for collusive disputes among various insured parties under a policy. They also avoid insuring against intrafamily disputes within an insured company. ####  ##### The applicability of the insured v. insured exclusion is not always clear-cut. To take one example, is a claim brought by the FDIC as receiver for a failed insured bank against the former directors of that insured bank a claim brought “on behalf of” one insured against another? ####  ##### Courts have recently come out on different sides of this issue. Last year, in St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the exclusion was ambiguous as to the FDIC, and therefore held that the exclusion did not preclude coverage. ####  ##### However, courts analyzing different policy language have interpreted the exclusion differently. In Hawker v. BancInsure Inc., a California trial court considered whether an exclusion barring coverage for “a claim by, or on behalf of, or at the behest of, any other insured person, the company, or any successor, trustee, assignee or receiver of the company” barred coverage for claims brought by the FDIC as receiver against insureds. Here, the policy language specifically referred to any “receiver” of the company. ####  ##### Accordingly, the court concluded that this claim for coverage by the FDIC failed. ####  ##### Like those issues with receivership, issues concerning insolvency or bankruptcy of insureds have posed challenges for courts interpreting insured v. insured exclusions in recent years. For example, in 2016 in Indian Harbor Insurance Co. v. Zucker, a Michigan trial court considered whether coverage for a claim brought by a litigation trust of an insured bank against its former directors or officers was precluded by an insured v. insured exclusion that barred coverage where a claim was brought “in the name or right of” the insured bank. The court determined that it was. The court surveyed case law nationwide, and noted that there were a number of “inconsistent decisions across the country” concerning the insured v. insured exclusion. ####  ##### In this case, the court held that the litigation trust’s claim was precluded. The court performed a fact-specific inquiry, and concluded that the fact that the insured bank “voluntarily” transferred causes of action to the litigation trust created a “direct connection” between the bank and the trust. Accordingly, the court held that the insured v. insured exclusion applied to bar coverage. As this illustrates, application of this exclusion is not always clear-cut, and courts will closely examine relevant policy language and the specific facts and circumstances of the matter to determine whether coverage is barred by an insured v. insured exclusion. ####  ##### David H.

"Business interruption meets cyber risk coverage";"Opinion";"Cyber Risks, Excess & Surplus Lines, P/C Insurers";" ##### As more businesses come to realize that cyber attacks pose a serious threat to business operations, revenue streams and contingency planning, the market is starting to expand and develop new products to address business interruption, or BI, resulting from a cyber attack. Some of the more common cyber attacks against businesses include denial-of-service, brute force (to obtain passwords), insertion of malware or malicious code, ransomware, backdoor attacks and social engineering. This article provides a primer on the issues that may arise when the traditional concept of first-party BI coverage is married to cyber coverage. ####  ##### BI coverage is a time-element coverage offered under first-party property policies. In the first-party context, for BI coverage to be implicated, there must be insured direct physical loss or damage by a covered cause of loss that causes a necessary interruption of the insured’s operations, either wholly or partially as specified in the policy. Once these conditions are met, then the actual loss sustained is measured to determine the loss of business income from the interruption. ####  ##### It is important to remember that first-party property policies do not traditionally extend property loss or damage to electronic data, as data is not considered a physical or tangible object subject to loss or damage. When BI coverage is offered for cyber policies, the direct physical loss or damage requirement may be substituted with an electronic data driven event — a specified type of cyber attack. ####  ##### The scope and elements of what constitutes a cyber attack in the policy is therefore of critical importance. In other words, what triggers BI coverage for a network attack? As noted above, BI coverage was originally intended for physical loss and is now being imported into the ethereal and nonphysical world. ####  ##### As part of a triggering event for BI coverage, there must be a direct causal connection between the cyber attack and the interruption of business and loss of revenue. For an active attack, where an adversary or perpetrator destroys or alters data that brings down the computer system, or a denial of service takes place and business operations cease, the causal connection to any business loss should be fairly straightforward to establish. ####  ##### However, the causal connection is less clear in a situation involving a passive network attack, when a computer system is infiltrated but the perpetrator is only gathering data or exploring the system, and no data is disturbed, altered or destroyed. ####  ##### In such a situation, a network attack took place and remedial measures are necessary, but computer operations may continue uninterrupted while the security of the system is being restored and any malicious software is neutralized. Although the cyber policy may respond and pay for the expenses to restore the network security under other coverages, a BI loss has not been established inasmuch as there would be no interruption of operations. ####  ##### Another scenario could involve a passive attack combined with a public disclosure that an insured’s network has been compromised. In that situation, daily business operations would continue unhindered, but there might be a loss of customers and revenue resulting from security concerns. On one hand, the network attack took place and the loss of network security is driving away customers; the insured is likely to contend that network security is an intrinsic service that it provides to customers. ####  ##### On the other hand, relying on traditional concepts of BI coverage, there would be no complete or even partial suspension of the insured’s network operations. The loss of revenue would be based on customers’ decisions, and thus the causal connection of what is being insured — suspension/ interruption of operations — is not tied to the loss of revenue. Additionally, if the customer no longer wants the insured’s services, that may also be a “loss of market” situation, which is normally excluded in BI policies. ####  ##### There are countless cyber attack situations that can arise. Therefore, when a cyber attack claim is presented and adjusted, the policy wording and what constitutes the triggering event, as well as the causal relationship of the network attack to the revenue loss, must be examined closely. At times, it may be a challenge to correlate which incurred costs are associated with the covered event versus noncovered costs, such as a permanent upgrade to network security. Adding to the complexity of analyzing a cyber BI claim is the insurer’s reliance on the insured’s cooperation on openly sharing what exactly took place in its system from the attack and how these compromised systems tie into its operations and revenue streams. ####  ##### As part of BI coverage, the extent of financial reimbursement for a covered revenue loss is also controlled by other important policy provisions, as listed below: ####  ##### • The specified BI sublimit in the policy will set forth the maximum BI exposure for the insurer. Regardless of the revenue loss, the BI sublimit caps the payout under the policy. The BI sublimit may at times be tied to an annual BI aggregate limit — the maximum payable in the policy period if separate network attacks take place. ####  ##### • Policies that provide BI coverage will often include a separate BI deductible or BI waiting period, either in hours or days, before liability will arise under the policy. If a BI loss is below the deductible or does not exceed the waiting period, then the policy will not respond. An example of the waiting period not being met would be if a denial-of-service lasts two hours and the waiting period is four hours. ####  ##### • BI policies will also provide that liability is only for the specified period of restoration. This period is usually a defined time period and requires the insured to use due diligence and dispatch to resume its operations. ####  ##### • BI coverage for network attacks is usually restricted by excepting certain types of costs that are not covered. Costs that are not covered can include third-party liability, contractual liability, fines and penalties, and upgrades for the restoration of network security. ####  ##### • In addition to certain types of noncovered costs, there will be certain BI exclusions, that can include idle periods when insured is not in operation for other reasons, consequential loss or loss of market. In addition, cyber policies typically exclude loss by insured perils under a first-party property policy, such as fire, smoke, explosion, earthquake and other events, as these physical perils are not the intended risk being insured. Service interruption of utilities is also commonly excluded. ####  ##### Unlike other types of insurance, BI coverage is more nuanced, in that overlapping conditions must be examined as part of the determination of whether a BI claim is compensable. The starting point for making such an analysis is a comprehensive understanding of the cyber attack that took place, what was affected and its impact on operations, along with a careful reading of the policy. ####  ##### Costantino P.

"View from Washington: GOP fails legislative debut";"Opinion";"";" ##### Will the self-inflicted death blow to the Republicans’ first major legislative effort spell disaster for the rest of their agenda? ####  ##### The Republican effort to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law imploded last month when the U.S. House of Representatives abandoned Speaker Paul Ryan’s proposed legislation due to a shortage of yea votes. ####  ##### The Republican proponents of the bill did their best to cherry-pick parts of a Congressional Budget Office estimate that worked in their favor, namely that the bill would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion over the 2017-2026 period. At their worst, they also criticized the hard-working CBO employees for their prediction that 24 million people would be left uninsured under the legislation. But the bill was clearly doomed by a combination of public outcry over the prospect of a huge increase in the number of people uninsured, which spooked some Republican legislators, and conservative Republicans’ feeling that the replacement bill did not go far enough in unwinding the Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### The Republican Party was so deeply divided over whether to demolish the law or reform it in a way that kept some of its most popular provisions that not even threats from their Twitter-happy leader could compel members to get in line to vote for the bill. ####  ##### “We had no votes from the Democrats,” President Trump said in trying to pass the blame. ####  ##### No kidding. The Democrats were not going to help the Republicans in any way, shape or form overturn the health care law after they paid such a high political price for that legislative victory in the midterm elections during Mr. Obama’s first term. And the Democrats are clearly in no mood to cooperate on much else these days, as demonstrated by their threatened filibuster of the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. ####  ##### “He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.” So, the Republicans face the prospect of heading into the April recess having failed both to repeal a law they have been railing against for the better part of seven years and to confirm the president’s choice for the Supreme Court seat. ####  ##### What’s next? Well, President Trump may be ready to move on to something that he understands from his days as a businessman is quite complicated: reforming the U.S. tax code. His tax plan pledged that “no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop,” will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Comprehensive tax reform could benefit the bottom line of insurers, and therefore, insurance buyers. ####  ##### Republicans could also continue their deregulation push. Largely on party-line votes, Congress has quickly adopted several Congressional Review Act resolutions overturning Obama administration midnight rules, including a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation mandating employers keep injury and illness records for five years. I’d expect more tight votes on regulations that continue to divide the parties, including the Federal Communications Commission’s internet privacy rules adopted last October. ####  ##### But the Republicans failed their first major test by not agreeing on how to do away with Obamacare. That does not bode well for the rest of their agenda. #### "
"Insurers must take the lead on disaster resilience coverage";"Opinion";"";" ##### Wildfires in California and Alberta, floods in Louisiana, drought and Ebola in Africa and Zika in the Americas and Asia: all reminders of how unprepared we are for the natural catastrophes that accompany climate change and globalization. They are reminders, too, that public and charitable funding for disaster recovery is often inconsistent, inefficient, and insufficient. ####  ##### But a new group of public-private partnerships has pioneered a different approach to recovery funding — using insurance mechanisms to shift risk from public agencies to international financial markets, and leveraging philanthropic and public-sector funds to develop new innovative risk-sharing programs. ####  ##### By creating ways to cover occurrences once considered uninsurable, these publicprivate partnerships have turned disaster recovery into a robust business and investment opportunity — for example, catastrophe bond purchases have grown 10% annually since 2009, with $26 billion currently in the market. And they have given public agencies a very cost-effective financing tool: Lloyd’s Global Underinsurance Report published in October 2012 indicated that a 1% increase in insurance penetration can reduce the cost of disasters to taxpayers by up to 22%. A recent example of making insurance markets work for a greater public good is the $29 million insurance payout from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility to Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, the Grenadines and Barbados, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. Though modest, the money has been used to help at least 1.4 million affected people to date. ####  ##### The insurance industry has been a “slow follower” in this important new market, initially questioning whether events such as climate change and disease epidemics were insurable propositions, and whether such products could drive revenues. Yet disaster resilience insurance is indeed proving to be viable, providing an attractive opportunity for the insurance industry — a virtually untapped global market, where big-data and remote sensing technologies ease risk analysis and pricing, and funding from philanthropies and governments reduces initial product research and development costs. ####  ##### Given the size of this new market — research from Swiss Re Ltd. in 2015 notes that 70% of global economic losses from natural disasters are uninsured, as are 80% to 100% of all economic losses in emerging markets — the disaster insurance business could help relieve the industry’s current problems with weak economic forecasts, underutilized capital and mounting competition in their traditional markets. ####  ##### One of the market’s pioneering efforts is the Extreme Climate Facility, or XCF, being created by African Risk Capacity, a Johannesburg-based agency of the African Union. Designed to help African governments address climate change-driven weather shocks such as extreme heat and droughts, XCF will issue up to a billion dollars’ worth of catastrophe bonds in the next three decades — with coupon payments or premiums to global investors, funded in this case by international development organizations and foundations. ####  ##### Another innovative program in the works is the Pandemic Emergency Financing facility, an insurance solution for curbing pandemic risk launched by the Washingtonbased World Bank Group. Funded by investor-purchased “pandemic catastrophe bonds” and by insurance and reinsurance contracts with coupon payments funded by development organizations, the PEF seeks to enable fast response to pandemics in low-income countries. ####  ##### Building on cornerstones such as CCRIF, ARC and the PEF, the disaster resilience insurance market is poised to grow for decades. And insurers should be entering the market — working closely with governments, development organizations and philanthropies to create customertailored products. As they do, they should be mindful of the lessons learned by the market’s pioneers and note three imperatives: ####  ##### Imperative One: Align expectations about what insurance can do. ####  ##### Too often, public and development-sector organizations, including nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations and foundations, view insurance as a panacea for disaster response. In reality, it works only for carefully defined, nonfrequent events. It cannot underwrite broad disaster recovery capacities, nor eliminate the need for preparedness funding from public coffers, development loans, and international aid. ####  ##### Insurers must help development-sector organizations understand what these products are meant to accomplish, generally and specifically. They need to ensure that payers and policyholders know exactly what their policies will and won’t pay for and prompt them to develop a funding plan for essential services or commodities uncovered by insurance. ####  ##### If companies fail in this “education” imperative, they risk having disappointed public- and development-sector leaders question the effectiveness and value of these products as public finance tools. ####  ##### Imperative Two: Reduce any complexity and uncertainty that slows down payouts. ####  ##### A core benefit of disaster resilience insurance is quick access to funds, circumventing delays by bureaucratic, process-heavy public systems and international development agencies. Anything that slows down payouts diminishes their value at the front end of crises. This happened in Mexico last year after Hurricane Patricia. The government had previously issued a $315 million catastrophe bond, which seemingly transferred the risk of hurricane losses to global capital markets and locked in disaster-relief funding. Unfortunately, the payout was delayed three months by disagreement on whether the event warranted a 100% payout or merely 50%. ####  ##### To avoid these situations, companies must identify and where necessary develop mechanisms and triggers that leave no room for dispute between themselves, payers, regulators and policyholders. ####  ##### Imperative Three: Create a safety net to mitigate innovation risk. ####  ##### The disaster resilience insurance market is still nascent and there will be growing pains. Risk is unavoidable when innovation is so central to the market’s development and when the market’s context — a world undergoing climate change and issues increasingly crossing national boundaries — is uniquely unsettled. The private sector understands these challenges. It accepts that not all disaster resilience insurance solutions will work as intended right out of the box. It knows that complex products often need recalibration and refinement. ####  ##### But public- and development-sector leaders do not have the same tolerance for risk or patience for the process, especially when it means that the poor and vulnerable populations affected by catastrophes are left even more exposed to suffering. ####  ##### African Risk Capacity confronted this risk-tolerance problem when a drought insurance product purchased by the Government of Malawi initially underestimated the number of people affected by drought during the 2015-2016 season. As a result, despite widespread shortage of rain and food on the ground, a payout was not triggered. ####  ##### The problem was one of data used, not intent or technology; and the situation was ultimately resolved when it was determined through field surveys that the governmentprovided technical data underpinning the insurance contract, including the variety of maize used for farming, was not in line with the actual farmer practices. ####  ##### Insurers should anticipate the differential in risk tolerance and address it head-on with their public-, development- and philanthropicsector partners. Their mutual goal should be creating a “safety net” that permits product innovation and refinement while protecting affected populations. One option is a contingency fund to help communities when an insurance product needs technical recalibration. This kind of joint investment will afford insurers space and time to reinforce the quality and credibility of the disaster resilience insurance model. ####  ##### Toward both profit and resilience ####  ##### Disaster resilience insurance can become an indispensable product — a major contributor to public-sector recovery funding and a robust new market for insurers whose traditional business lines are constricting. But for disaster resilience insurance to succeed, insurers must take the lead. They must guide their new collaborators through the complex process of creating and refining products. They must foster the market’s growth by promoting wide adoption of their products. They must build confidence that their products will consistently help to protect vulnerable communities around the globe. ####  ##### Saadia Madsbjerg is a managing director with The Rockefeller Foundation.

"View from Washington: Will Trump get another chance at high court pick?";"Opinion";"";" ##### Will the U.S. Supreme Court’s so-called swing vote swing the court in favor of employers by giving up his seat? ####  ##### Mere days after Neil Gorsuch was officially sworn in to fill the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 came speculation that 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has been on the court since 1988, could soon retire. The speculation was fueled by someone presumably in the know: Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. While he didn’t specifically name Justice Kennedy, Sen. Grassley said he expected a justice resignation as soon as this summer. ####  ##### This news is noteworthy coming so quickly after Justice Gorsuch was confirmed using the “nuclear option,” meaning Senate rules were changed to allow his confirmation with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Now that the precedent has been set, far more controversial justices on either end of the political spectrum could be approved with simple majority votes. ####  ##### Justice Gorsuch was generally seen as a good pick for employers, although perhaps not as good as Justice Scalia. But the newest associate justice — so new his picture is still not up on the Supreme Court’s biography page — is clearly no fan of the Chevron deference, which refers to the concept established in a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court case, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc., that requires courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of laws it implements or enforces. The Chevron deference is already under challenge via a legislative proposal, but even if that bill doesn’t pass, Justice Gorsuch’s resistance to the concept bodes well for employers who may find themselves on the wrong end of workplace safety citations from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration or enforcement orders from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or another federal agency. ####  ##### Justice Gorsuch once clerked for Justice Kennedy, who has been the deciding vote on many critical and controversial decisions, including Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case in which the Supreme Court decided by a 5-4 margin that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed a fundamental marriage right to same-sex couples. Liberals would be wise to worry that a replacement selected by President Donald Trump and confirmed by a simple majority in the Senate could tip the balance of power to the conservative side for years to come and leave them on the losing side of cases such as Obergefell. Even though the president and then-nominee Gorsuch have both called same-sex marriage “settled law,” there’s no guarantee that a Justice Kennedy replacement would feel the same. ####  ##### But for now, employers have Justice Kennedy in the middle of the restored balance of conservatives and liberals on the court. How long that lasts will be a great guessing game — something Washington excels at. #### "
"Ten considerations for projecting self-insured workers compensation losses ";"Opinion";"Workers Comp Cost Control, Workers Comp Coverage";" ##### Projecting self-insured workers compensation losses is a complex process due to its long-tail nature and the many factors that can significantly impact the final costs of claims. A proper actuarial review can provide valuable insight and tailor estimates to each unique self-insurance program. The following discusses the top 10 considerations used by actuaries for projecting self-insured workers compensation losses and integrating them into the projection process. ####  ##### 1. Collecting claims and exposure data ####  ##### Claims and exposure data are the key inputs when projecting self-insured losses. It is important to keep clean, organized records of a program’s historical data because inconsistencies can compromise the accuracy of results. Treatment of subrogation and other recoveries should be clearly and consistently applied. Likewise, allocated loss adjustment expenses should be treated consistently if losses are limited to retention, as they may not erode the limit depending on the excess insurance or large deductible policy purchased. In addition, policies may include other limits or deductibles , which need to be captured. Payroll is often chosen as a preferred exposure metric because it directly correlates with the cost of benefits provided to injured employees, but it can be inconsistently measured. Items excluded should remain constant over time, such as bonuses and vacation time. Because exposures are used on a relative basis to measure change in program size, a change in reporting of exposures can signal a false change in program size. ####  ##### 2. Loss development ####  ##### Loss development serves as the foundation for many estimation methods used by actuaries when selecting ultimate losses. Data is usually organized into so-called loss development triangles, which are constructed using claims data — often organized by accident/policy period — at multiple valuation dates and which present an effective way to analyze how a program’s losses have developed over time. It may be useful to split data into different triangle subsets if it is believed that losses from certain business segments or geographical regions could develop in significantly different ways from others. Losses from different states can show different development patterns due to differences in benefit laws and legal environments. It may also be worthwhile to build triangles by job type or class code. ####  ##### Loss development factors, or LDFs, are selected for each development period from the triangles. The first step is deciding if a program’s experience is fully credible or if it should be supplemented with industry development factors. The selection of tail development is especially critical, as it affects LDFs for all younger development periods. In addition, LDFs must be tailored to the specific needs and experience of each data set. If LDFs are limited to a retention that is different from the projected losses, it may not be appropriate to use those LDFs in the projection process. LDFs can be adjusted to various retentions, but theoretical increases or decreases may not be appropriate based on a program’s history. ####  ##### 3. Determining trends ####  ##### In addition to selecting LDFs, frequency and severity trends should also be reviewed. There is a common misconception that they are accounted for when developing losses. This is known as “the overlap fallacy.” Applying trend to claims data adjusts losses to a desired exposure period to account for nominal cost differences between years, while developing losses estimates the final costs of all claims — also referred to as ultimate losses. If a program’s data is considered credible enough to estimate trends and they are significantly different from the industry, it must be demonstrated to auditors that the utilized trends are appropriate. It is important to also recognize what type of trend is needed when dealing with severity, specifically whether inflationary trend should be included. In addition, exposure trends, as measured through payroll, should be accounted for and should consider any shift in class codes of workers. ####  ##### 4. Selection of methods ####  ##### Actuaries utilize multiple estimation methods when selecting ultimate losses for each accident/policy period. Some methods rely strictly on current claims values and the selected LDFs; others rely on historical claims averages and ignore how claims for a specific year have developed so far; and others weigh actual and theoretical experience together. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of how the various methods react to data and program changes is essential to selecting appropriate ultimates. There are also times when commonly accepted actuarial methods do not produce intuitive results. It is critical that the actuary step back from the methods and apply business sense, because any movement in ultimate losses affects the bottom line. Additionally, selected ultimate losses for prior years hold an extra level of importance because a prospective year’s loss estimate is typically based on historical experience. ####  ##### 5. Large losses ####  ##### Large losses are inevitable. Two key considerations are how much do current estimates include for possible future large losses, and how much impact do large losses have on future projections. It must be considered whether a large loss is an anomaly or an indicator of possible future large losses. In order to minimize fluctuation in reserve estimates that are due to large losses, selected ultimates should include some provision for potential large losses or additional incurred but not reported, or IBNR, costs. IBNR losses represent unreported losses and can arise from unreported claims, development on known claims, reopening of claims or claims in transit. The majority of workers compensation IBNR costs are for development on known and reopened claims. A conservative approach would hold a healthy amount of IBNR and slowly lower estimates over time if large losses do not occur as a year matures. For older years, the reporting of a large loss may result in a dollar-for-dollar increase in ultimates, because less IBNR is typically held for more mature years. If large losses are not expected to occur every year, estimates for each individual year may not need to hold enough protection against a large loss. Collectively, however, there should be enough IBNR to absorb some expected level of large losses without significantly raising ultimates in total. ####  ##### 6. Stability vs. responsiveness ####  ##### Selected LDFs, ultimates, severity and frequency trends, and other model assumptions all affect the level of stability when projecting workers compensation losses. Estimates for younger years are typically based on theoretical methods that are more stable compared with methods that rely heavily on actual claims experience. For example, if a large loss is reported within the first six months of a policy year, a method that relies solely on actual claims experience will assume continuing large development in the future and can potentially overestimate ultimate losses. A balance must be achieved between overreacting and reacting too slowly to new information. ####  ##### 7. Program changes ####  ##### Possible changes to a program may include size of retention, purchase or sale of a division, changes in claims handling and new loss initiatives. Adjustments for retention typically use increased limit factors, or ILFs, which can be based on an industry source or a program’s own data. Similar to limiting LDFs, theoretical increases or decreases based on industry experience may not be appropriate, and actuarial judgment must be exercised when selecting appropriate ILFs. Adjustments for the purchase or sale of a division are more complex and must be tailored for each scenario. Adjustments for changes in claims handling and new loss initiatives must also be tailored for each scenario. For example, a switch from using a third-party administrator to handling claims in-house may result in more focus being placed on gathering claims detail and closing claims more quickly. ####  ##### 8. Special considerations ####  ##### Changes to reserving methodology and timing of claims payments can have significant effects on the accuracy of LDFs and associated estimation methods. For example, if there is an increase in case reserve adequacy, ultimate losses will likely be overstated unless the necessary adjustments are made. Changes to employee mix — due to layoffs or changes in business — may also have a significant impact on the accuracy of estimation methods. An additional consideration includes any new initiatives to improve safety that will influence workers’ attitudes toward claims. ####  ##### 9. Issues specific to workers compensation ####  ##### Workers compensation benefits are highly dependent on state and jurisdiction. Prior claims must be adjusted for any new benefit laws put into place when projecting losses. Additions of new locations may also require adjustments to make sure prior claims are level with expected future losses, if the new locations fall within jurisdictions known to be different from current locations. ####  ##### Workers compensation exposures have very long tails. For example, a minor back injury today may require back surgery five years from now. An experienced actuary will factor in a provision for IBNR to protect against these late claims cost increases. ####  ##### 10. Financial reporting ####  ##### Although the long-tail nature of workers compensation adds complexity to projecting losses, it offers a great advantage for discounting liabilities from a financial perspective. Discount factors are based on a chosen interest rate and the estimated payment pattern from the selected LDFs. The discount rate is usually provided by the company, but an actuary would be able to provide guidance related to interest rates similar companies are using. An actuary would also be able to provide expertise in estimating liabilities at various probability levels above the actuarial central estimate using loss distributions for programs that are interested in evaluating different degrees of conservatism. ####  ##### Conclusion ####  ##### When projecting workers compensation losses, it is beneficial to have a strong understanding of the many pieces that affect results. If carried reserves are understated, accruals will be inadequate. If carried reserves are overstated, capital is tied up and unavailable for other strategic uses. It is always a best practice that management works closely with the actuary to fully understand the analysis and newlyfounded insights. ####  ##### Carly Rowland is a consulting actuary at Milliman Inc..

"Finding the right insurance coverage helps mitigate ransomware exposures ";"Opinion";"Cyber Risks";" ##### Ransomware has become frighteningly pervasive and increasingly serious — a reality punctuated by the massive global WannaCry cyber attack that recently affected tens of thousands of organizations across a wide range of industry sectors. ####  ##### Organizations can proactively manage ransomware risk through the adoption and implementation of robust cyber security and business continuity practices, and by training employees how to spot and avoid social engineering exploits, such as phishing emails. But there is no such thing as perfect cyber security, limits exist around what is feasible in terms of security and business continuity planning, and mistakes happen. Organizations must accept that they may face a ransomware attack. ####  ##### Insurance can play a vital role in a company’s overall strategy to address, mitigate and maximize protection against the losses and exposures relating to a ransomware attack. Importantly, virtually all standalone cyber insurance policies offer specific coverage for ransomware and other forms of cyber extortion, in addition to other standard coverages. ####  ##### Although cyber insurance can be extremely valuable, obtaining the right cyber insurance product presents significant challenges. There is no standardization among cyber insurance policies, notwithstanding that the associated marketing materials frequently make it seem as though the majority of policies available today are capable of an apples-to-apples comparison. This could hardly be further from reality. Cyber insurance policies vary dramatically. Although this creates challenges, it also creates opportunities. ####  ##### Owing in part of the lack of standardization, organizations can achieve significant negotiated enhancements to off-the-shelf cyber insurance forms that dramatically broaden the coverage. Many, if not the majority, of these enhancements involve no increase in premium. ####  ##### Organizations initially purchasing or renewing this type of coverage are well advised to engage the assistance of knowledgeable outside counsel at the outset to ensure that the appropriate insurance is in place when an attack occurs, and that coverage is maximized in the wake of an attack. ####  ##### Here are 10 tips for maximizing coverage for ransomware and other forms of cyber extortion. ####  ##### • Obtain a broad scope of coverage. Cyber extortion coverage should be written to cover as broad a range of potential threats as possible. The coverage should not be limited to ransomware, but should also cover the various other forms of cyber extortion potentially faced by the organization, including threats to obtain or release protected information — such as personally identifiable customer data, protected health information and confidential corporate information — or to discharge denial-of-service attacks that disrupt an organization’s networks, causing business interruption. By way of example, one recent off-the-shelf cyber policy extortion coverage grant promises to “reimburse Extortion Expenses incurred by an Insured in response to … an actual Network Extortion Threat,” which is defined to list specific types of attacks: “[A]ny credible threat or series of related threats directed at an Insured to: release, divulge, disseminate, destroy or use Protected Information or confidential corporate information of an Insured taken from an Insured as a result of the unauthorized access to or unauthorized use of an Insured’s Computer System or Shared Computer System; cause a Network Security Failure; alter, corrupt, damage, manipulate, misappropriate, delete or destroy Digital Data; or restrict or inhibit access to an Insured’s Computer System or Shared Computer System.” It is important to understand and negotiate the key definitions that define the scope of coverage to ensure that they are sufficiently broad to match the reality of risk faced by the insured organization. ####  ##### • Obtain a broad definition of covered loss. Covered loss should include reasonable and necessary expenses incurred as a result of a covered threat, including the costs of investigating and assessing a threat, even if no ransom is paid; payment of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin; any other consideration or action that may be demanded by the extortionists; and reasonable expenses incurred to mitigate or reduce other covered expenses. ####  ##### • Pay attention to conditions. Organizations are advised to pay close attention to policy conditions, including notice and consent provisions, proof of loss provisions, allocation provisions, alternative dispute resolution provisions and any requirements that the organization notify law enforcement of the incident at issue. ####  ##### • Beware of exclusions. Like any other insurance policy, a cyber policy may contain exclusions that may significantly curtail and undermine the purpose of the coverage. For example, some insurers insert exclusions based on purported shortcomings in the insured’s cyber security. Following one health care-related data breach, for example, CNA Financial Corp. filed coverage litigation against its insured, Cottage Health, seeking to avoid coverage based on an exclusion in the NetProtect360 policy at issue, entitled “Failure to Follow Minimum Required Practices.” Citing the exclusion, CNA alleged that coverage was barred because its insured failed to “continuously implement the procedures and risk controls identified in its application,” to “regularly check and maintain security patches on its systems” and to “enhance risk controls,” among a host of “other things.” These types of exclusions, which are sometimes included in other insurers’ policies, too, should be rejected. ####  ##### • Be aware of sublimits. Cyber extortion coverage may be written subject to a relatively low sublimit, such that, for example, a $10 million limit primary policy may provide only $250,000 or $500,000 for cyber extortion losses. As with the case of other cyber insurance terms and conditions, sublimits usually are negotiable, and should be sufficiently high to cover reasonably projected exposure. ####  ##### • Obtain a “discovery” trigger. Cyber extortion coverage should specify that the coverage is triggered by the insured’s “discovery” of a threat, rather than by the occurrence of an incident after a certain “retroactive date.” ####  ##### • WannaCry? Notify! Insurance policies typically contain notification provisions stating that the insured must provide notice “as soon as practicable” after it becomes aware of an incident. It is important to reasonably comply with notice provisions in order to not jeopardize coverage. It is important, moreover, for organizations to recognize that what begins as a relatively low cyber extortion demand may evolve into an incident, or series of related events, that triggers other coverage sections of the policy. Indeed, a ransom demand may be deployed as a purposeful diversion from a different, principal goal, such as stealing sensitive records. ####  ##### • Obtain “consent.” Cyber extortion coverage invariably will contain a “consent” provision, which will require the insured organization first obtain the insurer’s approval to pay or incur costs, including the payment of ransom. Toward the goal of obtaining coverage, it is important that the insured reasonably comply with these types of provisions. Policies may be negotiated to state that the insurer’s consent may “not be unreasonably withheld.” ####  ##### • Maximize coverage across the entire insurance program. Organizations are advised to consider all potentially applicable insurance coverages. A cyber extortion incident may trigger, for example, computer crime policies, kidnap and ransom policies and traditional property policies. The various policies that may be triggered by a cyber attack likely carry different limits, deductibles, retentions and other self-insurance features, together with various potentially conflicting provisions addressing other insurance, erosion of self-insurance and stacking of limits. It is important to carefully consider the best strategy for pursuing coverage in a manner that will most effectively and efficiently maximize the potentially available coverage across the insured’s entire insurance portfolio. ####  ##### • Don’t take “no” for an answer. Unfortunately, even where there is a legitimate claim for coverage under the policy language and applicable law, an insurer may deny an insured’s claim. Organizations that refuse to take “no” for an answer may be able to secure valuable coverage if they effectively pursue their claim. ####  ##### Roberta D.

"View from Washington: Insurers silent on climate";"Opinion";"";" ##### President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement last month — a decision I suspect the United States will quickly come to regret. ####  ##### The Paris agreement reaffirmed a goal of limiting the global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius and committed countries to develop plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and regularly report on their progress. The United States, under former President Barack Obama, was one of 195 countries signing on to the agreement. But President Trump’s decision to withdraw will allow countries such as China and India to further shape a global agreement that will dramatically impact the United States regardless of its lack of participation. ####  ##### The backlash to the president’s decision in much of the business community and at the state and local levels was swift and unmistakable. But there was a critical voice that was missing: the U.S. insurance sector. ####  ##### Perhaps it is a fear of offending customers who reject either the very idea of climate change or the fact that human behavior is a significant contributor to global warming that has kept domestic insurers, and even the trade associations that normally speak for them on political issues, mostly on the sidelines. ####  ##### But that silence works against them because they are abdicating an opportunity to play a constructive role in addressing a serious threat to their own profitability, as the natural catastrophes that they are financially responsible for will only get worse without timely intervention. ####  ##### Their European reinsurance counterparts are not nearly as skittish, with officials from Munich Reinsurance America Inc. and Swiss Re Ltd. denouncing the president’s decision to withdraw. They should be commended for their willingness to publicly oppose an action they know will keep the United States from being a critical player in addressing what their own research tells them is a real threat to human life and property. ####  ##### Insurers are going to have to deal with the climate issue some way or the other. California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones launched the Climate Risk Carbon Initiative in January 2016 to require insurers with $100 million in annual premiums doing business in California to disclose investments in fossil fuels and asked all insurers operating in the state to divest investments in thermal coal. He recently vowed to continue this initiative despite a threat of legal action by Republican officials in 13 states, predominantly those with major oil, gas and coal interests. As Mr. Jones stated in his response, there is overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is real and should not be ignored. ####  ##### The 2004 disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow” depicted the consequences of failing to heed warnings on climate change, including devastating catastrophes in areas of the United States where they are least expected. While the movie significantly exaggerates the time frame of these events for dramatic purposes, two key elements ring true: that human behavior is contributing to a changing climate and that those in power who can act to prevent catastrophic climate change often ignore the scientific warnings until it’s too late. ####  ##### President Trump has failed to heed these warnings. It’s time for others to step up. #### "
"No longer stuck in the weeds: Marijuana insurance moves into the mainstream";"Opinion";"";" ##### Medical marijuana is now legal in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Eight states and the District of Columbia now have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Recent polls indicate 61% of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized. ####  ##### In light of these legalizations and the new attitude, policyholders, agents and insurers have been reconsidering the insurability of marijuana-based industries in the United States. Today, the trend is to allow them to be insured. Many insurers see the marijuana industry as no different than any other. In fact, many insurers believe the risk posed by the marijuana industry is similar to the risk posed by the alcohol industry and believe that both should be insured in a similar manner. ####  ##### For many years, marijuana was illegal. Thus, simply put, any insurance of marijuana growing or selling operations was considered uninsurable because of policy provisions relating to illegal operations or the public policy against insuring illegal actions. Sometimes this public policy was expressed statutorily, in that a state law made it clear that an insured could have no insurable interest in a property if it was an illegal interest. As recently as 2012, case law expressed this in regard to marijuana. In Tracy v. USAA Casualty Insurance Co., heard in federal district court in Honolulu, Barbara Tracy had marijuana plants stolen from her property. She filed a claim with USAA, which denied her claim on the grounds that she lacked an insurable interest. USAA referred to the following Hawaii statute which stated: “No contract of insurance on property or of any interest therein or arising therefrom shall be enforceable except for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the property insured. Insurable interest means any lawful and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance free from loss, destruction or pecuniary damage.” ####  ##### USAA argued that since marijuana was illegal under federal law, marijuana plants could not be insured. The plants were not lawful, and there was no insurable interest. The insurer never mentioned state law. The court agreed, and denied Ms. Tracy recovery. But this was 2012, not 1962. The Tracy v. USAA case raised howls of protest. In response to the Tracy decision, in Oregon, where medical marijuana was legal, a statute was passed that specifically stated that no contract would be unenforceable on the basis that the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possessing or use of marijuana was prohibited by federal law. Washington, on the other hand, made marijuana legal. ####  ##### Here is the problem: if marijuana is lawful under state law then, at least under state law, it should be insurable. However, if marijuana is still classified as a banned controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, insurers could still use illegality as a defense. Still, it will be less likely today to be successful. ####  ##### The “Cole Memo” of 2013, which was issued by the Obama administration’s Justice Department led many to believe that federal marijuana laws would not be enforced in states that had legalized marijuana use. The memo hinted that as long as these states took steps to regulate possession, prohibit trafficking across state lines and keep marijuana away from minors, the federal government would leave marijuana alone. In effect, marijuana was legal on the federal level. That would seem to cure all problems regarding insurability. Now, however, a new administration has threatened enforcement of federal drug laws concerning marijuana. While it remains to be seen whether this enforcement will be carried out, could this once again change the game? ####  ##### Probably not for insurance industry purposes because many agents and brokers are now insuring risks with full knowledge that they are insuring the marijuana industry. This waives any illegality defense. The 2016 The Green Earth Wellness Center L.L.C. v. Atain Specialty Insurance Co. case in a federal district court in Denver addresses this issue. Green Earth operated a retail medical marijuana dispensary and a growing facility. A wildfire damaged its operation. The insurer sought to deny coverage on many grounds, one of which was that the policy was void on public policy grounds because the subject of the risk was illegal marijuana. The court disagreed, stating that the insurer knew what the risk involved when it entered into the policy. ####  ##### Moreover, it appears that no state insurance regulatory authority has prohibited issuing insurance to the marijuana industry. It appears that most American insurers now indeed do so. There is a notable holdout: Lloyd’s of London has instructed its syndicates to not write the industry because marijuana is still listed as a scheduled drug under federal law. This is a minority position and is likely to change. ####  ##### Regarding first-party coverage, it appears that marijuana industries are being insured under the same forms as any other industry. There are some unique aspects, however — not as to the forms, but regarding the business. The “grow” operation is intense, needing ventilation controls, irrigation systems and special lamps. Damage to these systems can be costly. It has been suggested that since marijuana is a lucrative business that business interruption limits be kept at a high level because the potential for lost profits is great. Since marijuana is highly desirable, the risk of theft will be high, leading to a need for theft insurance with increased limits. Moreover, large amounts of cash are usually on hand at marijuana dispensaries, leading to a greater risk of robbery and more expensive coverage. ####  ##### Commercial general liability insurance will also be needed and, as stated, will be directly comparable to CGL policies obtained by the alcohol industry. A major risk would be dram shop liability cases. No state has yet imputed vicarious liability to a marijuana business for an injury caused by a person to whom the business sold marijuana. However, there seems to be no logical reason why an attempt to impose this type of liability will not occur. Failure-to-warn claims will also probably occur, alleging a business failed to communicate the hazards of marijuana to a purchaser or end user. One particular area to be examined is whether there can be coverage for any raid and seizure conducted by the federal government in a location where marijuana is legal under state law but where the federal government is enforcing federal law. To date, this has not been the subject of a claim, but new enforcement actions could bring this about. ####  ##### Inland marine insurance is one area where special forms are arising. The transport of marijuana is highly regulated. Once again, the highly lucrative nature of the product being transported makes its carriers a tempting target. There are now specialized clauses insuring cannabis transport, requiring strict security procedures, such as transport of cannabis only in armored vehicles, two drivers in vehicles at all times and strict criminal background checks for all drivers.

"United Continental to issue first note to PBGC for pension takeover";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, P/C Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### CHICAGO—United Continental Holdings Inc. says it will issue a $62.5 million note to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the first payment the holding company has made as part of a 2005 agreement to have the PBGC to take over four underfunded United Airlines' pension plans. ####  ##### Under the agreement, United, which merged last year with Continental Airlines, is required to issue a $62.5 million note whenever EBITDAR—or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent—exceeds $3.5 billion over a 12-month period. United Continental said Thursday that a triggering event occurred as of June 30. ####  ##### The airline will be required to furnish the note, which carries an 8% interest rate, by Feb. 14, 2012. Interest will be paid twice a year. The note expires on June 30, 2026, though United Continental can call in the note at any time at par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ####  ##### Under the 2005 agreement, United Continental is liable to issue the $62.5 million note in any year that the EBITDAR trigger is hit through 2017.  That could require the airline to issue up to $500 million in notes. ####  ##### Largest PBGC loss ever ####  ##### The PBGC’s takeover of the four United plans with more than 121,000 participants resulted in a $6.6 billion loss, the largest loss incurred by the agency since it was established in 1974 as part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ####  ##### In fiscal 2010, the PBGC reported a near-record $23 billion deficit in its insurance programs, which are used to guarantee benefits in plans the agency takes over from failed companies, or from employers so financially distressed that they no longer can afford to fund their pension plans. ####  ##### The failure of the United plans and the massive loss incurred by the PBGC was a key factor that led Congress the following year to pass legislation tightening pension funding rules as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. #### "
"Express buy of Medco rouses consumer foes ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Prescription Drug Benefits, Regulation, Express Scripts, Mergers & Acquisitions";" ##### WASHINGTON (Reuters)—Express Scripts Inc.’s planned buy of Medco Health Solutions Inc. met with swift opposition from consumer advocates and drug stores, signaling the beginning of what could be an ugly fight for antitrust approval. ####  ##### The $29.1 billion deal would create a powerhouse in managing prescription drug benefits. Its only other real competitor would be CVS Caremark Corp., at No. 2, and possibly UnitedHealth Group. ####  ##### “This is an area where there is already tremendous concentration,” said Sharon Treat, executive director of the National Legislative Assn. on Prescription Drug Prices. “If you look at who has all the (pharmacy benefits ) contracts, it’s going to be concentrated on the Big 3 which would now be the Big 2.” ####  ##### Ms. Treat believes the combination will raise prices for consumers at the drugstore due to the lack of competition. ####  ##### Antitrust regulators tend to look skeptically at deals which reduce the number of competitors in an industry from four to three, and take an even harder look at deals that reduce the number of competitors to two. ####  ##### Community pharmacy groups were already consulting with the Federal Trade Commission and state prosecutors on their next steps in opposing the deal, the National Community Pharmacists Assn. and National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores said in a joint statement. ####  ##### “The major (pharmacy benefits managers) already wield an unchecked, one-sided advantage in setting contract and reimbursement terms for community pharmacists, undermining their viability to continue serving patients,” said Douglas Hoey, NCPA head, in an emailed statement. “Approval of this merger would further distort this marketplace, to the detriment of patients, true competition and lower prices,” he said. ####  ##### Like merging Visa, Mastercard? ####  ##### The review itself will take considerably longer than the four months that the FTC took to approve pharmacy giant CVS’s purchase of Caremark, which closed in 2007, said an antitrust expert who asked not to be named. ####  ##### Antitrust regulators could well take a hard look at how many options big companies have when they look for a pharmacy benefits contractor, said this expert. ####  ##### “The question is how many alternatives do large companies have?” this person asked. “When a large company goes out to bid its (drug) plan, how many options do they have?” ####  ##### The FTC is already investigating CVS Caremark after allegations that it has used its pharmacy benefits business to steer customers to CVS pharmacies rather than allowing customers to go where they choose. ####  ##### The three companies’—CVS, Express and Medco—share of the large-plan market could well be 80%, said David Balto, a former FTC policy director now in private practice. ####  ##### “This is terrible for consumers. This is like Visa and MasterCard merging,” he said. ####  ##### Analysts said approval was a gamble, while noting that sophisticated corporations only rarely announce major deals that they cannot shepherd through to approval. ####  ##### “The companies I’m sure have investigated this and they think that they have a decent shot of it, although it’s notable that there’s no financial penalties in the deal if it doesn’t get approved by regulators,” said Morningstar analyst Matthew Coffina. “They’re just making a bet at this point that regulators will go along with it.” #### "
"Harry & David can terminate pension plan: Bankruptcy court";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### WILMINGTON, Del.—A federal bankruptcy judge gave permission Monday to Harry & David Holdings Inc. to terminate a pension plan with 2,700 participants. ####  ##### Under U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Mary Walrath's ruling, the Medford, Ore.-based gourmet gift manufacturer can terminate the plan after it emerges from bankruptcy. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. estimates that the plan has $33.4 million in unfunded benefits, nearly all of which the PBGC would guarantee if the plan is terminated. ####  ##### The PBGC opposed the termination, saying the company could afford to continue the plan, although it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year. ####  ##### The PBGC, which reported a near-record $23 billion deficit in fiscal 2010, said it is reviewing Judge Walrath's ruling and will decide whether to appeal. #### "

As of Dec. 2, more than $4.5 billion—up from $4.1 billion as of Nov. 3, has been distributed. ####  ##### “CMS is exercising its authority…to deny certain reimbursement requests based on the available amount remaining of the $5 billion in appropriated program funding and the rate it is being disbursed,” the agency said. ####  ##### The announcement had been expected, with benefits observers saying they doubted that funds would be available to pay claims incurred after the end of 2011. ####  ##### “As we have been anticipating the past few months, the ERRP funds will largely or completely be gone before the end of 2011,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants L.L.C. in Secaucus, N.J. ####  ##### Under the ERRP, the federal government reimburses plan sponsors for a portion of claims incurred starting June 1, 2010, by retirees who are at least age 55 but not eligible for Medicare, as well as covered dependents, regardless of age. ####  ##### After a participant incurs $15,000 in health care claims in a plan year, the government will reimburse 80% of claims, up to $90,000. ####  ##### Of the total paid out so far, $387.2 million was distributed to the United Auto Workers Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. The trust is a voluntary employees' beneficiary association set up by the UAW under a 2007 collective bargaining agreement between General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler L.L.C. and the UAW. ####  ##### Under that agreement, the automakers agreed to contribute more than $50 billion to the VEBA. In return, the automakers no longer have to provide health care benefits to UAW-represented retirees and their dependents. The UAW is responsible for managing the VEBA and paying retiree health care claims. ####  ##### Other big recipients of ERRP funds and the payments they have received through Dec. 2, include: ####  ##### • AT&T Inc., $213.8 million; ####  ##### • Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, $180.1 million; ####  ##### • Verizon Communications Inc., $163.0 million; and ####  ##### • California Public Employees' Retirement System, $131.4 million. #### "
"Via Christi Health asks ok to use captive to fund benefit risks";"Benefits Management";"Alternative Risk Transfer/Captives, Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### WASHINGTON—Via Christi Health Inc., a Wichita, Kan.-based health care system, is asking the Labor Department for permission to use the U.S. Virgin Islands branch of its Cayman Island captive insurance company to fund life insurance risks. ####  ##### Under the proposal, the policies would be written by Minnesota Life Insurance Co., which would reinsure the risk through the Virgin Islands branch. The branch was established in September to reinsure Via Christi employee benefit risks. ####  ##### Via Christi, which says it is the largest provider of health care services in Kansas, fully or partially owns or manages 12 hospitals in the state. It generated $1.09 billion in operating revenues in fiscal 2010. ####  ##### Via Christi's application comes in the wake of a spurt of activity in the captive employee benefits funding arena. ####  ##### Last month, Google Inc. filed an application with the Labor Department for approval to fund benefit risks through its Hawaii captive insurer, and in October Microsoft Corp. sought permission to use the Vermont branch of its Bermuda captive to reinsure life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment policies. Microsoft already uses the Vermont branch to reinsure long-term disability coverage. ####  ##### And last week, the Labor Department gave final authorization to Dow Corning Corp. to fund basic life insurance risks through its Washington-based captive. In 2009, the Labor Department gave Dow Corning permission to fund certain other types of life insurance coverage through the captive. #### "
"401(k) plan participation could fall victim to proposed health care affordability test";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Retirement Benefits";" ##### WASHINGTON—Without modification, a proposed Internal Revenue Service health care reform law affordability test could encourage some employers to drop programs intended to encourage employee participation in 401(k) plans, a benefits trade group says. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014, employers are liable for an annual $3,000-per-employee penalty for employees whose required health insurance premium contribution for single coverage exceeds 9.5% of family income and the employees are eligible for federal premium subsidies to buy coverage through state insurance exchanges. ####  ##### In September, the IRS asked for public comment on a proposed safe harbor in which coverage would be considered affordable as long as the premium contribution for single coverage did not exceed 9.5% of an employee's W-2 wages. ####  ##### But in a letter sent Tuesday to the IRS, the American Benefits Council said using wages, as reported in Box 1 of the W-2 wage and income statement, to determine if the required premium contribution is affordable “seems to create a possible disincentive for employers regarding programs and features designed to increase employee participation” in 401(k) plans. ####  ##### That's because Box 1 wages are reduced by the amount of an employee's pretax contributions to a 401(k) plan, the Washington-based ABC said in its letter. ####  ##### “Thus, for example, someone who defers amounts into a 401(k) plan will have lower wages reported in Box 1 of the Form W-2 and, as a result, his or her employer-provided coverage…is more likely to be unaffordable when compared to another employee that makes fewer or no elective deferrals,” ABC said in its letter. ####  ##### Given the increased likelihood of failing the affordability test and being hit with stiff financial penalties, employers might pull back on programs, like automatic enrollment, that lead to increased employee participation in 401(k) plans, the group added. ####  ##### A simple remedy to the problem, ABC suggested to Treasury Department regulators, would be—for the purpose of satisfying the W-2 health care premium affordability test—to allow employers to count employees' pretax benefit plan contributions as wages. #### "

"PBGC faces $17 billion in liabilities if AA terminates plans";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation";" ##### FORT WORTH, Texas—If American Airlines Inc. terminates its four hugely underfunded pension plans, the responsibility for paying billions of dollars in benefits to plan participants will shift from the airline to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. ####  ##### This year, American Airlines estimates plan participants will receive just over $600 million in benefits if it doesn't terminate its pension plans. Benefit payments would increase to $678 million in 2013 and $738 million in 2014, according to a 2010 10-K report—the latest available—filed by parent company AMR Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas. ####  ##### From 2015 through 2019, plan participants would receive $4.63 billion in payments from the airline's plans. ####  ##### If the plans are terminated, the PBGC would be responsible for paying the bulk of those promised benefits. ####  ##### The PBGC says that according to its preliminary estimates, it would be liable for a total of about $17 billion in benefits earned by American Airlines employees, retirees and dependents. ####  ##### The PBGC does not have a breakout of the benefit payments it would have to make over the next seven years. ####  ##### The PBGC, though, would not be liable for all pension benefits earned by the airline's employees and retirees. The maximum annual benefit—payable at age 65—guaranteed by the PBGC is $54,000 for plans that terminated in 2011, and nearly $56,000 for plans terminating this year. ####  ##### Some veteran American Airlines pilots, for example, have earned bigger benefits, which they would lose if the plans are terminated. #### "

Once Mr. Roberts becomes president of Caremark in September, Mr. Lofberg will focus on areas such as new business development and client relationships and retention, essentially serving as a chairman of the unit. Mr. Lofberg will still report to CEO Larry Merlo. ####  ##### Mr. Roberts, 56, is a pharmacist by training and has been with CVS for 21 years. He became COO of the Caremark business in 2010 after holding positions in both pharmacy and retail areas. ####  ##### The news came just days after PBM rival Express Scripts Inc. said it could close its $29 billion acquisition of Medco Health Solutions Inc. as soon as next week. Pharmacy groups and several small pharmacy chains filed a lawsuit on Thursday arguing that the proposed merger should be stopped because it would hurt such businesses. ####  ##### Before Mr. Lofberg joined CVS, his career in the PBM industry included serving as chairman of Merck-Medco Managed Care L.L.C., which later became Medco Health Solutions. #### "

"Law will cut defined benefit pension contributions, but increase PBGC premiums ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management";" ##### WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama has signed into law legislation that will allow employers to slash their defined benefit plan contributions by billions of dollars throughout the next several years, but it also boosts their pension insurance premiums. ####  ##### The pension-related provisions were included as part of a broader transportation funding bill, H.R. 4348, that President Obama signed Friday. ####  ##### Under the new law, employers can use higher interest rates to value plan liabilities, thus reducing the value of the liabilities and the contributions they must make to the plans. ####  ##### Employers will continue to value plan liabilities based on interest rates on top-rated corporate bonds for three different segments, averaged over 24 months. Segments refer to when benefits are paid to participants. ####  ##### Under this methodology, interest rates that value plan liabilities are based on the maturity date of the corporate bonds. For example, interest rates on pension liabilities to be paid within the next five years will be based on corporate bonds maturing within five years. ####  ##### Over the next decade, the interest rate changes will boost federal tax revenues by more than $9.4 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.  That is because using higher interest rates will decrease the value of plan liabilities, reducing required tax-deductible plan contributions, which in turn will increase employers' taxable incomes. ####  ##### However, the actual interest rate for each segment in 2012 would have to be within 10% of the average of those segment rates for the preceding 25-year period. In succeeding years, this 10% corridor would increase and top out at 30% in 2016. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Due to this change in methodology, the interest rate used to value benefits paid over the next five years will increase roughly three percentage points, with smaller, though still significant, percentage increases for benefits paid beyond five years, experts say. ####  ##### However, the new law also increases premiums that employers pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which has a $26 billion deficit in its insurance programs that guarantee most vested benefits to participants in plans the agency takes over from financially troubled employers. ####  ##### All employers with defined benefit plans pay an annual PBGC premium of $35 per plan participant. The new law will raise the premium to $42 in 2013 and to $49 in 2014. ####  ##### In addition, the law increases the variable rate premium that is assessed on employers with underfunded plans. ####  ##### Under the law, the current variable rate premium of $9 per $1,000 of plan underfunding will be indexed to wage inflation starting next year. In addition, the premium will automatically increase by $4 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2014 and by $5 per $1,000 of plan underfunding in 2015. ####  ##### However, regardless of the amount of the underfunding, the maximum variable rate premium cannot exceed $400 per participant. ####  ##### PBGC Director Joshua Gotbaum preferred a different approach. In a statement this month, he said the agency would have preferred if Congress gave the PBGC would have been given authority to set premiums based on an employer's creditworthiness. #### "

Co. disclosed Wednesday that it expects to cut its 2012 defined benefit pension plan and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions by $46 million, primarily due to the impact of legislation Congress approved last month that will allow employers to use higher interest rate assumptions in valuing plan liabilities. ####  ##### In a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Donnelley said it expects to make total pension and 401(k) plan contributions of $205 million in 2012, a $46 million reduction from prior estimates. That reduction, Donnelley said, was driven by the pension funding relief provisions included in a broader highway bill signed by President Barack Obama. ####  ##### In 2013, Donnelly expects to make about $110 million in pension and 401(k) plan contributions. ####  ##### Last year, the company froze accruals in its defined benefit program, attributing its decision to the volatility of market returns and interest rates on the plans’ funding requirements. #### "

""Preserving a defined benefit pension plan at a company in the midst of bankruptcy reorganization is the best possible outcome under extremely difficult circumstances."" ####  ##### If ratified by members, the contract change would still require approval by the bankruptcy judge. Voting is scheduled for Friday after a meeting to discuss the changes. ####  ##### The sale of the Witchita, Kan.-based aircraft maker to the Chinese firm would pre-empt a full-blown debt restructuring. ####  ##### Hawker is seeking to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection which it entered in May when it was unable to support a $2.5 billion debt load. ####  ##### Union spokesman Frank Larkin said the machinists group remained concerned about the possible loss of jobs and technologies if the takeover by the Chinese company proceeds. #### "

"PBGC backs plan for no lump-sum pension payments to American pilots";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. disclosed Friday that it supports American Airlines Inc. parent AMR Corp.'s request to a federal bankruptcy court for permission to allow the airline to amend its frozen pilots' pension plan so that retiring pilots cannot receive their accrued benefits as a lump sum. ####  ##### The PBGC said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that elimination of the lump-sum option is necessary to avoid a distress plan termination before AMR emerges from bankruptcy and a huge loss to the PBGC. ####  ##### The bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on AMR's proposal. ####  ##### In its filing, the PBGC, which reported a record $29.1 billion deficit in fiscal 2012 in its insurance program for single-employer plans, said it would incur a $2.3 billion loss if it took over the American pilots' plan. ####  ##### In a previous filing with the bankruptcy court, AMR warned that the availability of the lump-sum option would lead to mass retirements of pilots. ####  ##### Under one scenario outlined by AMR, a 50-year-old pilot, for example, “may conclude that he or she can have the best of both worlds by retiring from American with a substantial lump sum while continuing to fly the most prestigious aircraft at a top salary for a foreign airline.” ####  ##### A surge in retirements “would create a pilot shortage which, in turn, would result in an operational crisis involving the wholesale cancellation of flights and the grounding of airplanes, with a corresponding devastating reduction in revenue and profitability,” AMR said in its filing. ####  ##### To prevent that from happening, American would be forced to seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate the plan, AMR said. That would shift liability to pay the plan's promised but unfunded benefits from American to the PBGC. #### "
"Mass. Connector Authority head to lead state's finance office ";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Regulation";" ##### Glen Shor, the executive director of Massachusetts' Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, will leave in early January to become secretary of the state's Executive Office of Administration and Finance, a cabinet-level position. ####  ##### The Connector Authority is the Massachusetts agency responsible for administering key parts of the state's landmark 2006 health care reform law. ####  ##### Mr. Shor assumed his position at the Connector Authority in June 2010, when he succeeded Jon Kingsdale, the authority's first executive director. Jean Yang, the Connector Authority's chief financial officer, will replace Mr. Shor. ####  ##### The Connector Authority administers two state health insurance exchanges:  Commonwealth Care, which provides state-subsidized coverage to 198,000 lower-income state residents; and Commonwealth Choice, which provides access to coverage for residents not eligible for employer coverage. While the state does not subsidize the premiums for coverage in Commonwealth Choice, which has about 43,000 enrollees, the premiums charged often are substantially lower than those in the nongroup market. ####  ##### Those programs have helped Massachusetts achieve the lowest uninsured rate — 3.4% in 2011 — of any state, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. ####  ##### The changes were announced Thursday by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. #### "
"Verizon completes annuity purchase to transfer pension plan obligations";"Benefits Management";"Retirement Benefits";" ##### Verizon Communications Inc. disclosed Monday that it has completed its purchase of a giant group annuity to transfer about $7.5 billion in pension plan obligations to Prudential Insurance Co. of America. ####  ##### The arrangement covers about 41,000 management participants who retired and began receiving pension benefits before Jan. 1, 2010. Verizon contributed about $2.6 billion to the plan in connection to the transaction, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ####  ##### “The transaction is expected to further Verizon's objective of de-risking the pension plan while improving the company's longer-term financial profile,” New York-based Verizon said. ####  ##### Verizon's move came after that of General Motors Co., which purchased a group annuity — also from Prudential — to cover the benefits of tens of thousands of participants in its pension plan for salaried employees. ####  ##### More employers are expected to follow the paths blazed by GM and Verizon, experts say. Through purchasing an annuity and transferring the benefit obligations to an insurer, employers will save on costs such as premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., as well as fees and costs associated with offering and administering their pension plans. ####  ##### In addition, employers taking such actions no longer will be exposed to fluctuating interest rates and investment results, which can cause major changes in their pension plans costs and contributions. #### "

"HHS rejects Mississippi's state insurance exchange application";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### (Reuters) — Mississippi on Friday became the first state to have its proposal for a health insurance exchange rejected by the U.S. government, and federal officials said Republican Gov. Phil Bryant's opposition to the plan was to blame. ####  ##### ""With a lack of support from your governor and no formal commitment to coordinate from other state agencies, we do not see a feasible pathway to conditionally approving a state-based exchange in Mississippi for 2014,"" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a letter to the state. ####  ##### Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, a Republican, had waged a bitter battle with Gov. Bryant and other fellow party leaders in his state over implementing a state-run health insurance exchange. ####  ##### The exchanges are a central provision of Democratic President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under the law, all states must have fully operational health insurance exchanges by Jan. 1, 2014. ####  ##### Gov. Bryant opposes a state-run system, saying it opens the door to the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to by critics as ""Obamacare."" The governor has said it will shackle the state with debt related to inflated Medicaid rolls. ####  ##### Mr. Chaney also opposes the federal health care reform law. But he has argued a state-run system would let Mississippi control its own insurance market, saving thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in the long run. ####  ##### The commissioner has been working on the exchange for years and became a resource for other states trying to devise their own plans. Mississippi submitted its proposal to the federal government in November. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Mr. Chaney's office said it would have further comment on the matter later on Friday. ####  ##### An exchange allows consumers to compare plans provided by health care providers in an effort to make them more transparent and get more people enrolled. If states fail to implement their own exchanges, the federal government will do it for them. ####  ##### Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have received conditional approval to establish their own state exchanges. ####  ##### States have the choice of rejecting the exchange provision outright, or following Delaware and Arkansas by participating in federal partnership exchanges that would allow them to manage insurance plans and aid consumers. ####  ##### The deadline for states to declare their intentions to run federal partnership exchanges is Feb. 15. The Health and Human Services Department said on Friday that it considered Mississippi ""an excellent candidate"" for that model. #### "
"Funded levels of GM pension plans up, size of plans down";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### The funded levels of General Motors Co.'s U.S. pension plans inched up in 2012, while the size of plans dropped amid the implementation of GM's trailblazing “de-risking” strategy. ####  ##### At year-end 2012, the plans were underfunded by $13.1 billion, down from $13.3 billion at year-end 2011, the big automaker reported Thursday. The plans' funding level, though, slipped to 84%, down from 88% at year-end 2011. ####  ##### The size of the GM plans was dramatically smaller compared to 2011. At year-end 2012, the plans had $81.2 billion in liabilities and $68.1 billion in assets. A year earlier, the plans had $107.7 billion in liabilities and $94.3 billion in assets. ####  ##### That $26.5 billion reduction in liabilities was the result of twin actions GM took in 2012 to reduce pension plan size. One of those steps was an offer GM made to 44,000 salaried employees who retired after Oct. 1, 1997, and before Dec. 1, 2011, to convert their monthly annuities to a cash lump sum payment. In all, about 13,000 accepted the offer. ####  ##### In addition, as the second part of its pension de-risking strategy, GM purchased a group annuity from Prudential Insurance Co. of America. ####  ##### The Prudential annuity replaced benefits that salaried employees who retired before Oct. 1, 1997, received from GM, as well as retirees who declined the lump sum conversion offer. ####  ##### GM has said the twin de-risking approaches dramatically reduced the size of its salaried U.S. pension plan. On Jan. 1, 2012, the plan had $35.9 billion in benefit obligations and $33.3 billion in assets. In early November, GM reported that salaried plan obligations had fallen to $9.2 billion and assets to $6.1 billion. #### "
"GOP lawmakers back Hobby Lobby contraception suit";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits";" ##### Eleven Republican lawmakers have signed an amicus brief that challenges the Obama administration's contraception coverage mandate by arguing the policy violates religious freedom. ####  ##### The brief, filed Tuesday with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, is part of a lawsuit filed by Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., a chain of Christian-owned craft retailers based in Oklahoma. The store's owners argue that the mandate, which requires employers to provide insurance that covers contraception at no out-of-pocket cost to enrollees, violates their religious principles and is unconstitutional. Hobby Lobby's suit was filed against HHS and Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ####  ##### “Congress has commanded equal treatment of all under a religion-protective rule,” the brief read. “Defendants may not pick and choose whose exercise of religion is protected and whose is not.” ####  ##### Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Dan Coats, R-Ind., Thad Cochran, R-Miss., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Jim Inhofe, (R-Okla., Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Richard Shelby, R-Ala., signed the brief, as well as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and  Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Frank Wolf, R-Va. ####  ##### The lawmakers are citing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. ####  ##### “Religious freedom is an issue our country was founded on, and it's not a Democrat or Republican issue,” Sen. Hatch said in a news release. ####  ##### “Unfortunately, the Obama administration has time and again ignored calls to stop the implementation of a policy some organizations or businesses are morally opposed to.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Catholic health providers made a similar argument when HHS unveiled its contraception mandate. Last May three Catholic health systems joined other Catholic groups in filing 12 federal lawsuits questioning the law, which went into effect earlier this year. ####  ##### The Catholic Health Association declined comment on the brief. The CHA supported the ACA, but disagreed with the mandate as written and asked HHS to reconsider the policy. Last week, the CHA issued a statement on a revised mandate that once again expressed concerns over how the government defined a religious employer and what groups would be exempt from the mandate. They called the revisions “substantial progress,” but cautioned more work was needed. ####  ##### Ashok Selvam writes for Modern Healthcare, a sister publication of Business Insurance. #### "
"Communications vital when changing retiree medical plan structures";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### NEW YORK — Employers planning to transition their group retiree medical benefit plans to individually purchased exchange-based models must carefully consider how the change in benefit structures will be communicated to current and future retirees, benefit managers say. ####  ##### During a panel discussion on Thursday at the 2013 Employee Health Care Conference in New York, benefit managers for Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer A.G. and Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle A.S. outlined the processes by which their separate companies exited their employer-sponsored group retiree health plans in favor of coverages purchased through private exchanges. ####  ##### At both companies, panelists said clear and consistent communication strategies encompassing current and future retirees — as well as senior corporate leadership — were vital to the success of their shifts to the individual markets. ####  ##### “As we were implementing this, the communication portion was really a key part of the strategy for us,” said Mike Holian, Nestle's Cleveland-based vice president of employee financial shared services. “The senior management was really anxious about disrupting our retiree population.” ####  ##### Beginning in January, Nestle shifted its U.S.-based Medicare-eligible retirees to an employer group waiver plan, or EGWP, with a wraparound secondary plan for pharmaceutical benefits, while its pre-65 and future retirees were transitioned to individual plans purchased through private exchanges operated by New York-based Towers Watson & Co. and its recently-purchased exchange service provider, San Mateo, Calif.-based Extend Health Inc. ####  ##### During the planning phases of the change-over, Mr. Holian said his team was instructed to devise a post-employment benefits solution that, above all, would not adversely impact the company's retirees, balancing the affordability and sustainability of the program, as well as capitalizing on efficiencies available in the marketplace and, where possible, using third-party funding to reduce costs for Nestle and its employees. ####  ##### “There was a fair amount of complexity involved in getting buy-in to all the changes that we were trying to make,” Mr. Holian said. “The primary goal here was really not about savings, but instead about how we could make this plan better for the retirees going forward in a way that was sustainable.” ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Similarly, Bayer migrated most of its current and future U.S. retiree population — including most nonunion Medicare retirees — into individual defined-contribution plans purchased through the Extend Health exchange. ####  ##### The company used savings earned from the termination of its group retiree medical plans and its retiree life insurance program to fund an increase to its 401(k) matching contributions and to establish a retiree medical savings account program for employees hired after Jan. 1, 2005, who are not eligible for the defined contribution for medical benefits. ####  ##### “When we communicated all of these changes, we centered those communications on the idea of retirement security,” said Lori Lechner, Bayer's Pittsburgh-based director of benefits planning. “I feel strongly that what we did was move an unprotected benefit to a protected benefit. That was an important message for us to communicate to the employees.” ####  ##### All told, Ms. Lechner said Bayer migrated nearly 7,300 retirees — about 93% of the company’s total U.S. retiree population — and their spouses into its exchange-based plans for the 2013 plan year. More importantly, she said, the company was able to successfully contact and inform 99% of its retiree population about the changes to their medical benefits. ####  ##### “We had a lot of printed material and hosted at least 27 on-site retiree meetings, and encouraged them to set up a one-on-one appointment with Extend Health’s benefit advisors,” Ms. Lechner said. “We sent out several reminder notices as well, because we really didn’t want any retiree feeling like they were left behind.” ####  ##### As was the case at Nestle, Ms. Lechner said securing executive-level support for the transition plan was at times challenging but ultimately crucial to its success. ####  ##### “It was really important to us to make sure that our senior leadership and (human resources) managers understood what we were doing, and understood that they may get questions from employees and retirees or comments that people weren’t happy with the change,” Ms. Lechner said. “A decision like this will always result in noise, but they had to understand that this was something that we felt was the right thing to do.” #### "

"Model notices for health insurance exchange notification released";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Health Care Benefits";" ##### Federal regulators on Wednesday released model notices that employers can provide to employees to satisfy a federal health care reform law requirement that employees be notified about the availability of public health insurance exchanges. ####  ##### Among other things, the notices from the U.S. Department of Labor  — one for employers who offer a health plan to some or all employees, and one for employers who do not offer a health plan — explain how exchanges will operate, and that certain conditions will have to be satisfied for employees to obtain federal premium subsidies to purchase exchange-provided coverage. ####  ##### Much to the relief of employers, they will not have to provide contact information for the exchanges. Instead, they can give a link in the notice to a Department of Health and Human Services website, www.healthcare.gov, that has such information. ####  ##### “That is very good news,” said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants L.L.C. in Secaucus, N.J. Employers had been concerned about the possibility that they would have had to provide contact information for all 50 public exchanges. ####  ##### Employers must distribute the notices, which are available at www.dol.gov/ebsa, prior to Oct. 1, 2013. Exchange policies will be effective Jan. 1, 2014. #### "

That plan has been closed to new employees since Jan. 1, 2008. ####  ##### In addition, a Rogers plan covering union employees will be frozen effective Dec. 31, a freeze that union employees ratified last month. ####  ##### Rogers said in a statement that it is “making changes to its retirement plans in order to better plan and manage related expenses, which can have a significant and variable impact on earnings.” ####  ##### Rogers said will it will beef up contributions to its 401(k) plan covering salaried and other nonunion employees effective June 30, and start matching contributions to its 401(k) plan covering union employees effective Jan. 1, 2014. ####  ##### As of Dec. 31, 2012, Rogers' pension plans were significantly underfunded, with $209.9 million in benefit obligations and $143.5 million in assets, according to its 2012 annual report. #### "
"More employers offer contraceptive, same-sex benefits: SHRM study";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Legislation & Regulation, Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits, Prescription Drug Benefits";" ##### The percentage of employers that cover contraceptives in their group health benefit plans has risen more than 16 percentage points in the past five years, according to a report by the Society for Human Resource Management. ####  ##### Eighty-two percent of employers surveyed in Alexandria, Va.-based SHRM's 2013 Employee Benefits Report indicated they cover contraceptives under their group health plan, up from 73% in 2012 and 66% in 2009. ####  ##### Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, most employers with more than 50 full-time employees — and/or their insurers — are required to provide cost-free coverage for contraceptive prescriptions and other women's preventative care services. ####  ##### Small employers with fewer than 50 full-time workers that do not offer employee health benefits, as well as certain types of religious employers, are exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirements. ####  ##### The controversial provision has been challenged in federal courts by as many as 32 for-profit companies and 30 nonprofit organizations, according to the Washington-based Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. In most cases, the plaintiffs allege the requirement violates their rights to religious expression under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment. ####  ##### To date, federal courts have granted preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the requirement to 20 for-profit employers pending the outcome of their lawsuits. Another seven employers have been denied injunctions, according to the Beckett Fund. ####  ##### SHRM's study also noted a slight rise in the percentage of employers offering health care coverage and other benefits to employees' same-sex domestic partners. ####  ##### %%BREAK%% ####  ##### Thirty-seven percent of employers polled in the 2013 study provide health care coverage for same-sex domestic partners, up from 35% in 2012. ####  ##### The study noted a much steeper rise in the percentage of employers offering nonhealth benefits to same-sex domestic partners, including wellness, paid leave, retirement savings and planning, financial and compensation, and professional and career development benefits. Twenty-four percent of employers in 2013 said they provide employees' same-sex domestic partners with nonhealth benefits, up from 15% in 2012. ####  ##### Several other specific health-related benefits have seen significant increases in popularity among employers since 2009, the study noted. The percentages of employers offering mental health coverage, supplemental accident insurance, health savings accounts, coverage for corrective laser eye surgery, acupuncture and elective procedures have all grown five to 10 percentage points in the past five years. ####  ##### As the range of benefits offered appears to be expanding, employers' preferences regarding the structure of their group health plans have slowly migrated toward preferred provider organization-based plans. ####  ##### An overwhelming majority of employers surveyed  offer PPO health plans — 86% in 2013 compared with 83% in 2012 and 81% in 2009. The prevalence of health maintenance organization plans among employers increased by a single percentage point, to 33% in 2013 from 32% in 2012, but remained below the 35% of employers recorded in 2009. ####  ##### Point-of-service plans, meanwhile, have decreased steadily in the past five years, to 19% of employers in 2013 from 26% in 2009. ####  ##### The full results of SHRM's 2013 Employee Benefits Report are available here. #### "
"Diebold to freeze pension plan completely";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Retirement Benefits";" ##### Diebold Inc. is freezing its pension plan completely, concluding a process it began in 2003. ####  ##### About 3,000 employees will be affected by the latest freeze, a spokesman for the North Canton, Ohio-based provider of automatic teller machines, security systems and related services said in an email. Diebold has about 6,800 U.S. employees. ####  ##### “Diebold is getting more aggressive in its cost-saving efforts moving forward. As part of these actions, Diebold is freezing its defined benefit pension plan for U.S.-based employees who joined the company prior to July 1, 2003,” the company said in a statement reporting its second-quarter financial results. ####  ##### However, Diebold is sweetening its 401(k) plan matching contribution for employees affected by the freeze. Effective Jan. 1, 2014, the match will double, with Diebold matching 60% of employees' contributions up to 6% of pay. It now matches 30% of employees' contributions up to 6% of pay. ####  ##### At the end of 2012, Diebold's pension plan was just over 70% funded, with $674 million in benefit liabilities and $473 million in assets. At the end of the first quarter of this year, the plan was 81% funded, the Diebold spokesman said. #### "
"Conestoga Wood Specialties denied challenge to contraceptive rule";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Health Care Benefits";" ##### The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia on Wednesday denied Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp.'s application to re-argue its challenge of the health care reform law's contraceptive coverage requirement before the court's full roster of active judges. ####  ##### The East Earl, Pa.-based woodworking company is among the two dozen for-profit, family-owned businesses separately seeking to block the federal government from forcing employers with 50 or more employees to provide cost-free coverage for contraceptive prescriptions and other women's preventative care services under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ####  ##### The requirement, contained within the reform law's minimum coverage standards for employer-sponsored health benefits, went into effect last August. ####  ##### Conestoga Wood Specialties' application for a second hearing before the appeals court was voted down by seven of the court's 12 active judges. Last month, a panel of three 3rd Circuit judges rejected the company's initial appeal, in which it had hoped to overturn a lower court's January 11 ruling denying the company's motion for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the coverage requirement pending the outcome of the lawsuit. ####  ##### Having exhausted their opportunities for relief at the appellate level, attorneys representing Conestoga said in an email to Business Insurance that they will petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a reversal of both lower courts' rulings. ####  ##### “Every American, including family business owners, should be free to live and do business according to their faith,” said Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based conservative legal group representing Conestoga Wood Specialties. “The cost of religious freedom for the Hahn family, which owns Conestoga Wood Specialties, is the same as the cost to many other job creators across the country who face this mandate: the potential for massive fines that would cripple their businesses and threaten jobs. For this reason, we will be asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review this case.” ####  ##### Should the Supreme Court decline to grant Conestoga's request for a hearing, the case would revert back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where a judge has yet to rule on the actual merits of allegations that the health care reform law's contraceptive coverage requirement violates the company's individual owners' rights to exercise their Christian beliefs, which forbid them to use or provide contraceptive drugs. #### "
"Kodak emerges from bankruptcy with pension plans intact";"Benefits Management";"Benefits Management, Employment Practices, Retirement Benefits";" ##### When Eastman Kodak Co. emerged last week from its 20-month stay in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it did so with its pension plans intact, a move that is drawing praise from the federal agency that likely would have taken over the plans had Kodak moved to terminate them. ####  ##### “There have been times — far too many — when companies have entered bankruptcy and tried to unnecessarily shed their plans. Not Kodak. The company said they wanted to keep their plans going from the start and we applaud them for doing so,” the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. said in a statement Monday. ####  ##### The PBGC noted that it served on a committee of Kodak unsecured creditors and worked with the Rochester, N.Y.-based company to ensure the plans, which have about 63,000 participants, would continue. ####  ##### By keeping its pension plans, Kodak took a different path compared to some other big organizations, such as United Airlines Inc. and US Airways Group Inc., that filed for bankruptcy and said they could not afford to maintain their pension plans, with the PBGC later taking over the obligation to pay promised benefits to participants. ####  ##### Unlike those two airlines, whose pension plans were massively underfunded, Kodak’s plans have been relatively well-funded. ####  ##### At the end of the 2012, its U.S. pension plans were about 87% funded, with assets of $4.85 billion and $5.58 billion in liabilities, according to Kodak’s 2012 10-K report. ####  ##### With the rise since then in interest rates, which lowers the value of pension plan liabilities, and gains in the equities markets, the funding levels of Kodak’s plans likely are higher today. ####  ##### A Kodak spokesman said the company was “gratified” with the PBGC comments and will let those comments “speak for themselves.” #### "
"14 employers sign with Buck Consultants' private health exchange";"Benefits Management";"Health Care Benefits";" ##### Fourteen employers have signed up with Buck Consultants L.L.C.'s private health exchange to offer health coverage to their employees next year as employer interest in such exchanges continues to surge. ####  ##### Employers that will participate in the exchange include Atlanta-based Arby's Restaurant Group Inc., Columbus, Ohio-based Bob Evans Farms Inc., Ewing, N.J.-based Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Domino's Pizza Inc. and Greer, S.C.-based Ovation Brands, as well as Buck Consultants' parent company, Norwalk, Conn.-based Xerox Corp. ####  ##### In all, Buck said Wednesday, 400,000 employees and dependents will receive coverage through its exchange, RightOpt, which is available to employers with at least 3,000 employees. ####  ##### The exchange “provided Bob Evans Farms with an opportunity to more cost-effectively deliver a competitive employer-sponsored benefit program while providing expanded plan options and resources to our employees,” Pam Kuryla, the restaurant chain's vice president of total rewards, said in a statement. ####  ##### In all, the exchange offers seven health plan designs from 15 insurers, including Aetna Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna Corp. and Kaiser Permanente. ####  ##### The design of private insurance exchanges offered by Buck and others, which also are growing rapidly, is appealing to employers and employees, experts say. ####  ##### Through the exchange model, employers agree to provide a fixed premium contribution, with employees paying more or less for their share of the premium depending on the level of coverage they choose. Through that approach, employers can cap what they pay for employee health care coverage. ####  ##### In addition, the employer role as a health care plan sponsor becomes more limited, with exchange insurers handling claims and the exchange operator negotiating premium rates with insurers and assisting employees with questions. #### "
